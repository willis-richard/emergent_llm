**Final Strategy Design for N-Player Public Goods Game**

The proposed strategy is designed to adaptively balance cooperation and defection based on the observed behavior of other players, ensuring robust performance across a wide range of opponent behaviors. Here's the structured approach:

---

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**

**Initialization (Round 1):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - Purpose: Signal willingness to contribute and encourage others to cooperate.

**Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
- Calculate the average cooperation rate among all players over the last M rounds (e.g., M = 5).
- If the average cooperation rate is above a predefined threshold T:
  - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- Else:
  - **Action:** Defect (D)

**Final Round (Round r):**
- **Action:** Defect (D)
  - Reasoning: No future rounds for punishment, so maximize immediate payoff.

---

### **2. Parameters and Thresholds**

- **Threshold (T):** Set initially at 50%. This threshold can be adjusted dynamically based on observed payoffs:
  - If cooperating yields higher payoffs over time, increase T to encourage more cooperation.
  - If defecting proves more beneficial, decrease T.

- **Memory Window (M):** Use the last 5 rounds to calculate the average cooperation rate. This balance between responsiveness and stability allows quick adaptation without excessive volatility.

---

### **3. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Cooperation is chosen to foster a cooperative environment.
- **Last Round:** Defection ensures maximum immediate payoff, acknowledging no future rounds for punishment or reputation building.
- **Transition Periods:** If cooperation rates oscillate, the strategy adapts by switching actions based on recent history, allowing potential recovery from defection spirals.

---

### **4. Robustness and Adaptability**

The strategy is robust because it:
- Does not rely on specific opponent strategies, making it versatile against diverse behaviors.
- Adjusts dynamically using a threshold that can be fine-tuned based on observed outcomes.
- Balances exploration (initial cooperation) with exploitation (adapting to others' actions).

---

### **5. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(round_history, current_round, total_rounds):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round < total_rounds:
        # Calculate average cooperation rate over last M rounds (e.g., 5)
        M = min(5, len(round_history))
        recent_contributions = sum([round['cooperators'] for round in round_history[-M:]])
        avg_coop = recent_contributions / (M * n)  # Assuming n players
        if avg_coop > T:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Last round
        return 'D'
```

---

This strategy effectively navigates the complexities of repeated public goods games, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to maximize individual payoffs while adapting to changing dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_1 = '''
The strategy involves initially cooperating to encourage others to contribute, then exploiting periods of high cooperation by defecting. Here's a clear outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase**: Cooperate for the first 3 rounds to build a cooperative environment.

2. **Dynamic Exploitation and Contribution**:
   - From round 4 onwards, evaluate the average number of cooperators in the last 3 rounds.
   - If more than 50% of players cooperated on average, defect this round to exploit their contributions.
   - If cooperation is below 50%, cooperate to help rebuild the public good for future exploitation.

This approach balances exploiting others' cooperation and contributing when necessary to maintain a beneficial environment.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_2 = '''
**Strategy Description: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation**

The strategy begins with cooperation in the first round to encourage sustainability. It dynamically adjusts based on the current stock level and recent trends, switching to defection when necessary to prevent over-depletion. The threshold for cooperation is adjusted according to stock changes, ensuring adaptability to varying player behaviors.

---

**Decision Rules:**
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - If the current stock exceeds a dynamic threshold `T` and shows stability or growth, Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate gain, signaling potential resource scarcity.
3. **Final Round (Round r):** Always Defect to exploit remaining resources without future concerns.

---

**Threshold Adjustment:**
- After each round:
  - If the stock increased despite cooperation, raise `T` slightly.
  - If the stock decreased while defecting, lower `T` significantly to prompt more cautious behavior in future rounds.

---

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Ensures a cooperative start.
- **Last Round:** Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for sustainability.
- **Threshold Bounds:** Prevents `T` from exceeding capacity or dropping below zero, maintaining realistic adjustments.

---

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def adaptive_threshold_cooperation(n, r, capacity):
    T = 0.8 * capacity
    k = 3  # Window size for trend analysis
    last_stock_values = []
    
    for t in range(1, r+1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            current_stock = stock(t-1)
            last_stock_values.append(current_stock)
            
            if len(last_stock_values) > k:
                last_stock_values.pop(0)
                
            average_stock = sum(last_stock_values) / len(last_stock_values)
            
            trend = 0
            if len(last_stock_values) >= 2:
                trend = current_stock - last_stock_values[-2]
            
            if current_stock > T and trend >= 0:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'
        
        # Handle Last Round
        if t == r:
            action = 'D'
        
        # Adjust Threshold
        prev_action = action if t !=1 else 'C'  # For first round, action is C
        
        if prev_action == 'C':
            if current_stock < T:
                T *= 0.95  # Lower threshold slightly
                T = max(T, 0)
        elif prev_action == 'D':
            if current_stock > T:
                T *= 1.05  # Raise threshold slightly
                T = min(T, capacity)
        
        record_action(action)

    return

# Note: This pseudocode assumes a function `stock(t)` that returns the stock level at round t.
```

**Conclusion:**
This strategy balances cooperation and defection based on dynamic thresholds and recent trends, promoting sustainability while adapting to resource scarcity or exploitative behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_3 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for harvesting a shared resource among players over multiple rounds, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with defection based on current stock levels and previous player behavior. This strategy aims to maintain a sustainable resource level while protecting against exploitation.

**Answer:**

The proposed strategy involves:

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to build trust and sustain high stock levels.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels and Behavior:** In subsequent rounds, assess the current stock as a percentage of capacity and note how many players defected in previous rounds.
3. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - If the stock is above an upper threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) and defection rates are low, continue cooperating to allow maximum resource growth.
   - If the stock drops below a lower threshold (e.g., 50%) or if a significant number of players defect, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains and prevent further resource depletion.
4. **Time-Dependent Adjustment:** As the game progresses towards its end, increase the tendency to defect, reflecting the reduced impact of future rounds on total payoff.

**Edge Cases:**
- In the first round, cooperate without prior information.
- For the last few rounds (e.g., final 10%), prioritize defecting to capitalize on remaining resources.
- If the stock is critically low at any point, defect immediately to maximize limited gains.

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset where cooperation sustains higher payoffs for all, while defection protects against exploitation when others deviate. By dynamically adjusting behavior based on current conditions and future expectations, players can optimize their total payoff over the game's duration.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Adaptive Strategy}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_4 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining sustainable resource use while adapting to others' actions and nearing the end of rounds, a balanced strategy is proposed. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Each player starts by cooperating in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.
   - Parameters are set:
     - `window_size` (m): Number of recent rounds considered, e.g., min(r, 10).
     - `cooperation_threshold_start` (p_start): Initial threshold for cooperation, e.g., 70%.
     - `cooperation_threshold_end` (p_end): Threshold near the end, e.g., 50%.
     - `stock_threshold` (S_thresh): Stock level below which defection is favored, e.g., 60% of capacity.

2. **Each Round t:**
   a. **First Round (t = 1):** Cooperate to establish cooperation.
   b. **Last Round (t = r):** Defect to maximize payoff as there's no future impact.
   c. **Other Rounds (t ≠ 1 and t ≠ r):**
      i. **Analyze Recent Behavior:** Examine the past `window_size` rounds (or all if fewer) to count other players' Cooperations (`C_count`) divided by total possible actions to find the cooperation rate.
      ii. **Adjust Threshold Dynamically:** Calculate the current threshold `p(t)` which decreases linearly from `p_start` to `p_end` as rounds progress.
      iii. **Check Stock Level:** Determine if the current stock `S` is above or below `S_thresh`.
      iv. **Decision Making:**
          - Cooperate if cooperation rate > `p(t)` and `S >= S_thresh`.
          - Otherwise, defect.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If cooperation collapses early, players adapt by defecting more.
   - Maintain flexibility to adjust thresholds for different scenarios (e.g., varying n or r).

**Answer:**

The strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection based on others' actions and resource levels:

- Cooperate initially to encourage sustainability.
- Monitor recent cooperation rates among others and the current stock level.
- Use a dynamic threshold that decreases as rounds progress towards the end, encouraging defection in later stages.
- Defect if cooperation is low or resources are critically depleted.

This approach ensures adaptability while aiming for long-term resource preservation.

\boxed{\text{Adaptive Cooperation Strategy}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_5 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a multi-player game, we propose a dynamic strategy that adapts based on current stock levels and observed cooperation trends among players. The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoffs while considering the collective impact on resource preservation.

### Approach
The approach involves three primary phases, each with specific decision rules tailored to different stages of the game:

1. **Early Rounds**: Focus on maximizing immediate gains by defecting when the stock is high. Transition to cooperation if the stock drops significantly or if a majority of players cooperate.
2. **Mid Rounds**: Adjust strategies based on observed trends in cooperation and resource levels. Cooperate if the stock indicates potential stress and others are sustaining cooperative efforts.
3. **Late Rounds**: Prioritize immediate payoffs by defecting, as there is no future benefit to preserving the resource.

The strategy dynamically adjusts thresholds for cooperation or defection based on the current stock level and the observed behavior of other players. This adaptability ensures that the strategy remains effective even as the game progresses and conditions change.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, previous_cooperation):
    threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.6 * capacity

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'

    # Early rounds: prioritize defecting when stock is high
    if round_number < total_rounds / 2:
        if current_stock > threshold_high:
            return 'D'
        else:
            if previous_cooperation >= 0.5:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

    # Mid rounds: adjust based on cooperation trends and stock
    else:
        if current_stock < threshold_low:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock > threshold_high * (1 - round_number / total_rounds):
            if previous_cooperation >= 0.6:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            if previous_cooperation >= 0.7:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

    # Default to cooperate if none of the above
    return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The thresholds for high and low stock levels are set as percentages of the total capacity.
- **Early Rounds (First Half)**: Players defect when the stock is high to maximize immediate gains. They switch to cooperation if the stock drops below a threshold or if a majority of players have been cooperating in previous rounds.
- **Mid Rounds**: Players monitor both the stock level and the cooperation trends. Cooperation is encouraged if the stock is low or if a significant proportion of other players are cooperating, indicating sustainable practices.
- **Late Rounds (Last Few)**: Defection is prioritized to maximize immediate payoffs since there's no future benefit in preserving the resource.

This approach ensures that each player dynamically adjusts their strategy based on current conditions and observed behaviors, balancing between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_6 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for players in a game involving resource consumption and growth, we can outline a strategic approach that balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the proposed strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase**: 
   - In the first few rounds, all players should cooperate (choose C). This helps maintain or build up the stock level to a healthy threshold, ensuring that the resource can sustain future consumption.

2. **Threshold-Based Defection**:
   - Define two thresholds relative to the total capacity of the resource: a High Threshold (HT) and a Low Threshold (LT).
     - HT could be set at 80% of capacity.
     - LT could be set at 40% of capacity.
   - If the current stock level exceeds HT and has been increasing or stable over recent rounds, players should defect (choose D). This is because the resource is abundant enough to handle higher consumption without depleting significantly.
   - Conversely, if the stock falls below LT, immediate cooperation is necessary to prevent further depletion and allow for potential regrowth.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment Based on Trend**:
   - Calculate the trend of the stock level over the past few rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
     - If the trend indicates an increasing stock, it's safer to defect as the resource is replenishing.
     - If the trend shows a decreasing stock, cooperation becomes essential to conserve resources and encourage regrowth.

4. **Later Rounds Adjustment**:
   - As the game progresses towards its final stages (e.g., last 20% of rounds), players should gradually shift towards defection. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs in the remaining rounds, knowing that there are fewer future consequences for over-consumption.

5. **Feedback and Adaptation**:
   - After each round, assess whether total consumption was sustainable (i.e., growth >= total consumption).
     - If sustainability is confirmed, allow a bit more leniency towards defection in subsequent rounds.
     - If there's a net decrease in the stock, become more cautious by favoring cooperation to prevent further depletion.

6. **Collaborative Strategy Anticipation**:
   - Since all players are using the same strategy, their collective actions can be predicted. This predictability allows for smoother transitions between cooperation and defection phases without unexpected volatility in resource consumption.

By following this structured approach, players can maximize their individual gains while maintaining the health of the shared resource over time. The strategy balances immediate benefits with long-term sustainability, ensuring that the game's dynamics remain stable and beneficial for all participants.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate initially to build up resources, defect when conditions are favorable (high stock, positive trend), and adjust based on feedback. Specifically:

- **Start by Cooperating**: For the first few rounds, choose C to maintain resource levels.
- **Defect at High Levels**: Choose D if the stock exceeds 80% of capacity and is increasing.
- **Cooperate When Low**: If the stock drops below 40%, switch to C to preserve resources.
- **Adapt Based on Trends**: Monitor recent stock trends; cooperate if decreasing, defect if increasing.
- **Gradually Defect Later**: Shift towards D in the final rounds to maximize gains.

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability. The boxed answer is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially and when stock is low or decreasing; defect when high and increasing}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_7 = '''
The optimal strategy for maximizing individual payoffs while maintaining sustainable stock levels involves a dynamic approach based on the current state of the game and recent cooperation rates. Here are the key steps and decision rules:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to maximize the stock level for future rounds.
2. **Dynamic Thresholding**: Use a threshold that decreases as the game progresses. Players Cooperate if the current Sustainability Index (SI) is above their dynamic threshold, otherwise Defect.
3. **Stage-Based Adjustments**:
   - **Early Stages**: High threshold to encourage cooperation.
   - **Middle Stages**: Moderate threshold, adjusting based on past Cooperation Rates and SI trends.
   - **Late Stages**: Shift back towards higher cooperation to maximize payoffs without over-depleting the stock for non-existent future rounds.
4. **Feedback Mechanism**: If the stock drops significantly below a certain level, players increase cooperation in subsequent rounds to allow recovery.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - First round: Always Cooperate.
   - Last few rounds: Increase Cooperation to prevent endgame depletion and maximize individual payoffs.

The decision rule can be succinctly expressed as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock is above threshold or late stages; otherwise Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_8 = '''
The strategy is designed to balance cooperation with defecting when necessary, adapting to observed behavior and stock levels. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Thresholds

**Initialization:**
- Start by Cooperating (C) in the first round to encourage resource sustainability.

**For Each Round (from 1 to r):**

1. **Observe Current State:**
   - Check current stock level (S).
   - Review recent history of other players' actions and past stock levels.

2. **Determine Safe Thresholds:**
   - Define a safe stock threshold, e.g., 30% of capacity, to prevent collapse.
   - Calculate a cooperation score based on recent rounds (e.g., number of Cooperates vs Defects).

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **If it's the first round:** Choose Cooperate (C).
   - **If approaching the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%):**
     - If S is above a high threshold, Cooperate to sustain.
     - Else, Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Else:**
     - Check if stock S is below safe threshold or cooperation score indicates many Defectors:
       - If yes, choose Defect (D) to prevent further depletion and punish non-cooperation.
       - If no, choose Cooperate (C) to maintain resource health.

4. **Adjustments Based on History:**
   - Use a moving average of recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5) to weigh cooperation score more heavily on recent actions.
   - If detecting potential collapse (S approaching 0 in next rounds), choose Defect to maximize current gain.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock_history, other_actions):
    capacity = stock_history[0]  # initial capacity
    S = stock_history[-1]
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    safe_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    end_rounds = max(2, total_rounds // 10)
    
    if total_rounds - round_number < end_rounds:
        if S > 0.75 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    recent_defectors = sum(1 for a in other_actions[-3:] if a == 'D')
    cooperation_score = len(other_actions) - recent_defectors
    
    if S < safe_threshold or recent_defectors > (len(other_actions) * 0.6):
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization:** Start with Cooperate to build a sustainable base.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
  - First round: Cooperate to encourage mutual resource preservation.
  - Last few rounds: Switch to cautious behavior, Cooperating only if the stock is sufficiently high; otherwise, Defect to maximize payoff before the game ends.
- **Decision Logic:**
  - Monitor stock levels and recent actions of others.
  - If stock is too low or many opponents have Defected recently, switch to Defect to prevent resource collapse.
  - Otherwise, Cooperate to sustain the resource for mutual benefit.

This strategy adapts dynamically based on current conditions and past behavior, aiming to maintain a balance between cooperation and self-interest.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_9 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold**

1. **Initialization**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage mutual cooperation among all players.

2. **Midgame Adaptation**:
   - Monitor the stock level (S) and its trend over past rounds.
   - If S remains above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating to maintain sustainable use.
   - If S drops below this threshold due to increased Defection, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs while preventing further resource depletion.

3. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last few rounds (e.g., last 20%), consider increasing defection frequency to capture higher short-term gains since future rounds are limited.

4. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After defecting for a period, reassess the stock trend. If it stabilizes or increases, revert to Cooperating to encourage sustainability and potential mutual cooperation again.

5. **Dynamic Threshold**: Adjust the threshold based on historical data and opponent behavior patterns observed in previous rounds to enhance adaptability.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
Initialize cooperate = True
threshold = 0.8 * capacity

for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        stock_change = calculate_stock_trend()
        
        if current_stock >= threshold and stock_change > -epsilon:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    
    if action == D and current_stock < threshold:
        defect_rounds += 1
        if defect_rounds >= reset_threshold and check_stock_recovery():
            cooperate = True
            defect_rounds = 0

    record_action_and_payoff(action, payoff)
    
if t is in last 20% of rounds:
    action = D  # Adjust based on remaining rounds and stock status
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy starts with cooperation to foster a cooperative environment.
- It adapts by defecting when the resource is under threat to prevent further depletion.
- Forgiveness is incorporated to encourage sustainability if conditions improve.
- Endgame adjustments focus on maximizing individual payoffs in the final rounds.

This approach balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically to various opponent behaviors and game states.

description_COLLECTIVE_10 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize long-term payoffs by maintaining a sustainable common pool through adaptive cooperation.

---

### **1. Initial Considerations**
- The game begins with the stock at its maximum capacity (S = capacity). Each player can choose to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round.
- Cooperation leads to smaller immediate gains but preserves the resource for future rounds, while defection yields higher immediate payoffs at the risk of depleting the pool.

---

### **2. Strategy Design**

#### **a. Decision Rules:**
1. **Cooperation Threshold:**
   - Cooperate if a majority (or specified proportion) of other players cooperated in the previous round.
   - Defect if a significant portion defected, signaling a need to prompt others to reconsider their strategies.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Monitor the stock level and growth rate to assess sustainability.
   - If the stock is declining significantly due to high defection rates, adjust strategy towards cooperation to replenish the resource.

---

#### **b. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to set a positive precedent and encourage mutual resource preservation.
  
- **Last Round (Known):** Cooperate to maximize final payoff, assuming others follow the strategy.

- **Unknown Last Round:** Continue cooperating to sustain benefits indefinitely, focusing on long-term gains over short-term exploitation.

---

### **3. Collective Mindset Alignment**

- The strategy prioritizes group welfare by encouraging cooperation when beneficial, ensuring sustainable resource use and maximizing mutual payoffs.

---

### **4. Pseudocode Outline**

```python
def decide_action(history):
    # history contains previous rounds' actions and stock levels
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate proportion of cooperators in the last few rounds
    recent_coop = sum(1 for action in history[-5:] if action == 'C') / len(history[-5:])
    
    # Check if the majority cooperated
    if recent_coop > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Consider stock health; if it's low, prioritize cooperation to replenish
        if current_stock < (capacity * 0.4):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

---

### **5. Testing Edge Cases and Refinement**

- **Low Stock Threshold:** If the stock falls below a critical level (e.g., 40% of capacity), prioritize cooperation to prevent depletion.
- **Adaptive Learning:** Adjust thresholds based on historical payoffs, maintaining cooperation if it leads to higher cumulative benefits.

---

### **6. Conclusion**

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation when beneficial and adapting to other players' behaviors. It aims to maintain a healthy resource pool, ensuring mutual benefit for all participants over multiple rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_11 = '''
To design an optimal strategy for balancing cooperation and defection based on observed stock levels, we consider the following key points:

1. **Initial Phase**: Start by cooperating to encourage sustainability.
2. **Monitoring**: Track the average stock level over recent rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds) and observe trends in stock changes.
3. **Decision Making**:
   - If the average stock is above 80% of capacity and trending upwards or stable, continue cooperating.
   - If the average stock drops below 75% or shows a downward trend, start defecting to maximize immediate payoffs while signaling others about the need for conservation.
4. **Hysteresis**: Introduce different thresholds for switching between cooperation and defection to avoid oscillations. For example, switch to defect when the stock drops below 75%, and return to cooperate when it rises above 85%.
5. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last 10% of rounds, increase the tendency to defect as future impact is minimal.

### Final Strategy
The optimal strategy is to cooperate when the average stock level over recent rounds exceeds 80% of capacity and defect otherwise. This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

If the stock decreases after a round, indicating excessive consumption, players switch to Cooperating to help replenish the resource. Conversely, if the stock remains stable or increases, they can safely Defect for higher individual payoffs. In the final round, all players Defect since there's no future benefit to sustain.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if previous round caused a decrease; else defect. Always defect in last round}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_13 = '''
The optimal strategy for deciding whether to cooperate or defect is based on initial cooperation, monitoring others' actions and stock levels, and adapting behavior accordingly. Here are the key steps:

1. **Initial Rounds**: Start with cooperating to encourage sustainability and observe others' behaviors.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - Check if the current stock is above a critical level (e.g., 80% of capacity).
   - If both cooperation rate is high (say >60%) and stock is healthy, continue cooperating.
   - If either condition fails, switch to defecting.

3. **Final Rounds**: In the last few rounds, defect more aggressively since there's no future impact beyond maximizing immediate gains.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on observed behaviors and resource levels.

### Final Answer
The optimal strategy is to initially cooperate, monitor others' actions and stock levels, continue cooperating if cooperation rates are high and the stock remains healthy, and switch to defecting otherwise, especially in later rounds. This approach can be succinctly expressed as \boxed{\text{Cooperate Initially and Adapt Based on Observations}}.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_14 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a shared-resource setting, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to help maintain a healthy resource level for future rounds.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment Based on Stock Health**: For each subsequent round before the last:
   - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, continue Cooperating to sustain the resource.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoff, signaling overexploitation.

3. **Final Round Exploitation**: In the final round, defect to extract as much resource as possible without concern for future rounds.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set a cooperation threshold at 75% of capacity.
   - Track past stock levels and others' actions to inform decisions.

2. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate to contribute to maintaining the resource's health.

3. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - Compare the current stock level to the threshold (75% capacity).
     - If above: Cooperate, supporting sustainable use.
     - If below: Defect, prioritizing immediate gain when overexploitation is evident.

4. **Last Round Action**:
   - Always Defect to exploit remaining resources without regard for future sustainability.

### Justification

This strategy balances individual payoff maximization with collective resource sustainability. By Cooperating initially and continuing while the stock remains healthy, players contribute to long-term gains. Switching to Defecting when the stock is low prevents losses from overexploitation by others. Finally, defecting in the last round ensures maximum immediate benefit without concern for future depletions.

### Answer

The proposed strategy balances individual payoff maximization with collective resource sustainability as follows:

1. **Cooperate** in the first round to support resource health.
2. **Cooperate** in subsequent rounds if the stock remains above 75% of capacity; otherwise, **Defect**.
3. **Defect** in the final round to maximize immediate payoff.

This approach is encapsulated as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially and sustainably, defect when overexploitation occurs or in the final round}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_15 = '''
The optimal strategy is for each player to Cooperate in all rounds except the last one, where they Defect. This preserves the resource until the final round, allowing maximum payoffs without causing a crash.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate in all rounds except the last, where you defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_16 = '''
To address the problem of promoting cooperation while adapting to defection in a shared-resource setting, we can outline a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. This strategy is designed to encourage cooperative behavior when beneficial but also allows for self-interested actions when necessary.

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Initial Cooperation**:
   - Begin by cooperating in the first round. This sets a positive tone and supports sustainable use of the resource.
   
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**:
   - In each subsequent round, evaluate the current stock level relative to its capacity.
     - If the stock is above 80% of capacity, continue to cooperate. The resource is sufficiently healthy, and cooperation helps maintain it.
     
3. **Low Stock Response**:
   - If the stock drops below 30% of capacity, switch to defecting. At this point, the resource is critically low, and defecting allows you to maximize immediate gains before potential collapse.
   
4. **Middle Ground Decision**:
   - For stock levels between 30% and 80%, assess recent cooperation rates:
     a. Review the proportion of cooperators in the last few rounds (e.g., the past 5 rounds).
     b. If a majority were cooperating, continue to cooperate to support sustainability.
     c. If more players have been defecting, switch to defecting as well. This prevents being exploited by others and secures higher personal payoff.

### **Rationale**

- **Cooperation Initiation**: Starting with cooperation fosters an environment where sustainable practices can thrive, encouraging others to follow suit.
- **Stock Thresholds**: Using clear thresholds (80% and 30%) provides a structured approach to decision-making based on the resource's health. This helps in maintaining cooperation when it is beneficial and switching strategies when necessary.
- **Behavioral Adaptation**: By monitoring recent cooperation rates, the strategy adapts dynamically to changes in others' behaviors. It ensures that your actions align with the collective behavior of the group, either promoting sustainability or securing personal gains when defection prevails.

This approach effectively balances self-interest with the greater good, ensuring adaptability and sustainability based on current conditions and others' actions.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to adaptively balance cooperation and defection based on the observed state of the common pool. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. Initial Rounds (First Few):
- **Action:** Cooperate
  - Reasoning: Maintaining the stock at capacity ensures sustainable payoffs and prevents early depletion.

### 2. Middle Rounds:
- **Monitor Stock Level:**
  - Track the stock level after each round to detect trends of increase or decrease.
  - If the stock is consistently decreasing, it indicates that some players are defecting.

### 3. Adaptation Based on Stock Health:
- **Critical Threshold (e.g., 50% of Capacity):**
  - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to defecting more to maximize immediate gains.
  - Gradual Adjustment: Instead of an abrupt switch, increase defection rates as the stock decreases, only fully defecting near critical levels.

### 4. Endgame Handling:
- **Last Few Rounds:**
  - If the stock is above a certain level, cooperate to maintain it and avoid sudden depletion.
  - If the stock is low, defect to maximize remaining payoffs.

### Strategy Summary:

**Pseudocode:**

```
for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        stock_history = observe(stock_levels)
        if stock_level > threshold_high (e.g., 75% of capacity):
            action = Cooperate
        elif stock_level < threshold_low (e.g., 25% of capacity):
            action = Defect
        else:
            # Adjust based on trend and previous actions
            if stock_history shows decreasing trend:
                increase_defection_probability()
            else:
                decrease_defection_probability()
    play(action)
```

### Key Considerations:

- **Stock Dynamics:** The strategy relies on the observable state of the stock, using it as an implicit signal for others' behaviors.
- **Gradual Adaptation:** Avoids abrupt switches to prevent crashes and ensures smoother transitions between cooperation and defection phases.
- **Edge Cases:** Handles first and last rounds with specific actions to maintain sustainability or maximize payoffs.

This approach aims to maximize individual payoffs while sustaining the resource, balancing self-interest with collective preservation.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Cooperation Strategy**

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on observed player behavior, current stock levels, and the number of rounds remaining.

---

### **1. Initial Round (Round 1):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - Rationale: Starting with cooperation encourages sustainability and provides a basis for observing others' behaviors.

---

### **2. Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r):**
#### **a. Observation and Analysis:**
- Track the average cooperation rate of other players over past rounds.
- Consider weighting more recent rounds to adapt quickly to changing strategies.
- Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.

#### **b. Decision Criteria:**
1. **Average Cooperation Rate (ACR):**
   - If ACR > 60%:
     - Continue Cooperating (C) if the stock is above a safe threshold (e.g., half of capacity).
   - Else:
     - Tend towards Defecting (D) to prevent stock depletion.

2. **Stock Level:**
   - If stock < Safe Threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity):
     - Increase tendency to defect, even if ACR is high.

3. **Rounds Remaining:**
   - As rounds_remaining decreases:
     - Gradually increase the tendency to defect, especially in the last few rounds.

---

### **3. Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        # Calculate average cooperation rate of others (ACR)
        ACR = calculate_average_cooperation(others_actions, window=5)
        
        # Get current stock level
        S = current_stock
        
        # Determine safe threshold based on capacity
        safe_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        
        # Check rounds remaining
        rounds_remaining = r - t + 1
        
        if ACR > 0.6 and S >= safe_threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            # If stock is low or cooperation is low, defect
            action = D
            
    play action
```

---

### **4. Strategy Summary:**
- **Cooperate Initially:** Start with cooperation to encourage sustainability.
- **Adapt Based on Others' Behavior:** Observe and adapt to the average cooperation of others, defecting if too many players defect.
- **Consider Stock Levels:** Cooperate only if the stock is sufficiently high; defect otherwise to prevent collapse.
- **Adjust for Game End:** Increase defection as rounds remaining decrease to maximize immediate gains.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with responsiveness to other players' actions and changing game dynamics.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_19 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation for long-term sustainability while maximizing immediate gains, especially in scenarios where other players may defect, we propose a structured strategy. This strategy adapts based on the current state of the resource (stock level) and the behavior of other players.

### Approach
The approach is divided into three main phases:

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase**: Start by cooperating when the stock is at its maximum capacity to maintain a stable resource level.
2. **Sustainability Maintenance Phase**: Continue cooperating as long as the stock remains above a safe threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity). If the stock drops below this threshold despite others mostly cooperating, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds.
3. **Short-Term Maximization Phase**: In the last few rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoffs since there are no future rounds left for recovery.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, historical_cooperation):
    # Threshold definitions based on capacity
    threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.6 * capacity
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'Cooperate'  # Start with cooperation at full stock
    elif round_number >= total_rounds - 2:
        return 'Defect'     # Defect in last few rounds to maximize payoff
    
    # Check if the current stock is above high threshold
    if current_stock > threshold_high:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # If below high but above low, check historical cooperation and trends
    elif current_stock > threshold_low:
        # Calculate average cooperation rate from previous rounds
        avg_coop = sum(historical_cooperation) / len(historical_cooperation)
        
        if avg_coop >= 0.7:  # High cooperation among others
            return 'Cooperate'
        else:
            # Check if stock is decreasing despite our cooperation
            last_stock = historical_cooperation[-1]['stock']
            if current_stock < last_stock:
                return 'Defect'
            else:
                return 'Cooperate'
    else:  # Below low threshold, switch to defecting
        return 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins by cooperating when the stock is at its maximum capacity. This helps in maintaining a sustainable resource level.
  
- **Sustainability Check**: The strategy maintains cooperation as long as the stock remains above 80% of the capacity. If the stock drops below this threshold, it evaluates whether other players are also cooperating. If others are mostly cooperating but the stock is still decreasing, the strategy switches to defecting in subsequent rounds to maximize immediate gains.

- **Short-Term Maximization**: In the final few rounds, the strategy defects to ensure maximum payoffs since there are no future rounds left for recovery or resource replenishment.

This approach dynamically balances between maintaining cooperation for long-term sustainability and adapting to defect when necessary, ensuring a robust strategy against various player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_20 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining sustainable resource use among self-interested players without communication, we propose a conditional cooperation strategy based on observed behavior. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating, ensuring the resource remains at a sustainable level.

2. **Monitor Others' Actions**: Each player observes and records the actions (cooperate or defect) of all other players in each round over a specified window of past rounds.

3. **Calculate Average Cooperation Rate**: For each round, determine the average cooperation rate among other players by dividing the number of cooperators by the total number of other players.

4. **Set Thresholds**: Establish a threshold cooperation rate (e.g., 80%) above which players will continue to cooperate. If the observed rate falls below this threshold, players switch to defecting.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Review and adjust thresholds based on game dynamics, ensuring adaptability to different numbers of players and resource capacities.

6. **Feedback Loop**: Players reassess their strategy periodically using recent data, maintaining cooperation when others do and defecting when necessary to prevent over-depletion.

This strategy encourages mutual cooperation by rewarding those who sustain the resource and deters defection through collective action without communication.

**Answer:**

To balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a scenario where players cannot communicate, employ a conditional cooperation strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to maintain resource levels.
2. **Observe Behavior**: Track other players' actions over recent rounds.
3. **Calculate Cooperation Rate**: Determine the average rate at which others cooperate.
4. **Set Thresholds**: Cooperate if others' rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 80%); defect otherwise.
5. **Adjust Dynamically**: Modify thresholds based on game dynamics for adaptability.

This approach promotes sustainable resource use by fostering cooperation and deterring defection through observed behavior patterns.

To address the problem of managing a shared resource sustainably, we propose a strategic approach that balances cooperation with necessary defection based on the current state and trends of the resource. Here is the organized solution:

### Strategy for Managing Shared Resource

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - Always cooperate in the first round to start with a positive action, helping maintain the resource at its initial healthy level.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - **Cooperation Threshold**: Cooperate if the current stock is above 90% of capacity. This ensures the resource remains stable and sustainable.
   - **Defection Threshold**: Defect if the current stock drops below 20% of capacity. At this point, maximizing immediate payoff becomes crucial as recovery may not be feasible.

3. **Monitoring Trends**:
   - Track trends in the resource's health over recent rounds (e.g., using a moving average or observing consistent decreases despite cooperation). If the resource shows a significant downward trend despite others' cooperative efforts, consider defecting to prevent further depletion.

4. **Handling the Last Round**:
   - If the number of rounds is known and it's the last round, defecting may be optimal for maximizing individual payoff. However, this should be done cautiously as it can lead to a tragedy of the commons if others also defect.

### Summary of Decision Rules

- **Cooperate** when the current stock exceeds 90% of capacity.
- **Defect** when the stock falls below 20% of capacity.
- In between, continue cooperating to encourage resource recovery. If the resource shows a consistent decline despite cooperation, consider defecting to mitigate further loss.

This strategy aims to maximize long-term payoff by maintaining the resource's health while allowing for necessary defection in critical situations. It balances individual incentives with collective sustainability.

To address the problem of balancing exploitation and conservation of a shared resource in an environment where all players have perfect information, we can employ a straightforward threshold-based strategy. This strategy ensures that we take advantage of the resource when it's abundant while preserving it when it becomes scarce.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Thresholds:** Establish two thresholds based on the capacity of the shared resource:
   - High Threshold (T_high): Set at 75% of the resource's capacity.
   - Low Threshold (T_low): Set at 25% of the resource's capacity.

2. **Decision Rules:**
   - If the current stock level exceeds T_high (75%), defect to exploit the abundance.
   - If the current stock is below T_low (25%), cooperate to help preserve the resource.
   - Between these thresholds, employ a cautious approach by evaluating recent trends in stock levels and adjusting behavior accordingly.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:** Monitor the trend of stock levels over previous rounds. If the stock has been decreasing, increase the tendency to cooperate even if above T_low. Conversely, if the stock is increasing, lean towards defecting when above T_high.

4. **Implementation:** Apply these rules dynamically in each round based on the current stock level and recent trends to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

**Answer:**

To effectively manage the shared resource while considering the impact of all players' actions, employ a threshold-based strategy:

- Defect if the current stock exceeds 75% of capacity.
- Cooperate if the current stock falls below 25% of capacity.
- Adjust behavior cautiously between these thresholds based on recent trends in stock levels.

This approach ensures sustainable exploitation while mitigating the risk of resource depletion.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when stock is below 25% and defect when above 75%, adjusting cautiously in between.}}

**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection based on the current stock level, historical player behavior, and game dynamics. It promotes sustainability while adapting to exploiters.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: Cooperate or Defect?**

Players will:

- **Cooperate** if:
  - The current stock \( S \) is above a dynamically adjusted threshold \( T \).
  - A majority of players have cooperated in recent rounds, indicating collective effort to sustain resources.
  
- **Defect** if:
  - \( S \) is below \( T \), signaling immediate gains are necessary before depletion.
  - Recent actions show significant defection, prompting self-protection.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage resource growth and set a positive trend.
  
- **Last Round (Round r)**:
  - Defect if others are expected to defect to maximize immediate payoff.
  - Consider cooperating if expecting mutual cooperation, ensuring shared benefits.

- **Stock Near Capacity or Zero**:
  - Cooperate near capacity to sustain growth.
  - Defect near zero to salvage remaining resources before depletion.

---

### **3. Collective Mindset:**

The strategy emphasizes long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation when beneficial for the group. Players weigh immediate gains against future sustainability, aiming for mutual benefits through resource preservation.

---

### **Implementation Summary:**

- **Initial Threshold \( T \)**: Set as a fraction of capacity (e.g., 50%).
- **Adaptation**: Adjust \( T \) based on stock trends and player behavior.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitor recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5) to gauge cooperation levels.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = maximum_stock_level
    r = total_rounds
    
    # Dynamic threshold adjustment based on stock health
    if stock > 0.5 * capacity:
        threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    else:
        threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    
    # Check recent cooperation trends
    recent_coop_count = sum(1 for h in history[-5:] if 'C' in h.values())
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:
        # Last round: defect if expecting others to defect, else cooperate
        if recent_coop_count / len(history) < 0.5:

        else:
            return 'C'
    else:
        if stock > threshold and recent_coop_count >= n * 0.6:
            return 'C'

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

**Objective:** To maximize long-term collective payoff by balancing individual gains with sustainable resource management.

---

#### **1. Decision Rules**

Players use an *adaptive threshold* approach to decide whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round, based on the current stock level and historical trends.

**Threshold Formula:**
- Calculate a dynamic threshold `T` for cooperation:
  \[
  T = \text{capacity} \times (1 - \alpha)
  \]
  where `α` is an adaptation factor derived from historical stock trends.
  
**Dynamic Adaptation of α:**
- Initialize `α` as 0.2 (moderate conservation).
- After each round, update `α` based on the average stock level over the past 3 rounds:
  - If stock increases or remains stable: decrease `α` by 5% (encourage cooperation).
  - If stock decreases: increase `α` by 10% (punish defection).

**Cooperation vs. Defection Decision:**
- Cooperate (C) if current stock \( S \geq T \).
- Defect (D) if current stock \( S < T \).

---

#### **2. Edge Case Handling**

##### **First Round:**
- Start with Cooperation to preserve the initial high stock level and encourage others to follow suit.
  - Set `α = 0.1` for the first round to promote cooperation.

##### **Last Round (Round r):**
- Defect unconditionally in the last round since there is no future payoff to consider.
  - Override threshold-based decision to maximize immediate gain.

##### **Near-Zero Stock:**
- If stock \( S < n \times \text{minimum consumption} \), all players will defect to prevent total depletion.

---

#### **3. Collective Alignment**

The strategy aligns with a *collective mindset* of sustainability and mutual benefit by:

1. Encouraging cooperation when the resource is abundant (above threshold).
2. Punishing defection through dynamic adaptation of `α` when the resource is threatened.
3. Prioritizing long-term payoff over short-term gains.

---

#### **4. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def atc_strategy(player_index, history, current_stock):
    # Parameters initialization
    capacity = 100  # Example value; replace with actual game parameter
    n = 4           # Number of players
    
    if not hasattr(atc_strategy, 'alpha'):
        atc_strategy.alpha = 0.2  # Initial adaptation factor
    
    # Calculate threshold for cooperation
    threshold = capacity * (1 - atc_strategy.alpha)
    
    # Historical stock trends adjustment
    if len(history) >= 3:
        recent_stock_avg = sum([h['stock'] for h in history[-3:]]) / 3
        if current_stock > recent_stock_avg:
            atc_strategy.alpha = max(atc_strategy.alpha - 0.05, 0.1)
        else:
            atc_strategy.alpha = min(atc_strategy.alpha + 0.1, 0.8)
    
    # Decision rules
    if current_stock >= threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Edge case handling: Last round
if current_round == r:
    return 'D'
```

---

### Explanation

- **Adaptive Threshold (T):** Dynamically adjusts based on historical stock trends to balance cooperation and defection.
- **Initial Conservation:** Starts with moderate cooperation in the first round to encourage collective resource preservation.
- **Defection Punishment:** Gradually increases `α` when stock decreases, making it harder for players to cooperate in future rounds (punishing past defection).
- **Robustness:** The strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors because it does not rely on coordination or knowledge of other players' strategies—it only depends on observable state and history.

This approach promotes a collective mindset while ensuring individual adaptability to changing game conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_25 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation**

1. **Initial Target**: Set an initial target at 75% of the capacity (0.75 × capacity). Players Cooperate if the current stock is above this target; otherwise, they Defect.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment**: After each round:
   - If the stock increased from the previous round, lower the target by a small adjustment factor to encourage more cooperation.
   - If the stock decreased or remained stable despite cooperation, raise the target slightly to conserve resources.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate as the stock is at maximum capacity.
   - **Last Few Rounds (r-2 onwards)**: Switch to Cooperating again to prevent a final rush of Defectors, ensuring sustainable resource management.

4. **Feedback Loop**: Players adjust their target based on the stock's trend, maintaining sustainability and preventing over-consumption.

5. **Consistency and Adaptability**: By following the same rules, players create a self-reinforcing loop encouraging cooperation when resources are abundant. The strategy adapts to changing conditions caused by other opponents' behaviors.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```python
capacity = given_capacity
target = 0.75 * capacity
adjustment_factor = 0.01 * capacity  # 1% of capacity

for current_round in range(1, r + 1):
    if current_round == 1 or current_round >= r - 2:
        action = "Cooperate"
    else:
        if stock >= target:
            action = "Cooperate"
        else:
            action = "Defect"
    
    # Perform the round with 'action'
    
    # After the round, update target based on stock change
    new_stock = min(S_remaining + growth, capacity)
    if new_stock > previous_stock:
        # Stock increased; allow more cooperation
        target = max(target - adjustment_factor, 0.5 * capacity)
    else:
        # Stock decreased or same; conserve resources
        target = min(target + adjustment_factor, capacity)

    previous_stock = new_stock
```

This strategy ensures a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation levels based on the observed state of the resource pool.

To design a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that balances individual gain with sustainability, we propose an adaptive approach based on current stock levels and recent player behavior. The strategy encourages cooperation when sustainable but allows defecting to prevent resource depletion or exploitation.

### Strategy Description

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to promote initial sustainability.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds (t=2 to r-1):**
  - Calculate the defect rate from the previous round.
    - If more than half of players defected, defect this round.
    - Otherwise, check the current stock level relative to capacity.
      - If the stock is below a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), defect.
      - Else, cooperate.

- **Last Round (t=r):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff as there's no future impact.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- In the first round, always cooperate to encourage others to maintain sustainability.
- In the last round, defect since there’s no need for future cooperation.
- If the stock drops below a critical threshold despite low defect rates, switch to defecting to prevent further depletion.

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

The strategy promotes collective welfare by cooperating when sustainable and defecting only when necessary, thus balancing individual gains with group interests.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_round, current_stock, capacity, previous_defects):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        defect_rate = sum(previous_defects) / len(previous_defects)
        if defect_rate > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
            if stock_ratio < 0.6:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy starts by cooperating to set a sustainable tone.
- In subsequent rounds, it considers both recent player behavior and the resource's state.
- If many players are defecting or resources are low, it defects to prevent further harm.
- By adapting based on current conditions, the strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_27 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - All players Cooperate (C) to maximize initial payoff and set a foundation for future cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Each player observes the current stock level.
     - If the stock is above 60% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock drops below 40%, switch to Defecting to apply collective punishment and encourage others to cooperate.
   - Implement hysteresis: Once players start Defecting (when stock < 40%), they continue until the stock recovers above 70%.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Rounds r-2, r-1, r):**
   - Increase tendency towards Defection as there is no future interaction to penalize defection.
   - However, maintain some cooperation if the stock is healthy to prevent total collapse.

4. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Players track the stock history and use a moving average to assess trends (declining or stable).

5. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Maintain consumption rates based on current stock levels to balance personal payoff with resource sustainability.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
for each round in 1..r:
    if round == 1:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        if stock > 0.6 * capacity:
            action = Cooperate
        elif stock < 0.4 * capacity and previous_action_defect:
            action = Defect
        elif stock <= 0.7 * capacity:
            if random() < defect_probability:
                action = Defect
            else:
                action = Cooperate
    perform action, update payoff, adjust stock accordingly
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to build a cooperative foundation.
- **Threshold-Based Actions:** Uses clear thresholds (60%, 40%, 70%) to decide between cooperation and defection, ensuring adaptability without frequent oscillations.
- **Hysteresis Mechanism:** Prevents rapid switching by requiring higher thresholds for reverting to cooperation after defection starts.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** Adjusts behavior in the final rounds to account for no future interactions while still attempting to maintain resource levels.

This strategy balances individual incentives with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation while being robust against defection and varying opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_28 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that adapts based on the current state of the stock and historical actions of other players. The goal is to balance cooperation for sustainable resource use with defection when necessary to prevent rapid depletion.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same, fostering a collaborative environment.
2. **Adaptive Behavior**: For subsequent rounds (from 2 to r-2), adjust actions based on the previous round's cooperation levels and current stock health:
   - If more than 70% of players Cooperated last round and the stock is above 60% capacity, continue Cooperating.
   - Otherwise, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gain while others may be depleting resources.
3. **Final Rounds Strategy**: In the last two rounds (r-1 and r):
   - If the stock is above 70% and cooperation has been high, Cooperate to allow some growth before the game ends.
   - Otherwise, Defect to secure higher immediate payoffs, recognizing that future rounds are limited.

### Decision Rules:

- **Cooperation Conditions**:
  - Previous round had >70% Cooperators.
  - Current stock is above 60% of capacity.
  
- **Defection Conditions**:
  - Less than or equal to 70% Cooperators in the previous round.
  - Stock is low (below 60%) or declining.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Round**: Defect if stock is high to maximize payoff; otherwise, Cooperate slightly to allow minimal growth.
- **Low Stock**: If stock drops below a threshold (e.g., 30%), prioritize Defection to salvage remaining resources.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    current_round = len(history) + 1

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    prev_coop_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C')
    prev_coop_percentage = prev_coop_count / n
    
    if current_round >= r - 1:
        if current_stock > 0.7 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    if prev_coop_percentage > 0.7 and current_stock > 0.6 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Rationale:

- **Sustainability Focus**: By Cooperating when others do, the strategy maintains a healthy stock level for future rounds.
- **Reactiveness**: Adjusting based on previous actions allows the strategy to adapt to changing player behaviors and stock conditions.
- **Risk Management**: In later rounds, the strategy shifts towards maximizing immediate gains if cooperation has failed, preventing total depletion.

This approach ensures that the strategy is both adaptive and robust, capable of performing well across a variety of opponent behaviors while aiming for a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

**Strategy Description: Adaptive Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy aims to balance individual gain with collective sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation based on stock levels, trends, and opponents' behavior.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first few rounds to establish a baseline of behavior and assess others' strategies.

2. **Stock Level Assessment:**
   - **High Stock (>50% capacity):** Cooperate to sustain resource levels, promoting long-term benefits.
   - **Medium Stock (30%-50% capacity):** Cooperate if others are cooperating; defect if many opponents are defecting.
   - **Low Stock (<30% capacity):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff before potential resource crash.

3. **React to Opponents:**
   - Track the number of defectors. If a significant proportion (e.g., >50%) defect, increase defection frequency.

4. **Endgame Handling:**
   - In the last 1-2 rounds, switch to defecting for maximum immediate payoff since future rounds are irrelevant.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, history, remaining_rounds):
    # Initial cooperation in first few rounds
    if len(history) < 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate stock thresholds
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    medium_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    # Check current stock level
    if stock > medium_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif stock < low_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Medium stock: check opponents' behavior
        recent_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-5:] if action == 'D')
        if (recent_defectors / len(history[-5:])) > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

    # Endgame strategy
    if remaining_rounds <= 2:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by cooperating to observe others' strategies and build a sustainable resource base.
- **Stock-Based Decisions:** Adjusts cooperation based on the stock level, aiming to sustain resources when abundant and defecting when low to maximize immediate gain.
- **Opponent Behavior Tracking:** Monitors opponents' actions; if many defect, it adapts by increasing defection frequency to prevent exploitation.
- **Endgame Focus:** Switches to defection in final rounds to exploit the resource for maximum payoff before the game ends.

This strategy balances individual and collective interests, adapting dynamically to maintain sustainability while responding to potential exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_30 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Collective Play**

1. **Initial Round Decision**: Begin with Cooperation to support sustainable resource growth.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation**: After each round, assess the number of Cooperators and Defectors. Use this information to inform future decisions.

3. **Defection Threshold**: Establish a threshold based on stock levels or player actions. If the stock drops below 60% of capacity after several rounds of attempted Cooperation, switch to Defecting in subsequent rounds.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Continuously adjust your strategy based on recent player behavior. If a significant number of players are defecting, consider switching strategies to maximize immediate gains and encourage others to Cooperate.

5. **Last Round Consideration**: In the final round, prioritize maximizing individual gain while maintaining awareness that other players might also be Defecting.

6. **Collective Mindset**: Encourage Cooperation by leading with it, understanding that long-term benefits outweigh short-term gains from Defection.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function decide_action(round_history, current_stock):
    if round is first:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        count_coop = number of players who Cooperated in last rounds
        stock_trend = calculate_stock_trend(round_history)
        
        if count_coop > n/2 and stock_trend >= 0.6 * capacity:
            return Cooperate
        elif current_stock < 0.6 * capacity or count_defect > n/2:
            return Defect
        else:
            return Cooperate

def calculate_stock_trend(round_history):
    # Calculate average stock over recent rounds
    pass
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with Cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base.
- **Monitoring and Adjustment**: Continuously evaluates the effectiveness of Cooperation by tracking player actions and stock levels. Adjusts strategy dynamically based on these metrics.
- **Threshold for Defection**: Switches to Defecting if the stock falls below 60% capacity or if more than half of players are defecting, preventing exploitation and maximizing gains before resource depletion.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with immediate gains, adapting to the behaviors of other players while promoting collective cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_31 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy balances cooperation with defection based on the observed state of the common pool. It aims to sustain the resource while adapting to others' behaviors.

1. **Initial Rounds:** Cooperate in the first 3-5 rounds to encourage a cooperative environment and maintain stock stability.

2. **Monitoring Stock Levels:** After each round, check if the stock after consumption is above or below a threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity).

3. **Detecting Overuse:** If the stock drops below 80% for three consecutive rounds, switch to defecting in the next few rounds to either gain more while the pool is still available or signal others.

4. **Adjusting Based on Recovery:** After switching to defection, if the stock starts recovering (increasing towards capacity) over two or three rounds, revert to cooperation.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Continue Cooperating if the stock is still high; this maintains moderate gains without risking a crash.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
for each round in r:
    if current_round == 1:
        choose C
    else:
        if previous_stock_levels > threshold (e.g., 80% capacity) for most rounds:
            choose C
        elif stock_drops_below_threshold_consecutively(3):
            choose D
        else:
            if recent_recovery_in_stock():
                switch back to C
```

This strategy adaptively balances between cooperation and defection, aiming to maintain a sustainable resource level while responding to collective behavior.

description_COLLECTIVE_32 = '''
**Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize long-term payoffs by balancing cooperation and defection based on the state of the common pool resource. It adapts dynamically to sustain the resource while capitalizing on opportunities when necessary.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start with maximum sustainability, encouraging others to do the same and maintaining a healthy stock level.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **If Stock is Healthy:**
     - **Condition:** Current stock ≥ 70% of capacity AND increasing in the last few rounds.
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Rationale:** Sustaining cooperation maintains resource health and ensures steady payoffs.

   - **If Stock is Depleting:**
     - **Condition:** Current stock < 70% of capacity OR decreasing in the last few rounds.
     - **Action:** Defect.
     - **Rationale:** Higher immediate payoff while preventing further over-depletion, which could lead to resource collapse.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize payoffs in the final rounds without concern for future sustainability since there are no subsequent rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Stock Near Zero:**
  - **Condition:** Stock is very low (near 0).
  - **Action:** Defect.
  - **Rationale:** Salvage any remaining payoff before the resource crashes.

- **Stock Recovery:**
  - **Condition:** After defecting, stock recovers above 70% and shows increasing trend.
  - **Action:** Switch back to Cooperate.
  - **Rationale:** Re-engaging in cooperation helps sustain the resource again for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```pseudocode
for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = C
    elif t > 0.9 * r:  # Last 10% of rounds
        action = D
    else:
        stock_trend = check_stock_trend()
        if current_stock >= 0.7 * capacity and stock_trend == increasing:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    submit_action(action)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by cooperating to maintain sustainability, setting a positive precedent.
- **Adaptive Defection:** Monitors the stock's health and trends. If the stock is depleting or below a threshold (70%), defects to maximize immediate gains while preventing further overuse.
- **Final Round Strategy:** In the last 10% of rounds, defects to extract maximum possible payoff without worrying about future sustainability.

This strategy balances between maintaining resource health and maximizing payoffs, adapting dynamically based on observed conditions.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation and defection based on the current state of the common pool and the progression of the game. The goal is to sustain the resource while maximizing payoffs, adapting dynamically to changes in stock levels and rounds remaining.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource level.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: Continuously assess the current stock against predefined thresholds (70% as high, 30% as low).
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**:
   - **Cooperate** if the stock is above 70%, indicating sustainability.
   - **Defect** if the stock drops below 30%, signaling potential collapse.
4. **Mid-Game Adjustments**: If the stock trends downward despite cooperation, switch to defection to prevent further depletion.
5. **Endgame Defection**: In the last 10% of rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoffs with no future rounds left.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(stock, round_number, total_rounds, capacity):
    high_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    endgame_trigger = total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10)
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    if round_number > endgame_trigger:
        return 'D'  # Defect in the last 10% of rounds
    
    if stock >= high_threshold and (stock - capacity) < 0:  # Stock is high but not exceeding capacity
        return 'C'
    elif stock <= low_threshold or (stock - capacity) > 0:  # Stock is too low or over capacity
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Check if the stock is growing and cooperation rate is sufficient
        if calculate_growth(stock, capacity) > 0 and count_cooperate_last_round() / n > 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

def calculate_growth(current_stock, capacity):
    remaining = current_stock - sum(consumptions)
    growth = 2 * remaining * (1 - remaining / capacity)
    return growth
```

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Few Rounds**: Switch to Defecting as there's no future benefit in preserving the resource.

This strategy aims to sustain the common pool while adaptively responding to stock levels and game progression, promoting collective cooperation for long-term benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_34 = '''
To design a robust strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on balancing immediate payoffs with sustainable resource management. The strategy adapts based on the current stock level relative to a dynamic threshold, encouraging cooperation when resources are sufficient and defecting when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to maintain or build up the stock.
2. **Dynamic Threshold**: Use a dynamic threshold to decide between cooperation and defection. The threshold adjusts based on previous rounds' stock changes.
3. **Threshold-Based Decision**:
   - **Cooperate**: If the current stock is above the threshold, especially in early rounds.
   - **Defect**: If the stock is at or below the threshold, especially as the game progresses or near its end.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds):
    # Initial threshold set at 75% of capacity
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    
    # Adjust threshold based on previous stock changes (hypothetical function)
    if round_number > 1:
        threshold *= 0.95  # Lower threshold slightly each round to account for depletion risk
    
    # Check if it's the last round
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'  # Defect in the last round to maximize immediate gain
    
    # Decision based on current stock relative to threshold
    if current_stock >= threshold and (round_number != total_rounds):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage over rounds
for t in range(1, r+1):
    action = decide_action(stock_level[t], capacity, t, r)
    # Record action and update stock for next round
```

### Decision Rules:

- **Cooperate (C)**: When the current stock is above the dynamic threshold, indicating sufficient resources to sustain cooperation.
- **Defect (D)**: When the current stock is at or below the threshold, signaling potential depletion risks.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round**: Always cooperate to maintain a high starting point and encourage others to do the same.
- **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future punishment.
- **Unknown Last Rounds**: Treat each round similarly, using the dynamic threshold approach to balance between cooperation and defection.

### Robustness:

This strategy is robust as it dynamically adjusts to changing stock levels, encouraging cooperation when resources are plentiful and defecting when necessary. It doesn't rely on others' strategies beyond observing the stock, making it adaptable against various opponent behaviors.

By following this strategy, players aim to maximize their total payoffs over multiple rounds while maintaining sustainable resource management, leading to more stable outcomes compared to static cooperation or defection strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_35 = '''
To address the problem of sustaining cooperation while maximizing individual payoff over multiple rounds, the proposed strategy is as follows:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same.

2. **Adaptive Cooperation**: For each subsequent round before the last 25%, observe the percentage of players who Cooperated in the immediately preceding round.
   - If more than half (50%) of the players Cooperated, continue to Cooperate.
   - If 50% or fewer Cooperated, switch to Defecting.

3. **Final Stage Exploitation**: In the last 25% of rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate gains without concern for future consequences.

**Answer**: 

The optimal strategy involves initially Cooperating, then mirroring the majority's action in each round until the final quarter, where you switch to Always Defecting. This balances sustaining cooperation when possible with exploiting when beneficial. The strategy is encapsulated as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; mirror majority actions; defect in last 25%.}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_36 = '''
To address the repeated resource management dilemma, we propose a threshold-based strategy that balances cooperation for sustainability with defection for maximizing immediate payoffs. Here's how it works:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Threshold Setting:**
   - **Upper Threshold (H):** Set at 75% of capacity.
   - **Lower Threshold (L):** Set at 60% of capacity.

2. **Decision-Making Rule:**
   - If the current stock level is above H, choose to **cooperate**.
   - If the current stock level is below L, choose to **defect**.
   - Between H and L, additional strategies (e.g., probabilistic cooperation) can be employed.

### Detailed Implementation Steps:

1. **Monitor Current Stock:**
   At each round, assess the current stock level relative to capacity.

2. **Apply Thresholds:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** If stock > 75% of capacity.
     - This maintains resource levels for future rounds.
   - **Defect (D):** If stock < 60% of capacity.
     - Indicates resource overuse; defecting maximizes immediate gain.

3. **Intermediate Range Handling:**
   Between 60% and 75%, consider a gradient approach:
   - Increase cooperation probability as stock approaches H.
   - Decrease cooperation (favor defection) as stock approaches L.

4. **Time-Based Adjustment (Optional):**
   If aware of the remaining rounds, slightly lower H and raise L in later stages to encourage defecting as future impacts diminish.

5. **Continuous Evaluation:**
   Periodically review strategy outcomes and adjust thresholds if necessary to enhance both short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

### Conclusion:
This strategy effectively navigates the trade-off between cooperation for sustainable resource management and defection for immediate payoff optimization, ensuring adaptability across varying game dynamics.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_37 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold Adjustment**

1. **Initial Rounds (Cooperation Phase):**
   - In the first few rounds, always cooperate to encourage a healthy resource base and set a positive trend.

2. **Dynamic Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
   - After the initial cooperation phase, each player calculates an internal threshold based on the observed stock levels.
   - If the current stock (S) is above this threshold, the player cooperates; if below, they defect.
   - The threshold is adjusted dynamically to reflect trends in the stock's health:
     - If the stock is increasing or stable, lower the threshold slightly to encourage more cooperation.
     - If the stock is decreasing significantly, raise the threshold to promote defection and prevent further depletion.

3. **Stock Health Monitoring:**
   - Calculate the average stock level over the past few rounds to determine if it's trending upwards, downwards, or remaining stable.
   - Use this trend to adjust the cooperation-defection balance:
     - Stable or increasing stocks: Increase cooperation efforts.
     - Decreasing stocks: Shift towards more defection to capitalize on remaining resources before collapse.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to initiate a positive cycle of resource management.
   - **Last Few Rounds (Endgame Strategy):** Switch to defecting in the final rounds since there's no future payoff to consider, maximizing immediate gains.

5. **Gradual Adjustment and Smoothing:**
   - Use a weighted average of past stock levels to smooth out short-term fluctuations and base decisions on longer-term trends.
   - Include a mechanism to gradually reduce defection as the stock recovers, preventing overshooting and resource crashes.

6. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   - Encourage each player to independently adjust their actions based on observed stock health, promoting a collective effort to sustain resources without direct communication.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, round_number):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    r = total_rounds

    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to build up resource
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'

    # Calculate past stock trends
    recent_stocks = history[-5:]  # Adjust window size as needed
    average_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
    trend = calculate_trend(recent_stocks)

    # Determine threshold based on current and past stocks
    if trend == 'increasing' or trend == 'stable':
        threshold = max(capacity * 0.6, average_stock - (capacity * 0.1))
    else:
        threshold = min(capacity * 0.4, average_stock + (capacity * 0.1))

    # Decision based on current stock relative to threshold
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def calculate_trend(stock_levels):
    # Implementation to determine if stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable
    pass

# Example usage
history = [100, 95, 80, 75, 60]
current_stock = 60
round_number = 5
action = decide_action(history, current_stock, round_number)
print(action)  # Output: 'D'
```

**Conclusion:**
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation and defection based on the resource's health. It promotes collective responsibility without relying on explicit coordination, making it robust against various opponent behaviors in a tournament setting.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation and Defection Based on Stock and Player Behavior**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Moves):**
   - Start by Cooperating to foster a sustainable stock level and encourage other players to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Decision Criteria:**
     - **Cooperate** if:
       - The majority of players Cooperated in the previous round.
       - Current stock is above 50% of capacity, indicating sufficient resource sustainability.
     - **Defect** if:
       - A significant number of players Defected in the last round, leading to a noticeable drop in stock.
       - Current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), suggesting that future rounds may be unsustainable regardless of current actions.

3. **Later Rounds (As Rounds Remaining Decrease):**
   - Shift towards Defecting more frequently as the number of remaining rounds diminishes, prioritizing immediate gains since there's less incentive to maintain the stock for nonexistent future rounds.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to initiate a sustainable resource pool.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize individual payoff without concern for future depletions.

**Rationale:**
- This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting based on the observed behavior of other players and the current state of the common pool. It encourages cooperation when beneficial but switches to defection if necessary to prevent resource collapse or exploit situations where others are defecting. The approach is robust against varying opponent behaviors and dynamic stock conditions.

**Implementation:**
- Monitor the proportion of Cooperate/Defect actions in each round.
- Track stock levels relative to capacity to adjust thresholds dynamically.
- Gradually increase defection tendency as rounds progress, especially when nearing the end game.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while considering the collective impact on resource sustainability.

To address the problem of sustaining cooperation while avoiding exploitation in a public goods scenario, the proposed strategy balances contribution with self-interest based on observable conditions. Here's a structured summary:

**Strategy: Conditional Cooperation Based on Stock Level**

1. **Cooperate**: If the current stock level (S) is above 80% of its maximum capacity.
2. **Defect**: Otherwise, if S drops below this threshold.

This approach ensures that players contribute to maintaining the resource when it's healthy but switch to exploiting it when it starts to dwindle, aiming to prevent rapid depletion while allowing for potential recovery.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate when the stock exceeds 80% of its maximum capacity and defect otherwise. This balances contribution with self-interest to sustain the resource.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if S > 80\% of capacity, else Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_40 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**
Maximize individual payoff over multiple rounds by balancing resource conservation and exploitation, while adaptively responding to others' behaviors.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative baseline to sustain higher stock levels and encourage mutual benefits.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Past Behavior:**
     - Track the number of defects from other players in recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - **Adjust Strategy Based on Defect Rate:**
     - If defect rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%), switch to Defecting for the next few rounds to signal disapproval and protect against exploitation.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - **High Stock Levels (Above 75% of capacity):**
     - Cooperate to maintain resource health and optimize future payoffs.
   - **Moderate Stock Levels (Between 25%-75% capacity):**
     - Balance between Cooperating and Defecting based on observed defect rates.
   - **Low Stock Levels (Below 25% capacity):**
     - Consider Defecting to exploit remaining resources, but cautiously to avoid collapse.

4. **Last Few Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Lean towards Defecting.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited or nonexistent, reducing incentives for long-term cooperation.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:**
  - Default to Cooperate to initiate a cooperative environment.

- **Last Few Rounds (Last 5% of total rounds):**
  - Shift towards Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future repercussions.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```pseudocode
function decide_action(round_number, stock_level, past_defects):
    if round_number == 1:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        defect_rate = calculate_defect_rate(past_defects)
        
        if stock_level > 0.75 * capacity:
            return Cooperate
        elif stock_level < 0.25 * capacity:
            return Defect
        else:
            if defect_rate > threshold (e.g., 30%):
                return Defect
            else:
                return Cooperate
                
    # For last few rounds
    if round_number >= total_rounds - last_5_percent:
        return Defect
```

**Conclusion:**
This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior, stock levels, and game progression. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and adjusts to exploit or protect against exploitation as needed, ensuring robust performance across diverse scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_41 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to encourage cooperation while adaptively responding to other players' behaviors and the state of the resource. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first few rounds to foster a cooperative environment and gather information about others' actions.

2. **Monitor Behavior**: Track the average cooperation rate among other players each round to inform decision-making.

3. **Dynamic Threshold**: Establish an adaptive threshold for cooperation based on:
   - Current stock level: Higher thresholds when stock is robust.
   - Remaining rounds: Lower thresholds as the game progresses, especially in later rounds.
   - Others' cooperation rates: Adjust threshold to encourage reciprocal behavior.

4. **Decision Rule**:
   - Cooperate if the observed cooperation rate exceeds the threshold.
   - Defect otherwise, particularly if others are defecting or stock is low.

5. **Stock Dynamics Adjustment**: Lower cooperation thresholds when the stock is low to prevent further depletion and allow for recovery.

6. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final few rounds, slightly increase defection rates to capitalize on immediate gains, acknowledging the temptation but balancing it with long-term sustainability.

**Edge Cases Handling**:
- **First Round**: Cooperate without history.
- **Low Stock**: Prioritize defecting to prevent depletion.
- **High Stock**: Maintain cooperation to sustain resource levels.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively responding to the game's dynamics and other players' actions. It aims to foster a cooperative equilibrium while remaining robust against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_42 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Thresholds**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 5% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Establish trust and observe others' behavior, encouraging collective cooperation.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitoring Stock Trends:**
     - Track the stock level changes over consecutive rounds.
     - Calculate the percentage change in stock from one round to the next.
   - **Defection Trigger:**
     - If the stock decreases by more than a threshold (e.g., 5%) for three consecutive rounds, defect in the next round.
     - Continue defecting until the stock shows consistent growth above another threshold (e.g., 3% increase).
   - **Rationale:** Respond to sustained defection trends while preventing over-reaction to minor fluctuations.

3. **Last 10% of Rounds:**
   - **Adjustment:** Use a more lenient trigger for defection, focusing on maximizing immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.
   - **Rationale:** Prioritize short-term gains in the final rounds when there's no future retaliation to consider.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to build trust and set a positive precedent.
- **Last Round:** If beneficial, defect to maximize payoff without concern for future consequences.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Continue cooperating as the stock is stable or growing.
- **Very Low Stock Levels:** Defect if necessary but aim to signal others to cooperate through consistent behavior.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```
for each round t in 1..r:
    if t <= initial_rounds (first 5%):
        action = C
    else:
        calculate stock change from previous rounds
        if sustained decrease > threshold for last x rounds:
            action = D
        elif sustained increase > threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            maintain previous action or default to C

    handle_last_10_percent():
        adjust thresholds towards higher defection likelihood
```

This strategy balances cooperation with adaptive responses to defection, ensuring robustness and adaptability across various scenarios.

description_COLLECTIVE_43 = '''
**Collective Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance between cooperation for sustainability and defection when necessary, ensuring adaptability to various opponent behaviors while maximizing collective payoff.

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Few Rounds):**
   - Cooperate in the first round(s) to maintain a high stock level, promoting sustainable future gains.

2. **Monitor Stock Trends:**
   - Track whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable over recent rounds.
   - If the stock has decreased in each of the last k rounds (e.g., 3), switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoff and prevent further depletion.

3. **Endgame Defection (Last l Rounds):**
   - In the final l rounds (e.g., 10% of total rounds), always defect to secure maximum short-term gains as future payoffs are negligible.

4. **Critical Stock Level Check:**
   - If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), immediately switch to defecting, as growth is minimal and others are likely doing the same.

### **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set initial thresholds (high = 80%, low = 20%) based on capacity.
   - Determine l (e.g., last 10% of rounds) for endgame defection.
   - Choose k (e.g., 3) for trend analysis.

2. **Round-by-Round Execution:**
   - For each round:
     - If in the final l rounds, defect.
     - Else if stock < low threshold, defect.
     - Else if stock > high threshold and stable/increasing, cooperate.
     - Else, check recent trends; defect if stock is decreasing.

3. **Adaptation:**
   - Adjust thresholds or k based on observed behavior to optimize responsiveness without over-reacting.

### **Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
threshold_low = 0.2 * capacity
l = int(0.1 * r)  # last 10% rounds
k = 3  # trend analysis window

for t in range(r):
    if t >= (r - l):
        play D
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        if current_stock < threshold_low:
            play D
        elif current_stock > threshold_high:
            play C
        else:
            recent_stocks = get_last_k_rounds(k)
            if is_decreasing(recent_stocks):
                play D
            else:
                play C
    update_recent_history(current_stock)
```

### **Conclusion:**

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection, ensuring sustainable gains while responding to stock trends and nearing the game's end. It handles edge cases effectively, promoting both collective interest and individual payoff optimization.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_44 = '''
**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to encourage reciprocal cooperation and sustain the resource.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     1. Assess if more than a certain percentage of players (e.g., 70%) cooperated in the previous round.
     2. Check if the current stock level exceeds 75% of the capacity.
     3. If both conditions are satisfied, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Apply the same decision rules but consider that defecting might lead to depletion. Aim to cooperate if others did to maximize collective payoff despite no future rounds.
   - **High Stock (near capacity):** Strongly encourage cooperation for sustainability and growth.
   - **Low Stock:** More likely to Defect, as the resource is strained, balancing immediate gain with long-term risk.

3. **Rationale:**
   - Promotes cooperation when sustainable and reciprocal, ensuring resource replenishment.
   - Adapts to defection by others or low stock, preventing exploitation and potential collapse of the common pool.

This strategy balances individual payoffs with collective sustainability, dynamically adjusting based on observed behavior and resource state.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_45 = '''
To address the problem, we need an adaptive strategy that balances individual gain with the sustainability of the shared resource. The strategy should consider both the current state of the stock and the historical behavior of other players.

### Approach
The approach involves a decision rule based on two key factors:
1. **Current Stock Level**: If the stock is above a certain threshold, it indicates sustainability, prompting cooperation.
2. **Recent Cooperation Rates**: Observing whether most players have been cooperating in recent rounds helps maintain the social contract to sustain the resource.

The strategy dynamically adjusts:
- **Cooperate** if the stock is sufficiently high and recent cooperation rates are strong.
- **Defect** if the stock drops below a threshold or cooperation rates weaken, signaling potential over-depletion.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(stock, history, n_players, capacity):
    # Parameters can be adjusted based on testing
    threshold_stock = 0.6 * capacity
    recent_rounds = 3
    cooperation_threshold = 0.7
    
    if stock >= capacity:
        return 'C'
    
    if len(history) < recent_rounds:
        # Not enough history, default to Cooperate in early rounds
        return 'C'
    
    recent_cooperations = sum([sum(round_actions) for round_actions in history[-recent_rounds:]])
    total_possible = n_players * recent_rounds
    recent_coop_rate = recent_cooperations / total_possible
    
    if stock > threshold_stock and recent_coop_rate > cooperation_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Rounds**: Start by cooperating to build a sustainable resource base.
- **Stock Check**: If the stock is high, continue cooperation to maximize long-term gains.
- **Cooperation Trend**: By monitoring recent cooperation rates, the strategy ensures that actions align with collective efforts to sustain the resource.
- **Adaptive Defection**: If the stock drops or cooperation wanes, defecting helps prevent further depletion and signals others to reconsider their strategies.

This approach balances individual gain with the sustainability of the shared resource, fostering a cooperative environment while being adaptable to changing conditions.

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoffs while maintaining sustainable resource levels through adaptive cooperation and defection.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate (C) vs Defect (D)**

#### **General Approach:**
- The strategy balances self-interest with collective sustainability by adapting actions based on the observed behavior of other players and the current state of the common pool resource.
- Players start by cooperating, then adapt their strategies dynamically in subsequent rounds.

---

#### **Key Decision Factors:**

1. **Current Stock Level (S):**
   - **High Stock (S > 80% of capacity):** Cooperate to sustain long-term resource availability.
     - Rationale: High stock levels can tolerate some consumption while maintaining sustainability.
   - **Medium Stock (40% < S ≤ 80% of capacity):** Cooperate if most other players are cooperating; otherwise, defect.
     - Rationale: Medium stock requires careful management to prevent over-depletion. If others are not cooperating, defecting can maximize individual gains while protecting against exploitation.
   - **Low Stock (S ≤ 40% of capacity):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
     - Rationale: Low stock levels indicate that the resource is under significant stress. Cooperating would result in minimal payoff, and defecting allows players to capture as much value as possible before the resource collapses.

2. **Recent Cooperation Rate (Coop_Rate):**
   - Calculate the proportion of cooperations observed in the last 3 rounds.
   - **High Coop_Rate (>70%):** Cooperate to maintain cooperation and sustain the resource.
     - Rationale: If most players are cooperating, continuing to cooperate helps preserve the resource for future gains.
   - **Low Coop_Rate (≤70%):** Defect to maximize individual payoff while minimizing losses from others' defection.
     - Rationale: If many players are defecting, cooperating would result in being exploited. Defecting allows players to capture more value before the resource is depleted.

3. **Round Number (t):**
   - **First Round (t = 1):** Cooperate to encourage other players to cooperate and start the game sustainably.
     - Rationale: Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent and may encourage others to follow suit.
   - **Middle Rounds (2 ≤ t ≤ r-2):** Use the above factors (stock level and recent cooperation rate) to decide between cooperating or defecting.
     - Rationale: The middle rounds are critical for balancing immediate gains and long-term sustainability.
   - **Last Two Rounds (t = r-1, r):** Defect to maximize individual payoff in the final rounds.
     - Rationale: In the last few rounds, there is no future punishment for overusing the resource. Therefore, defecting allows players to capture as much value as possible.

4. **Stock Growth Potential (Growth_Potential):**
   - Calculate the potential growth of the stock after consumption.
   - If the stock has high growth potential, cooperate to sustain the resource.
     - Rationale: High growth potential indicates that the resource can recover quickly, making cooperation beneficial in the long run.
   - If the stock has low growth potential, defect to maximize immediate payoff.
     - Rationale: Low growth potential means that the resource cannot recover quickly, so defecting allows players to capture as much value as possible before the resource collapses.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling**

1. **First Round (t = 1):**
   - Always Cooperate.
   - Rationale: Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent and may encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Last Two Rounds (t = r-1, r):**
   - Always Defect.
   - Rationale: In the last few rounds, there is no future punishment for overusing the resource. Therefore, defecting allows players to capture as much value as possible.

3. **Stock Near Capacity or Low Levels:**
   - If the stock is near capacity (S > 80% of capacity), Cooperate.
     - Rationale: High stock levels can tolerate some consumption while maintaining sustainability.
   - If the stock is low (S ≤ 40% of capacity), Defect.
     - Rationale: Low stock levels indicate that the resource is under significant stress. Cooperating would result in minimal payoff, and defecting allows players to capture as much value as possible before the resource collapses.

---

### **3. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, n, t, history):
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate
    coop_rate = calculate_coop_rate(history)
    
    # Determine stock level category
    if stock > 0.8 * capacity:
        stock_category = "high"
    elif 0.4 * capacity < stock <= 0.8 * capacity:
        stock_category = "medium"
    else:
        stock_category = "low"
    
    # Calculate growth potential
    remaining_stock = stock - total_consumption
    growth_potential = 2 * remaining_stock * (1 - remaining_stock / capacity)
    
    # Decision rules
    if t == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif t >= r - 1:  # Last two rounds
        return "D"  # Defect to maximize payoff
    else:
        if stock_category == "high":
            return "C"
        elif stock_category == "medium":
            if coop_rate > 0.7:  # If most players are cooperating
                return "C"
            else:
                return "D"
        else:  # stock is low
            return "D"
```

---

### **4. Collective Mindset Alignment**

- The strategy aligns with a collective mindset of balancing self-interest with the sustainability of the common pool resource.
- By starting with cooperation and adapting based on others' behavior, players contribute to maintaining a sustainable resource while protecting themselves from exploitation.
- The focus is on long-term gains over short-term maximization, ensuring that the resource remains available for future rounds.

---

### **5. Robustness to Opponent Behaviors**

- The strategy is robust because it dynamically adapts to changes in opponents' behavior.
- If opponents cooperate, the strategy continues to cooperate, fostering a cooperative environment.
- If opponents defect, the strategy defects in response, preventing exploitation and maximizing individual payoff.

---

### **6. Summary of Decision Rules**

1. **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage cooperation and start sustainably.
2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Cooperate if the stock is high (>80% capacity) or if most players are cooperating (coop_rate > 70%).
   - Defect if the stock is low (≤40% capacity) or if many players are defecting ( coop_rate ≤ 70%).
3. **Last Two Rounds:** Defect to maximize individual payoff in the final rounds.

---

This strategy balances self-interest with collective sustainability, adapting dynamically to changes in opponents' behavior and resource levels. It is designed to perform well in tournaments against a wide range of opponent strategies, ensuring both individual success and sustainable resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_47 = '''
To address the problem, we'll implement a strategy that balances immediate payoffs with future considerations. The approach uses an adaptive threshold based on the current round number, encouraging cooperation when the resource is abundant and switching to defection as the game progresses or the resource depletes.

**Strategy Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to maintain the resource.
2. **Threshold Calculation:** Dynamically adjust the threshold for cooperation based on how far into the game we are. The threshold decreases linearly from 80% of capacity in the first round to 50% in the final round, allowing more defection as the game progresses.
3. **Action Decision:** If the current stock is above the calculated threshold, cooperate; otherwise, defect. In the last few rounds, always defect to maximize immediate gains.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, capacity):
    if total_rounds == 0:
        return 'C'  # Edge case, though unlikely
    
    # Calculate progress through the game (0 for first round, 1 for last)
    progress = (round_number - 1) / (total_rounds - 1) if total_rounds > 1 else 0
    threshold = 0.8 - progress * 0.3  # Threshold decreases from 80% to 50%
    
    # In the last few rounds, always defect regardless of stock
    if round_number >= total_rounds - 2:
        return 'D'
    
    if current_stock >= threshold * capacity:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Answer:**

To implement this strategy effectively, use the following decision rule:

If it's one of the last two rounds or the current stock is below a dynamically adjusted threshold (starting at 80% and decreasing to 50%), defect; otherwise, cooperate.

The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Defect if in last two rounds or current stock < dynamically decreasing threshold; else cooperate}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_48 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer**

The optimal strategy for managing the common pool resource involves balancing immediate gains with sustainability. Here's how to approach it:

1. **Assess Current Stock Level**: Each player observes the current stock level of the common pool.

2. **Determine Threshold**: Establish a threshold at half of the capacity (50%). This point is chosen because it allows for maximum regrowth when all players cooperate, ensuring sustainability.

3. **Decision Rule**:
   - **Cooperate if Current Stock > 50% Capacity**: By cooperating, players contribute to maintaining the stock level, enabling growth and sustainable future payoffs.
   - **Defect if Current Stock ≤ 50% Capacity**: If the stock is low or has dropped below half capacity, defecting allows players to capture remaining resources before potential collapse.

4. **Rationale**:
   - Cooperating when the stock is high ensures that after consumption, enough remains to regrow sustainably.
   - Defecting when the stock is low prevents over-depletion and allows capturing whatever resources remain, preventing a total collapse where future payoffs would be zero.

5. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - **High Stock (e.g., 100)**: All players cooperate, leading to moderate consumption and maximum regrowth, maintaining the stock.
   - **Moderate Stock (e.g., 62.5)**: Cooperating allows partial consumption with enough left for significant growth.
   - **Low Stock (e.g., 34.375)**: Defecting captures remaining resources, preventing further decline.

**Final Answer**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate when the current stock of the common pool exceeds half of its capacity and defect otherwise. This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring that the resource remains viable for future rounds.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock > 50% of capacity; else, Defect}}

**Final Answer**

Here is the strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game:

---

### **Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment**

This strategy focuses on maintaining a balance between cooperation and defecting, adapting based on stock health, past payoffs, and opponents' actions.

#### **Decision Rules**

1. **First Round (t=1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Justification: Starting with cooperation helps maintain a healthy stock level, encouraging others to cooperate as well.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
   Players decide whether to Cooperate or Defect based on the following factors:

   - **Stock Health Check:**
     - Calculate the current stock as a percentage of capacity.
     - If `stock >= 75% * capacity`:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - Justification: High stock indicates sustainable resources; cooperation maintains this balance.
     - Else if `50% * capacity <= stock < 75% * capacity`:
       - **Action:** Cooperate, but monitor opponents' actions for potential punishment in future rounds.
         - Justification: Moderate stock suggests cautious cooperation while preparing to respond to defection.
     - If `stock < 50% * capacity`:
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - Justification: Low stock indicates over-depletion; defecting maximizes immediate gain before potential collapse.

   - **Past Payoff Analysis:**
     - Calculate the average payoff per round for cooperation vs. defection.
     - If past payoffs from cooperating are significantly lower than defecting:
       - **Action:** Defect this round to signal dissatisfaction with others' behavior.
         - Justification: Encourages others to cooperate in future rounds to avoid punishment.

   - **Opponents' Actions (Punishment Mechanism):**
     - If more than 50% of players defected in the previous round:
       - **Action:** Defect this round.
         - Justification: Punish defection by reducing others' payoffs and signaling disapproval.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate or follow the Stock Health Check.

3. **Last Round (t = r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Justification: Since there's no future payoff, defecting maximizes immediate gain regardless of stock level.

#### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent and encourage others to follow suit.

- **Last Round:**
  - Always Defect to maximize individual payoff since future rounds are irrelevant.

- **Low Stock Levels (stock < capacity/2):**
  - Switch to defecting to prevent further over-depletion and signal the need for change in behavior.

#### **Collective Mindset Alignment**

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset of:

1. **Sustainability:**
   - Players cooperate when resources are abundant, ensuring long-term benefits for all.
   
2. **Punishment:**
   - When cooperation is not reciprocated (e.g., others defect), players switch to defecting to incentivize better behavior in future rounds.

3. **Adaptability:**
   - The strategy adapts dynamically based on the current state of the game and past interactions, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

#### **Pseudocode**

```python
def decide_action(player_i, history, stock, capacity):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    t = current_round()

    if t == 1:
        return 'C'  # First round: Cooperate

    elif t == r:
        return 'D'  # Last round: Defect

    else:
        # Check stock health
        stock_health = (stock / capacity) * 100

        # Calculate past payoffs for C and D
        payoff_C = sum([history[t][player_i] for t in history if history[t][player_i].action == 'C']) / len([t for t in history if history[t][player_i].action == 'C'])
        payoff_D = sum([history[t][player_i] for t in history if history[t][player_i].action == 'D']) / len([t for t in history if history[t][player_i].action == 'D'])

        # Determine opponents' actions in the previous round
        prev_actions = [history[t-1][i] for i in range(n)]
        percent_defected_prev = sum(1 for a in prev_actions if a == 'D') / n

```

### **Explanation**

- The strategy starts by Cooperating to establish a cooperative baseline.
- It adapts based on the current stock level, past payoffs, and opponents' actions.
- Punishes defection by defecting in response when more than half of players have defected previously.
- Maximizes immediate gains in the last round by defecting.

This approach balances individual self-interest with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation while deterring excessive defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_50 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative Strategy (ACS)

**Objective:** To maximize long-term payoffs by maintaining sustainable consumption of the common pool resource through adaptive cooperation and controlled defection.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Rationale: Start with full cooperation to establish a stable stock level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1:** Monitor historical cooperation rate from previous rounds.
   - **Step 2:** Check current stock level against predefined thresholds:
     - **High Stock Threshold (HST):** Stock ≥ capacity * 0.8
     - **Low Stock Threshold (LST):** Stock ≤ capacity * 0.3
   - **Step 3:**
     - If historical cooperation rate > 75% and stock is above HST:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Else if historical cooperation rate < 50% or stock drops below LST:
       - **Action:** Defect (punitive phase)
     - Else:
       - Maintain current strategy based on previous round's action.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Rationale: Ensure sustainability for potential future rounds, though in this case, it reinforces the cooperative mindset without penalizing for endgame effects.

---

### **Adaptation and Punishment Mechanism:**

- **Punitive Phase:**
  - If defection is detected (cooperation rate < 50%) or stock falls below LST:
    - Defect for up to 3 consecutive rounds to signal the need for change.
  - After punitive phase, reassess cooperation rate and stock level.

- **Forgiveness:**
  - If during punitive phase, cooperation rate rebounds above 60% and stock rises above HST:
    - Revert to Cooperate in subsequent rounds.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent and maximize initial payoff without depleting resources.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Cooperate to maintain sustainable practices, even though it's the final round, promoting long-term resource health.

3. **Stock Depletion (Stock = 0):**
   - If stock reaches zero, defect in subsequent rounds until cooperation is re-established and stock begins to recover.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def ACS_strategy(current_round, historical_coop_rate, current_stock):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        HST = capacity * 0.8
        LST = capacity * 0.3
        
        if historical_coop_rate > 0.75 and current_stock >= HST:
            return "C"
        elif historical_coop_rate < 0.5 or current_stock <= LST:
            return "D"
        else:
            # Continue previous action
            return last_action

def update_state():
    global historical_coop_rate, last_action
    # Calculate new cooperation rate based on latest round
    # Adjust last_action based on ACS_strategy output
```

---

### **Rationale:**

- **Sustainability:** Prioritizes maintaining the stock above HST to ensure regeneration and long-term viability.
- **Adaptability:** Responds dynamically to changes in player behavior, encouraging cooperation while deterring excessive defection through punitive measures.
- **Collective Mindset:** Aligns individual actions with collective goals by balancing immediate gains against future sustainability.

This strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment while being resilient to exploitation, ensuring the common pool resource remains healthy over multiple rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_51 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Retaliation**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale:** Establish a sustainable resource base and signal the value of cooperation.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 60% of total rounds):**
   - **Monitoring:** Track the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If the proportion of Cooperators is above 60%, continue to Cooperate.
     - If below 60%, Defect (D) to apply pressure and encourage others to cooperate again.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Allow more defection as the game nears its end, balancing immediate gains with minimal concern for future consequences.
   - **Rationale:** Capitalize on remaining resources without over-depleting them, considering the game will soon conclude.

4. **Stock Health Check:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level relative to capacity.
   - If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, prioritize Cooperating in the next round(s) to rebuild it, regardless of past cooperation rates.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Increase defection as there's no future payoff beyond these rounds.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```
Initialize: cooperate in the first round

for each round from 1 to r:
    if current_round is initial rounds (first 20%):
        action = C
    else:
        calculate proportion_coop_prev_round
        check stock_level
        
        if stock_level < 50% of capacity:
            action = C
        elif proportion_coop_prev_round > 60%:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D

    # Update history for next round's decision
    record_action(action)
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to collective behavior and resource levels, encouraging cooperation while applying pressure when defection becomes prevalent.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_52 = '''
To address the problem, we need a strategy that balances between maintaining sustainable consumption and maximizing immediate gains, especially towards the end of the game. The strategy should be robust against various opponent behaviors and rely on observable state rather than specific players' strategies.

### Approach
The proposed approach is based on two main observations:
1. **Sustainability Threshold**: To maintain sustainability, it's ideal to keep the stock around half of its capacity (capacity/2). This level allows for optimal growth while preventing over-consumption.
2. **End Game Adjustment**: Near the end of the game, players might be incentivized to defect more to maximize their immediate gains, knowing that the game will end soon.

The strategy is as follows:
1. **Initial and Mid Game Rounds**:
   - Cooperate if the current stock level is above half of its capacity (capacity/2).
   - Defect otherwise.
2. **End Game Adjustment**: In the last 10% of rounds, always defect to maximize immediate payoffs.

This approach ensures that we maintain sustainable consumption levels while adapting to near-end game dynamics where maximizing gains becomes more critical.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    # Check if it's the end game (last 10% of rounds)
    if round_number > 0.9 * total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate the sustainable threshold
    capacity = history[0]['stock']  # Assuming initial stock is full capacity
    sustainable_threshold = capacity / 2
    
    # Decide based on current stock level relative to threshold
    if current_stock >= sustainable_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **End Game Handling**: The strategy switches to always defecting in the last 10% of rounds to capitalize on remaining resources without regard for future sustainability, as there are no future rounds left.
- **Sustainability Check**: By maintaining a target stock level (half of capacity), the strategy ensures that consumption remains sustainable, promoting growth and preventing resource depletion.
- **Adaptability**: The approach dynamically adjusts based on the current stock level, responding to others' behaviors without requiring explicit knowledge of their strategies.

This solution effectively balances between short-term gains and long-term sustainability, making it robust against various playing styles while adhering to observable game states.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_53 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Cooperation Strategy**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a positive baseline for stock growth.

2. **Monitor and Adapt**: Continuously observe the current stock level and the proportion of cooperative actions from all players in recent rounds.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - **Stock Threshold**: Cooperate if the current stock is above 70% of capacity.
   - **Cooperation Rate**: Require at least 50% cooperation among players in the last few rounds to continue cooperating.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Adjust thresholds dynamically based on round number, lowering the stock threshold in later rounds when future impact is less significant.

5. **Reversion Mechanism**: If high defection leads to low stock levels, revert to cooperation to aid replenishment, even if it slightly reduces immediate payoffs.

6. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%), allow a tendency towards defecting since preserving the stock is less critical.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to prevent over-depletion and encouraging cooperation when beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_54 = '''
The AC (Adaptive Cooperation) strategy is designed to balance immediate payoffs with long-term resource sustainability through a combination of cooperation and defection based on current conditions and recent behavior.

**Strategy Description:**

1. **First Round**: Always cooperate to encourage others to follow suit, setting a cooperative precedent.

2. **Middle Rounds**: 
   - If the current stock is above 70% of capacity and at least half of other players have cooperated recently, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock is low (below 70%) or more than half of recent interactions involved defection, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Last Round**: Always defect since there are no future consequences, allowing each player to maximize their final payoff.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, history):
    capacity = 100  # Replace with actual capacity value
    n = 4           # Number of players; adjust as needed
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:  # Assuming 'r' is the total number of rounds
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > 0.7 * capacity:
            recent_coop = sum(1 for action in history[-k:] if action == 'C')
            if recent_coop >= (n - 1) / 2:  # At least half of others cooperated
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            recent_defect = sum(1 for action in history[-k:] if action == 'D')
            if recent_defect > (n - 1) / 2:  # More than half defected
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
```

**Explanation of the Pseudocode:**

- **Initial Round**: Cooperates to set a cooperative tone.
- **Middle Rounds**: Adapts based on stock levels and recent interactions. Maintains cooperation when conditions are favorable and defects when necessary.
- **Final Round**: Defects to maximize individual payoff without worrying about future rounds.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adjusting dynamically to changing conditions and the behavior of other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_55 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive and robust strategy that considers the current stock level, historical cooperation rates, and game progression. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round Behavior**: Cooperate to establish a sustainable resource base.
2. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - **High Stock (Above 75% of Capacity)**: Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - **Mid-Range Stock (25%-75%)**: Adjust based on recent cooperation rates.
   - **Low Stock (Below 25%)**: Defect to prevent further depletion and signal the need for change.
3. **Recent Cooperation Rate**: Use a moving average of past cooperation rates to decide actions in mid-range stock scenarios.
4. **Endgame Adjustment**: Increase tendency to cooperate in the last few rounds to maintain resource sustainability.

### Detailed Strategy

#### 1. Initialization
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintain records of each player's actions (C/D) over previous rounds.
- **Thresholds**: Define high and low thresholds relative to capacity (e.g., high = 0.75*capacity, low = 0.25*capacity).

#### 2. Round-by-Round Decision Making

**First Round:**
- Action: Cooperate (C)
- Rationale: Preserves the resource for future rounds and encourages others to do the same.

**Subsequent Rounds:**

- **Current Stock Check**:
  - If stock > high_threshold: Cooperate.
  - If stock < low_threshold: Defect.
  - Else (mid-range): Assess recent cooperation rates.

- **Mid-Range Handling**:
  - Calculate the moving average of cooperation rates over the last k rounds (e.g., k=3).
  - If average cooperation > 70%: Cooperate.
  - Else: Defect.

**Endgame Adjustment:**
- In the final 10% of rounds, increase tendency to cooperate to prevent stock depletion and sustain growth.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
initialize historical_cooperation = []
threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity
k = 3  # Number of recent rounds considered for cooperation rate

for t in range(1, r + 1):
    if t == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock(t-1)
        if current_stock > threshold_high:
            action = 'C'
        elif current_stock < threshold_low:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            # Mid-range, check recent cooperation
            recent_coop = average(historical_cooperation[-k:])
            if recent_coop > 0.7:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'
    record_action(action)
    historical_cooperation.append(1 if action == 'C' else 0)

# For the last few rounds, adjust to prevent depletion
if t >= r - (r // 10):
    action = 'C'
```

### Edge Cases and Considerations

- **First Round**: Default cooperation to build trust.
- **Low Stock**: Defecting signals others of the crisis, potentially encouraging future cooperation.
- **Endgame**: Cooperate more to maintain stock for any potential post-game scenarios.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to both resource levels and player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_56 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we'll employ a strategy that prioritizes sustainability by monitoring the stock's health and trends. The strategy adapts based on the remaining stock level and its trajectory, encouraging cooperation when resources are plentiful and defecting when they're overused.

### Strategy: Adaptive Stock-Based Cooperation (ASBC)

**1. Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Allow the stock to remain high, encouraging others to cooperate as well.

**2. Monitor Stock Trends:**
   - Track the stock level over a window of past rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds) to determine if it's increasing, decreasing, or stable.
   - Calculate the average change in stock to smooth out short-term fluctuations.

**3. Decision Rule Based on Stock Trend and Level:**
   - **Cooperate Conditions:**
     - If the stock is above a dynamic threshold (initially 80% of capacity) and increasing or stable.
   - **Defect Conditions:**
     - If the stock falls below the threshold or shows a significant decrease over time.

**4. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Adjust the threshold based on remaining rounds, becoming more lenient in later stages to maximize immediate payoff without reckless depletion.

**5. Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate with no history.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 3):** Cooperate only if stock is above a high threshold (90% of capacity). Otherwise, defect to maximize payoff.

### Summary:

The ASBC strategy emphasizes sustainability by responding to the stock's health. It encourages cooperation when resources are abundant and switches to defection when overuse threatens depletion. This adaptive approach balances immediate gains with long-term resource preservation, ensuring robust performance across varying game dynamics.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_57 = '''
The proposed strategy is designed to balance cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection to maximize immediate gains when necessary. Here's a structured outline of the strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Conditional Cooperation (ACC)

1. **Initial Round Decision**:
   - Cooperate in the first round to encourage others to maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Recent Behavior**: Examine the number of defectors in the last m rounds (e.g., m=2). This provides insight into recent trends.
   - **Threshold for Defection**: If the proportion of defectors exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%), defect in the current round. Otherwise, cooperate.
   - **Stock Level Consideration**: Adjust behavior based on the current stock level relative to capacity:
     - If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., half of capacity), prioritize cooperation to sustain growth.
     - If below this threshold, consider defecting more often to maximize immediate payoff before potential crash.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - The defection threshold and stock level thresholds can be adjusted dynamically based on game parameters (n, capacity) to optimize performance across different scenarios.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Default to cooperation.
   - **Last Round**: Consider defecting to maximize immediate payoff, but weigh this against the potential collective crash if too many defect.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, capacity):
    # Initial round: cooperate
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Recent behavior analysis
    recent_rounds = min(2, len(history))
    num_defectors = sum(round_data.count('D') for round_data in history[-recent_rounds:])
    prop_defectors = num_defectors / (n * recent_rounds)
    
    # Stock level check
    if current_stock < capacity * 0.5:
        return 'D'
    
    # Decision based on defector proportion
    if prop_defectors > 0.3:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# Example usage over rounds
action = decide_action(history, stock, capacity)
```

### Summary

This strategy encourages cooperation when the stock is healthy and others are cooperating, promoting sustainability. It adapts by defecting when necessary to prevent exploitation or in response to low stock levels, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term resource management. The approach is robust, dynamically adjusting thresholds based on game parameters and recent behavior, making it effective against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_58 = '''
To address the problem of ensuring sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a strategy where each player's decision is based on the current stock level relative to predefined thresholds. Here's the step-by-step explanation and solution:

### Step 1: Define Thresholds
- **T_high (Upper Threshold):** Set at 80% of capacity. Players will Cooperate when the stock exceeds this threshold.
- **T_low (Lower Threshold):** Although not explicitly required, recognizing that below T_high might still sustain cooperation with some adjustments.

### Step 2: Decision Rule
Each player independently decides to:
- **Cooperate** if the current stock is above T_high (80% of capacity).
- **Defect** otherwise.

### Step 3: Strategy Implementation
By following this rule, players ensure that as long as the resource remains sufficiently abundant (above 80%), cooperation continues, maintaining the equilibrium. If the stock drops below this threshold due to Defectors, others switch to Defecting, potentially leading to rapid depletion but allowing adaptation based on the new state.

### Solution Code
While the strategy is conceptual and doesn't require code for implementation, a simplified example in pseudocode could illustrate how players make decisions:

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, capacity):
    T_high = 0.8 * capacity
    if stock_level > T_high:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"
```

### Explanation
- **Sustainability:** When the stock is above 80%, all players Cooperate, ensuring the resource replenishes each cycle.
- **Adaptation:** If Defectors cause the stock to drop below 80%, others switch to Defecting, maximizing immediate gains while acknowledging potential resource collapse.

This approach balances individual payoff maximization with sustainability efforts, providing a robust strategy under varying conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_59 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a shared resource while avoiding its depletion, we can employ a strategic approach that balances cooperation with protective measures against over-consumption. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the proposed strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round. This establishes a baseline of trust and sustainability.

2. **Monitor Consumption**: For each subsequent round, monitor the total consumption from the previous round. This involves tracking how much of the resource was used collectively.

3. **Threshold Check**: Determine if the total consumption in the last round exceeded half of the current stock at the start of that round. The rationale is that consuming more than half risks depleting the resource faster and prevents sustainable growth.

4. **Decision to Defect or Cooperate**:
   - If the total consumption was greater than half the current stock, switch to defecting in the next round. This action serves as a safeguard against over-consumption, signaling others to adjust their behavior.
   - If consumption was within acceptable limits (i.e., ≤ half the stock), continue cooperating to maintain resource levels and encourage collective sustainability.

5. **Adaptation**: While this strategy provides a basic framework, it's important for players to remain adaptable. Continuous monitoring and adjustments based on collective behavior can enhance effectiveness.

**Answer**:

The proposed strategy is designed to balance cooperation with protective measures against over-consumption, aiming to sustain the resource. The step-by-step approach is as follows:

1. **Cooperate Initially**: Start with cooperation in the first round to build trust.

2. **Monitor and Evaluate Consumption**: After each round, assess whether total consumption exceeded half of the current stock at the start of that round.

3. **Adjust Behavior Based on Threshold**:
   - If consumption was excessive (greater than half), defect in the next round to signal others.
   - If within limits, continue cooperating to maintain sustainability.

This strategy helps prevent resource depletion while encouraging collective responsibility. The final answer is:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; defect if previous total consumption exceeded half of the current stock, otherwise cooperate.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_60 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Retaliation**

The strategy is designed to promote sustainability by initially cooperating and adapting based on previous rounds' behavior and the current stock level. It aims to balance immediate gains with future sustainability.

---

### **Decision Rules**
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and maintain higher stock levels for future rounds.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** 
   - Calculate the proportion of players who Defected in the previous round (`defectors_prev`).
   - Check if `defectors_prev` exceeds 30% or if the current stock is below 60% of capacity.
     - If either condition is met, switch to Defecting to reduce consumption and encourage others to cooperate again.
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating.

### **Handling Edge Cases**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20% of total rounds):** Prioritize immediate payoff by Defecting more to maximize individual gain in the final stages.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below 60% of capacity, switch to Cooperating to allow regrowth and prevent resource collapse.

### **Collective Mindset**
The strategy emphasizes collective sustainability while allowing for adaptation. Players prioritize cooperation unless excessive defection or low stock levels threaten future viability.

---

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decision(current_round, total_rounds, n, capacity, stock_history, actions_history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    previous_defectors = sum(1 for action in actions_history[-1] if action == 'D')
    defectors_prev = previous_defectors / n
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    
    # Check triggers to defect
    trigger_defect = False
    if defectors_prev > 0.3:
        trigger_defect = True
    if current_stock < 0.6 * capacity:
        trigger_defect = True
    
    # Last few rounds: prioritize immediate payoff
    if current_round >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 5):
        return 'D'
    
    return 'D' if trigger_defect else 'C'
```

---

This strategy balances cooperation for sustainability with adaptive measures to address excessive defection and low stock levels, ensuring a stable resource base while allowing for individual payoff optimization in the final rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_61 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategy that balances encouraging cooperation for sustainable resource management with individual self-interest. The strategy is adaptive and robust, designed to perform well across various scenarios without overfitting specific game parameters.

### Approach
The approach involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Stock Threshold Check**: In subsequent rounds, if the current stock level is below a critical threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), defect to prevent further depletion.
3. **Previous Round's Cooperation Rate**: If the stock level is above the threshold, check the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round. If this proportion exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., 70%), cooperate again; otherwise, defect.

This strategy aims to maintain a healthy resource level by encouraging cooperation when the group is mostly cooperating and defecting when there's insufficient cooperation or the resource is too depleted.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(previous_actions, current_stock):
    # Define thresholds (assuming capacity is 100 for simplicity; adjust as needed)
    Y = 60  # Current stock threshold to consider defecting due to low resources
    X = 0.7 # Minimum proportion of cooperation in the previous round to continue cooperating
    
    if len(previous_actions) == 0:
        return 'C'  # First round: Cooperate
        
    else:
        num_players = len(previous_actions)
        prev_coop = sum(1 for actions in previous_actions.values() if len(actions) > 0 and actions[-1] == 'C') / num_players
        
        # If current_stock is below threshold, defect to prevent further depletion
        if current_stock < Y:
            return 'D'
        
        # Otherwise, check previous cooperation rate
        elif prev_coop >= X:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, the strategy aims to set a positive tone and encourage others to follow suit.
- **Stock Threshold Check**: The critical threshold ensures that if the resource is too depleted, players switch to defecting to prevent further loss. This helps in resetting dynamics or signaling the need for change.
- **Previous Round's Cooperation Rate**: By evaluating the previous round's cooperation rate, the strategy decides whether continuing to cooperate will maintain or improve the resource level. If enough players cooperated before and the stock is sufficient, it continues to cooperate; otherwise, it defects.

This approach provides a balance between group sustainability and individual rationality, making it effective in various game scenarios.

The strategy for maintaining and managing the resource involves balancing cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and the number of remaining rounds. Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same, fostering a cooperative environment that preserves the resource for future rounds.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - **Cooperate Condition**: If the current stock is above 80% of capacity and there are more than a certain number of rounds remaining (e.g., 5), continue Cooperating. This helps maintain a stable resource level.
   - **Defect Conditions**:
     - If the current stock drops below 60% of capacity, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.
     - In the last few rounds (when there are fewer than, say, 5 rounds left), defect regardless of the stock level since preserving it offers no future benefit.

3. **Smooth Transition and Trend Monitoring**: Instead of reacting solely to the current stock level, consider trends over time. Use a moving average or monitor whether the stock is consistently increasing, decreasing, or stable to make more informed decisions.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - In the first round, Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
   - In the last few rounds, defect aggressively since there are no future payoffs to consider.
   - If the stock reaches 0 or is very low, obviously Defect as there's nothing left to preserve.

5. **Collective Adaptation**: Players should infer others' likely actions based on historical trends and adjust their behavior collectively. High cooperation rates encourage continued cooperation, while significant defection may necessitate a switch to defecting to avoid being exploited.

This strategy balances the need for resource preservation with the practical considerations of finite rounds and potential exploitation, aiming for mutual benefit through adaptive behavior.

To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a common-pool resource scenario, we propose a strategic approach based on threshold-based cooperation and defection. Here's the step-by-step explanation and answer:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to maintain the resource at a sustainable level.

2. **Threshold-Based Strategy**:
    - **Upper Threshold (80% of capacity)**: If the current stock is above 80%, Defect. This allows taking advantage of abundant resources while minimizing immediate harm.
    - **Middle Threshold (60% of capacity)**: Between 60% and 80%, Cooperate to preserve the resource for future rounds.
    - **Lower Threshold (50% of capacity)**: Below 50%, Cooperate more aggressively to allow the stock to regrow.

3. **Adjustment Based on Recent Actions**: Monitor others' actions over recent rounds. If a majority have Cooperated, continue Cooperating to encourage mutual sustainability. If most have Defected, consider switching to Defecting but only if the current stock is above 50% to prevent further depletion.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Continuously adjust your strategy based on changes in the stock level and others' behaviors to maintain a balance between immediate gains and long-term resource health.

By following this structured approach, individuals can contribute to sustaining the common-pool resource while still pursuing their self-interest in a manner that prevents rapid depletion.

**Final Answer**

To sustainably manage the resource while balancing self-interest, each player should:

- Cooperate when the stock is below 80% of capacity.
- Defect when the stock exceeds 80%, taking advantage of abundance.
- Monitor others' actions; if most cooperate, continue doing so to foster mutual sustainability.

Thus, the strategy is encapsulated as:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when stock ≤ 80%; otherwise defect, while considering recent cooperation trends.}}$

description_COLLECTIVE_64 = '''
To address the problem of managing a common pool resource sustainably while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a dynamic strategy that adapts based on observed trends in the resource level. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Begin by Cooperating to establish a baseline and observe others' behavior.

2. **Mid-Game Adaptation:**
   - Track the stock level over recent rounds using a moving average.
   - If the average stock is above 60% of capacity, continue Cooperating as it's sustainable.
   - If below, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion and maximize immediate gains.

3. **Late-Game Adjustment:**
   - In the last 20% of rounds, prioritize defecting to capitalize on immediate payoffs without worrying about long-term sustainability.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Use a moving average with exponential weighting to give more importance to recent stock levels.
   - Adjust the threshold (e.g., 60%) based on observed growth rates and depletion trends.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, previous_stock_levels):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    window_size = min(5, round_number - 1)  # Adjust as needed
    recent_stocks = previous_stock_levels[-window_size:]
    
    # Calculate moving average with exponential weights
    weights = [0.5**i for i in range(len(recent_stocks))]
    total_weight = sum(weights)
    weighted_avg = sum(s * w for s, w in zip(recent_stocks, reversed(weights))) / total_weight
    
    capacity = previous_stock_levels[0]  # Assuming initial stock is at capacity
    threshold = capacity * 0.6  # Adjust threshold as needed
    
    if weighted_avg > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Check if in the last few rounds
        if round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 5):
            return 'D'  # Defect more in late game
        else:
            return 'D' if random.random() < 0.7 else 'C'
```

### Key Considerations

- **Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold can be fine-tuned based on empirical results or specific problem constraints.
- **Moving Average Window:** Adjust the window size to balance responsiveness with stability in decisions.
- **Late Game Focus:** Prioritizing defecting in the final rounds helps maximize immediate payoffs, though this may vary depending on remaining rounds.

This strategy dynamically balances between cooperation for sustainability and defection for immediate gains, adapting based on observed trends in resource levels.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_65 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Threshold-Based Cooperation**

1. **Initial Round**: Start by Cooperating (C) in the first round to establish a baseline of sustainability.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation**:
   - After each round, assess the current stock level and its trend relative to capacity.
   - Use two thresholds:
     - **High Threshold (e.g., 80% of Capacity)**: Continue Cooperating if the stock is above this level or stable.
     - **Low Threshold (e.g., 60% of Capacity)**: Switch to Defecting (D) if the stock falls below this threshold, signaling others and preventing further depletion.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - If the stock is decreasing despite cooperation, start defecting to encourage others to reduce consumption.
   - After defecting, monitor the stock's response. If it recovers, revert to Cooperating; otherwise, continue defecting for a few rounds to strengthen the signal.

4. **Trend Analysis**: Use past trends (e.g., moving average of stock levels) to inform decisions. A downward trend may warrant Defecting, while an upward trend supports Cooperating.

5. **Robustness**: The strategy is designed to be robust against varying opponent behaviors, relying on observable game state and history without requiring communication or coordination.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
for each round in 1..r:
    if current_stock > high_threshold (e.g., 0.8 * capacity):
        action = C
    elif current_stock < low_threshold (e.g., 0.6 * capacity):
        action = D
    else:
        # Determine based on trend
        if stock_increasing_over_time():
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    play_action(action)
```

**Explanation**: This strategy balances cooperation for sustainability with defection as a corrective measure when the resource is overexploited. It dynamically adapts to maintain resource levels, encouraging collective responsibility without communication.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_66 = '''
To design an effective and adaptive strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance cooperation with defecting based on the current state of the stock and the historical cooperation rates of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage sustainable use of the resource.
2. **Adaptive Behavior:** In subsequent rounds, decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the cooperation rate from previous rounds and the current stock level.
3. **Defection in Decline:** If many players are defecting (cooperation rate below a threshold) or the stock is low, switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoff.
4. **Final Round Defection:** In the last round, defect regardless of other factors since there's no future impact.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to encourage a sustainable resource pool and observe others' actions in subsequent rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the cooperation rate from previous rounds.
     - Cooperation Rate = (Number of Cooperators in last round) / n
   - **Step 2:** Determine if current stock is above a sustainable threshold (e.g., capacity/2).
     - Sustainable Threshold = capacity * 0.5
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If Cooperation Rate > 60% and Stock >= Sustainable Threshold:
       - Cooperate to maintain the resource pool.
     - Else:
       - Defect to maximize immediate payoff, especially if others are not cooperating.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Rationale:** No future rounds, so defect for maximum payoff regardless of other factors.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, previous_rounds_actions, current_stock, n, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate cooperation rate from last round
        prev_coop = sum(1 for action in previous_rounds_actions[-1] if action == 'C')
        coop_rate = prev_coop / n
        
        sustainable_threshold = capacity * 0.5
        
        if coop_rate > 0.6 and current_stock >= sustainable_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages sustainability by starting with cooperation.
- **Adaptive Behavior:** Adjusts based on others' actions, promoting cooperation when feasible and defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion.
- **Final Round Defection:** Maximizes payoff in the last round without worrying about future impacts.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to different scenarios and opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_67 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Cooperate to encourage a cooperative environment and maintain a high stock level.

2. **Monitor Behavior:**
   - Track the number of players defecting each round to assess overall cooperation trends.

3. **Adjust Strategy Based on Cooperation Rate:**
   - If most players (≥70%) cooperate, continue to cooperate.
   - If a significant portion (e.g., >30%) defect, start increasing defection frequency to prevent exploitation.

4. **Stock Thresholds:**
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 60% of capacity.
   - Defect if the stock falls below 40% to maximize immediate gain before potential depletion.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 2 rounds):** Increase defection likelihood to capitalize on possible resource availability, considering others might defect as well.

6. **Mitigating Flaws:**
   - Occasionally cooperate even if others defect, aiming to reset cooperation and prevent cycles of mutual defection.
   - Use gradual increases in defection based on stock decrease to avoid sudden depletions.

This strategy balances maintaining cooperation when beneficial with defecting when necessary, adapting to others' actions and current stock levels without relying on specific coordination. It aims to maximize payoffs while sustaining the resource pool for future rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_68 = '''
**Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (ACT)**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over all rounds by balancing immediate exploitation with resource preservation.

**Components:**

1. **Initial Round Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players cooperate to establish a cooperative environment and prevent early depletion of the common pool.

2. **Sustainable Stock Threshold (SST):**
   - Define SST as 60% of capacity. This level ensures that resource recovery is feasible without drastic reductions in payoffs.

3. **Stock Level-Based Action:**
   - **Above SST:** Players cooperate to maintain a stable stock, allowing growth and sustainable use.
   - **Below SST:** Players defect cautiously. If the majority cooperated last round, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect to encourage others to preserve resources.

4. **Tit-for-Tat Component:**
   - After the first round, each player's action is based on the majority action of all players in the previous round.
     - If most players cooperated, continue cooperation.
     - If a significant number defected, defect in this round to signal disapproval and encourage future cooperation.

5. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds (rounded up), enforce cooperation to maximize sustainable payoff as there's limited time for resource recovery.

**Decision Rules:**

- **If current stock > SST:**
  - Cooperate, regardless of previous actions, to maintain sustainability and encourage mutual benefits.

- **If current stock ≤ SST:**
  - Defect if more than half the players defected in the last round.
  - Cooperate otherwise, signaling willingness to preserve resources.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to set a cooperative precedent.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Shift towards cooperation to sustain payoffs without depletion risks.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Maintain cooperation to prevent unnecessary depletion and ensure growth opportunities.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Determine SST as 0.6 * capacity.
   - Start with cooperation in the first round.

2. **Each Round (from 2nd onwards):**
   a. Check if current stock > SST:
      - Cooperate.
   b. Else, check majority action from last round:
      - If more than half cooperated, cooperate.
      - Otherwise, defect to incentivize future cooperation.

3. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - In the final 10% of rounds, enforce cooperation regardless of previous actions.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
function decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if stock_level > SST:
            return 'C'
        else:
            last_round_actions = history[-1]
            majority_coop = sum(last_round_actions) / len(last_round_actions) > 0.5
            if majority_coop:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
    # For final rounds, override with cooperation
    if round_number in last_10_percent:
        return 'C'
```

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages others to preserve resources early on.
- **Stock-Based Decisions:** Balances exploitation and preservation based on current resource levels.
- **Tit-for-Tat Mechanism:** Rewards cooperation and punishes defection, promoting mutual interest in sustainability.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment:** Ensures maximum payoff by maintaining cooperation when future rounds are limited.

This strategy adaptively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging collective cooperation while deterring exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_69 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining sustainability in a common resource game while preventing over-exploitation, we propose a strategic approach that balances cooperation with responsive measures against over-consumption. This strategy ensures long-term benefits by encouraging sustainable use unless disrupted by excessive consumption.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start each round by Cooperating to sustain the resource at its maximum level, ensuring steady payoffs for all players.

2. **Monitor Consumption:** After each round, evaluate the total consumption relative to the initial stock of that round. Specifically, check if the total consumption exceeded half of the initial stock (i.e., C/S > 0.5).

3. **Responsive Defection:** If over-consumption (C/S > 0.5) is detected in any round, switch to Defecting in subsequent rounds. This action aims to maximize immediate gains while signaling不满 at unsustainable practices.

4. **Reversion to Cooperation:** Continue Cooperating only if previous rounds consistently show sustainable consumption (C/S ≤ 0.5). If over-consumption recurs, repeat the defection phase to prevent resource depletion.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to initially Cooperate and maintain sustainability. Upon detecting over-consumption in any round, players should Defect in subsequent rounds to deter further unsustainable practices and maximize immediate payoffs. This approach balances long-term benefits with necessary responsiveness to preserve the resource.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate until over-consumption occurs; then defect in subsequent rounds}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_70 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategy that encourages cooperation while safeguarding against defection and resource depletion. The strategy is designed as follows:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round**: Begin by Cooperating to foster a cooperative environment.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Assess Previous Cooperation**: Determine the proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round(s).
   - **Stock Health Check**: Evaluate if the current stock level is above a sustainable threshold (e.g., 75% capacity).
   - **Decision Making**:
     - If most players Cooperated and the stock is healthy, continue Cooperating.
     - If cooperation levels drop below a threshold or the stock is at risk, switch to Defecting as a punitive measure.
3. **Adaptation**: Adjust thresholds dynamically based on others' actions and stock responses.
4. **Reset Periods**: After periods of Defection, reintroduce Cooperation attempts to encourage positive behavior.

### Detailed Strategy

1. **First Round**:
   - Action: Cooperate
   - Rationale: Set a cooperative tone to encourage others.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round t ≥ 2)**:
   a. **Count Previous Cooperation**:
      - Calculate the number of players who Cooperated in round t-1.
      - If more than half Cooperated and the stock was above 75% capacity, continue Cooperating.

   b. **Stock Check**:
      - If the stock is below a critical level (e.g., 30% capacity), start Defecting aggressively to prevent collapse.

   c. **Recent Trends**:
      - Consider recent rounds (last k rounds) to assess if more than 60% of actions were Defectors.
      - If so, switch to Defecting for the next few rounds.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - After several rounds of Defection, try Cooperating again to test others' responsiveness.
   - Adjust cooperation thresholds based on how the stock responds and others' behavior trends.

4. **Endgame (Last Few Rounds)**:
   - Balance between defecting for remaining resources and maintaining cooperation to sustain higher payoffs longer.

### Conclusion

This strategy aims to promote sustainable cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while monitoring resource health to prevent collapse. It balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability through adaptive behavior and periodic resets to encourage positive actions from others.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_71 = '''
To address the problem of promoting cooperation while adapting to defection in a repeated game scenario, we can outline a strategic approach that balances individual gain with collective sustainability. The strategy takes into account the current stock level, historical cooperation rates among players, and adjusts actions accordingly.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to establish a foundation for sustainability.
2. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - **High Stock (Above 90% Capacity)**: Continue Cooperating to maintain high stock levels.
   - **Moderate Stock (70%-90% Capacity)**: Assess cooperation rates from the previous rounds. If more than 60% of players Cooperated, continue Cooperating; otherwise, switch to Defecting.
   - **Low Stock (Below 70% Capacity)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff as sustainability is at risk.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, previous_actions):
    if current_stock == 0:
        return 'D'
    
    # Determine thresholds based on parameters
    critical_high = 0.9 * capacity
    critical_low = 0.7 * capacity
    
    t = len(previous_actions) + 1
    if t == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate proportion of Cooperators in the last round
    last_round_actions = previous_actions[-1]
    num_coop_last_round = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    total_players = len(last_round_actions)
    proportion_coop_last_round = num_coop_last_round / total_players
    
    # Decision logic based on current stock and cooperation rate
    if current_stock >= critical_high:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock > critical_low:
        if proportion_coop_last_round >= 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with a Cooperate action in the first round to encourage sustainability.
2. **High Stock Levels (Above 90% Capacity)**: When the stock is healthy and high, continuing to Cooperate helps maintain this state, ensuring future rounds also benefit from stable resources.
3. **Moderate Stock Levels (70%-90% Capacity)**: Here, the strategy evaluates recent cooperation rates. If a significant majority of players Cooperated in the last round, it reinforces Cooperation to sustain the resource. Conversely, if Cooperation is low, defecting becomes advantageous to maximize individual payoff while others' defection may indicate an unsustainable trend.
4. **Low Stock Levels (Below 70% Capacity)**: When resources are critically low, defecting is chosen to secure immediate gains before potential collapse.

This approach dynamically adapts based on current conditions and historical behaviors, balancing the need for cooperation with the reality of possible defection to optimize both individual and collective outcomes over time.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_72 = '''
The optimal strategy for maintaining a sustainable balance between consumption and growth is to cooperate when the current stock exceeds half of its maximum capacity. This ensures that each round can sustainably support cooperation without depleting resources beyond recovery.

**Answer:**

Cooperate if the current stock is greater than half of the capacity, otherwise defect.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S > \frac{\text{Capacity}}{2}, \text{ else Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_73 = '''
The proposed collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a structured outline of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
- **Objective:** Maximize individual payoffs while maintaining a sustainable resource level through adaptive cooperation and defection based on game dynamics.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - All players start by Cooperating to establish a high initial stock level, promoting growth in subsequent rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Each player evaluates two factors from the previous round:
     - **Cooperation Rate:** The proportion of players who Cooperated.
     - **Stock Level:** Current stock relative to capacity.

3. **Cooperation Thresholds:**
   - If both the cooperation rate exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 60%) and the current stock is above half of its capacity, players continue to Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, players Defect to either prevent exploitation or manage scarce resources.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(current_round, history, stock, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate cooperation rate in the previous round
        prev_coop_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C')
        coop_rate = prev_coop_count / len(history[-1])
        
        # Determine thresholds
        stock_threshold = capacity * 0.5
        coop_threshold = 0.6
        
        if stock > stock_threshold and coop_rate > coop_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Stock Threshold:** Set at half the capacity to ensure sufficient resources for growth and sustain cooperation.
- **Cooperation Rate Threshold:** 60% ensures a majority are cooperating, promoting collective stability.

This strategy adapts dynamically, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse or exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_74 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff while ensuring sustainable use of the common pool resource through adaptive cooperation, considering both current stock levels and historical behavior of other players.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Cooperate When Safe (High Stock Levels):**
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above 80% of capacity.
   - Rationale: High stock ensures sustainability and sufficient resource for growth, allowing all players to benefit equally without over-depletion.

2. **Defect When Critical (Low Stock Levels):**
   - Defect if the current stock drops below 50% of capacity.
   - Rationale: Low stock indicates potential collapse; defecting allows players to salvage remaining resources before irreversible depletion.

3. **Adapt Based on Others' Behavior:**
   - Cooperate if at least 70% of other players cooperated in the previous round, adjusting thresholds dynamically based on observed cooperation rates.
   - Defect if fewer than 30% of others cooperate, signaling widespread exploitation that necessitates individual gain.

4. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a cooperative tone and encourage others to do the same.
   - **Last Two Rounds (R-1 and R):** Defect in all rounds to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future depletion, given no subsequent rounds.

---

### **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initial Round Strategy:**
   - Cooperate unconditionally in the first round to set a cooperative precedent.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation:**
   - After each round, calculate the proportion of players who cooperated.
   - Adjust cooperation thresholds dynamically based on this proportion:
     - If cooperation rate > 70%, maintain or increase cooperation.
     - If cooperation rate < 30%, shift towards defecting to prevent exploitation.

3. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - Use fixed thresholds (80% for cooperate, 50% for defect) as primary decision criteria.
   - Apply a sliding scale between these thresholds based on observed stock trends and historical cooperation rates.

4. **Final Rounds Strategy:**
   - In the last two rounds, default to defecting to maximize individual payoffs without regard for future resource sustainability.

---

### **Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, round_number, total_rounds, other_players_actions):
    capacity = game_parameters.capacity
    cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(other_players_actions)
    
    # Edge cases handling
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif total_rounds - round_number <= 1:
        return 'D'
    
    # Determine action based on stock level and cooperation rate
    if stock_level > capacity * 0.8:
        return 'C'
    elif stock_level < capacity * 0.5:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if cooperation_rate >= 0.7:
            return 'C'
        elif cooperation_rate <= 0.3:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Use a sliding scale between thresholds
            threshold = capacity * (0.8 - ((capacity - stock_level) / capacity) * 0.3)
            if stock_level > threshold:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

def calculate_cooperation_rate(other_players_actions):
    total_actions = sum(1 for actions in other_players_actions.values() if len(actions) >= round_number and actions[round_number-1] == 'C')
    return total_actions / (len(other_players_actions) * 1.0)
```

---

### **Explanation:**

This strategy balances cooperation with individual gain, ensuring sustainability while adapting to others' behaviors. By using fixed thresholds for stock levels and dynamic adjustments based on historical cooperation rates, the strategy aims to maintain a cooperative equilibrium unless exploitation or critical resource levels necessitate defection. This approach is robust against various opponent strategies and ensures optimal payoff under different game conditions.

To address the problem of balancing cooperation and defection in managing a shared resource over multiple rounds, we propose an adaptive strategy that responds to observed trends in resource levels. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first round to encourage others to do the same, fostering a cooperative environment.

2. **Monitor Resource Trends**:
   - Track the stock level after each round, noting how much of the resource remains and whether it's growing or declining.
   - Calculate a moving average of the stock levels over the last few rounds (e.g., 3-5) to identify trends.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision-Making**:
   - Establish a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity) above which cooperation is sustained because it indicates a healthy, sustainable resource.
   - If the average stock level falls below this threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoff as cooperation is no longer effective.

4. **Endgame Adjustment**:
   - In the final rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds), anticipate that others will defect and adjust your strategy accordingly, switching to defection to avoid being exploited.

This strategy dynamically adapts based on observed data, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary. It balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, aiming for optimal collective payoff.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate initially, then monitor the resource's health using a threshold-based approach, and adjust behavior in the final rounds. Here's how it works:

- **First Round**: Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds**: Calculate the moving average of stock levels over recent rounds. If above 60% capacity, continue cooperation; if below, defect.
- **Final Rounds**: Switch to defection as others are likely to do the same.

This approach maximizes collective payoff while adapting to changing conditions and anticipating endgame behavior.

description_COLLECTIVE_76 = '''
To address the problem of encouraging cooperation while preventing resource collapse in a repeated game setting, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both the number of cooperating players and the current state of the shared resource. The strategy is designed to balance individual self-interest with the collective good, ensuring sustainable payoffs over multiple rounds.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Player Behavior and Resource State**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Decision:** Cooperate (C)
     - **Reasoning:** Begin with cooperation to encourage others to follow suit, maintaining high resource levels for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   a. Determine the number of players who chose to Cooperate in the previous round.
   b. Calculate the cooperation rate as `(Number of Cooperators) / n`.
   c. Check if the current stock level is above a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
   d. **Decision:**
      - If both conditions are met (`cooperation rate > X` and `stock > Y`), choose to Cooperate (C).
      - Otherwise, choose to Defect (D).

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Decision:** Defect (D)
     - **Reasoning:** Since there are no future rounds left, defecting maximizes the immediate payoff without concern for long-term consequences.

**Parameters:**

- **Cooperation Rate Threshold (X):** This threshold determines the minimum proportion of players that need to cooperate in the previous round for you to decide to cooperate. A lower threshold encourages more cooperation but risks being exploited by defectors.
- **Stock Level Threshold (Y):** This threshold ensures that cooperation is only maintained when the resource level is sufficient to sustain it and allows for growth, preventing unnecessary depletion.

**Example:**

Let's consider a scenario with 4 players (n=4) and a capacity of 100 units. The initial stock is set at 100.

- **Round 1:** All players Cooperate. Stock remains high and grows back to full capacity due to the cooperative actions.
  
- **Round 2:** Observing that all players cooperated in Round 1, and the stock level is above the threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), you decide to Cooperate again.

- **Round 3:** Suppose two players defect. The stock after consumption would be lower, but if your strategy's cooperation rate threshold is set at 40%, seeing that half of the players still cooperate might encourage you to continue cooperating in Round 4, helping to stabilize the resource.

This approach ensures that cooperation is maintained when beneficial and sustainable, while also allowing for defection when necessary to prevent exploitation or resource collapse.

**Conclusion:**

By implementing this adaptive strategy, each player can contribute to maintaining a balance between individual gains and collective resource management. The strategy encourages cooperation under favorable conditions and adapts by defecting when the resource state or cooperative behavior of others warrants it. This approach helps sustain the shared resource over multiple rounds, promoting mutual benefits for all players involved.

**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over all rounds by balancing cooperation and defection based on player behavior and stock levels.

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Start with Cooperate in the first round to encourage a sustainable resource level.

2. **Adaptive Behavior:**
   - For each subsequent round, observe the number of Defectors from the previous round.
   - If more than 20% of players Defected, switch to Defecting for the next few rounds to prevent exploitation.
   - Monitor the current stock level:
     - If above 50% of capacity, continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability.
     - If below 50%, revert to Cooperating to preserve the remaining stock.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds, switch back to Cooperating to maximize long-term gains and avoid unnecessary depletion.

**Rationale:**
- The strategy begins with Cooperation to foster a sustainable environment.
- It adapts by defecting when others exploit, preventing undue resource loss.
- By monitoring stock levels, it ensures sustainability even as the game progresses.
- Near the end, reverting to Cooperation preserves resources for all players, maximizing collective payoff.

This approach dynamically balances between rewarding Cooperation and protecting against Defection, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_78 = '''
To address the problem, we developed a strategic approach that balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability, adapting based on current conditions and historical behavior. Here's the final strategy:

**Final Answer:**

Adopt an initial cooperative stance to foster resource sustainability. Monitor the stock level and the prevalence of defection among other players in recent rounds. Switch to defection when the stock is low or when a significant number of others are defecting, ensuring short-term gains while attempting to maintain cooperation when possible. Near the end of the game, prioritize immediate payoffs by defecting.

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_79 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation and defection based on stock levels and trends. The strategy is designed to encourage mutual cooperation while adapting to potential defection.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to maintain a high stock, promoting sustainable growth and setting a positive precedent for other players.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Decision Rule:** Cooperate if the current stock is above a dynamically adjusted threshold (initially 75% of capacity) and the trend shows stable or increasing stock levels.
   - **Action:** Defect otherwise, particularly if the stock is below a critical level or showing significant depletion.

3. **Later Rounds:**
   - **Adjustment:** Gradually increase the tendency to defect as rounds approach the end (e.g., last 10% of rounds), focusing on maximizing immediate payoffs without regard for future consequences.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Use a moving average or trend analysis over recent rounds to adjust the cooperation threshold.
   - If the stock decreases significantly, lower the threshold to encourage more defecting and attempt to stabilize resource levels.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - **Last Round(s):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number):
    capacity = game.capacity
    n = game.n
    r = game.r
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate dynamic threshold based on stock trend
    recent_stock = history[-5:]  # Adjust window size as needed
    average_change = sum(stock_next - stock_curr for stock_curr, stock_next in zip(recent_stock[:-1], recent_stock[1:])) / len(recent_stock)
    
    if average_change < 0:
        threshold = max(capacity * 0.6, stock)  # Adjust thresholds as needed
    else:
        threshold = capacity * 0.75
    
    if stock > threshold and round_number <= r - (r // 10):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins by cooperating to maintain the resource, encouraging others to do the same.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** By analyzing recent stock trends, the strategy adapts its cooperation threshold. If the stock is declining, it lowers the threshold, prompting more defection to prevent further depletion.
- **Gradual Defection in Later Rounds:** As the game nears its end, players prioritize immediate payoffs by defecting, recognizing there's no future punishment for such actions.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to encourage cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_80 = '''
The strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by using adaptive cooperation and defection based on stock levels and historical behavior. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Balance Strategy (ABS)

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Starts with maximum stock, ensuring a positive precedent for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Use thresholds to decide actions:
     - If current stock > 30% of capacity: Cooperate.
     - Else: Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maintains stock health when sufficient, allowing growth; defects when stock is low to prevent further depletion.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** No future rounds, so maximize immediate payoff.

4. **Adaptation Based on Past Behavior:**
   - If previous rounds had high cooperation, continue Cooperating to sustain the resource.
   - If many Defected previously, respond by Defecting more to prevent exploitation.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, round_number, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif 2 <= round_number < r:
        threshold = 0.3 * capacity
        if stock > threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else: # final round
        return 'D'

def update_history(history, action, payoffs):
    history.append({
        'action': action,
        'payoff': sum(payoffs),
        'stock_level': current_stock()
    })
```

### Considerations and Potential Improvements

- **Threshold Adjustment:** The 30% threshold is a starting point. Adjusting it based on game parameters (n, r) could optimize outcomes.
- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Incorporate historical consumption rates to adjust thresholds dynamically for better adaptation.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** Tailor strategies for scenarios with large n or small r to account for individual impacts and limited rounds.

This strategy encourages sustainable resource management while adapting to opponents' behaviors, aiming to maximize long-term payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_81 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

**Objective:** To sustainably manage the common pool resource while maximizing individual payoffs through adaptive cooperation and defection based on dynamic thresholds.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate in the first 2-3 rounds to establish a baseline of sustainable use and observe opponents' behavior.

2. **Dynamic Threshold for Cooperation:**
   - Calculate a threshold `S_threshold` that adjusts based on the number of rounds remaining:
     ```
     S_threshold = capacity * (1 - (current_round / total_rounds) * 0.5)
     ```
     This ensures higher thresholds early on, encouraging cooperation when more rounds are left.

3. **Cooperation Decision:**
   - Cooperate if the current stock `S` is above `S_threshold` or if there are many rounds remaining to encourage long-term sustainability.
     ```
     if S > S_threshold or rounds_left > 0.6 * total_rounds:
         choose C
     ```

4. **Defection Decision:**
   - Defect if the stock is below the threshold and there are fewer rounds left, prioritizing immediate payoff to avoid future depletion.
     ```
     else:
         choose D
     ```

5. **Historical Trend Adjustment:**
   - If the historical trend shows a decreasing stock, lower the cooperation threshold to encourage defecting and prevent rapid depletion.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate to start with sustainability and observe opponents' actions.

2. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds):**
   - Adjust `S_threshold` lower to prioritize immediate gains, as future sustainability is less critical.
     ```
     if current_round > total_rounds - 3:
         S_threshold = capacity * 0.5
     ```

3. **Stock Near Capacity:**
   - Continue Cooperating to maintain the resource and encourage others to do the same.

4. **Stock Near Depletion (e.g., below 20% of capacity):**
   - Defect more frequently to maximize immediate payoff before potential collapse.

---

### **Collective Mindset Alignment**

- **Sustainability First:** Prioritize cooperation when resources are abundant to ensure long-term availability.
- **Adaptability:** Adjust strategies dynamically based on current stock levels and remaining rounds to balance immediate gains with future sustainability.
- **Observation and Reaction:** Monitor opponents' actions; if many defect, consider defecting more to prevent personal loss.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, current_round, total_rounds):
    # Initial cooperation in the first few rounds
    if current_round <= 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate dynamic threshold based on remaining rounds
    rounds_left = total_rounds - current_round + 1
    threshold_depletion = 0.5 * (current_round / total_rounds)
    S_threshold = capacity * (1 - threshold_depletion)
    
    # Check if stock is above the threshold or many rounds left
    if current_stock > S_threshold or rounds_left > 0.6 * total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Consider historical trend
        historical_trend = calculate_historical_stock_change()
        if historical_trend < -10:  # Arbitrary threshold for decreasing trend
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'D' if current_stock <= S_threshold else 'C'

# Helper function to calculate historical trend
def calculate_historical_stock_change():
    # Implementation would track past stock levels and compute the trend
    pass
```

---

### **Summary**

The ATC strategy adapts dynamically based on the game's progression, encouraging cooperation when resources are plentiful and defecting when necessary to maximize payoffs. By balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, this strategy aims to perform well across various opponent behaviors in the tournament.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_82 = '''
The collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability. It adapts based on observed behavior and stock health without relying on coordination mechanisms.

**Strategy Overview:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to follow suit, setting a baseline for expected consumption.

2. **Monitor Consumption:** For each subsequent round, calculate the previous round's total consumption. Compare this to the expected consumption if all players had Cooperated (S_prev / 2).

3. **Detect Defectors:** If total consumption exceeds a set threshold above the expected level, it indicates potential Defectors. Switch to Defecting for a limited number of rounds as a deterrent.

4. **Return to Cooperation:** After defecting for a predetermined period or when the stock replenishes sufficiently, revert to Cooperating to promote sustainable resource management.

5. **Final Rounds Adjustment:** In the last few rounds (e.g., 20%), adjust strategy to balance current payoffs with preserving the stock, possibly leaning towards Cooperation to avoid depletion.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def collective_strategy(round_number, total_rounds, stock_history, actions_history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = initial_capacity()
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate previous round's consumption
    prev_stock = stock_history[-2]
    prev_consumption = prev_stock - stock_history[-1] + growth_calculation(prev_stock, capacity)
    
    expected_coop = prev_stock / (2 * n)  # Expected per player if all Cooperate
    total_expected = n * expected_coop
    
    # Determine if Defectors were present
    threshold = 1.2  # Adjust based on simulations
    if prev_consumption > threshold * total_expected:
        return 'D'  # Defect for a limited number of rounds
    else:
        return 'C'
    
    # Additional checks for final rounds and stock level
    if round_number > (total_rounds - 0.2 * total_rounds):
        if stock_history[-1] < capacity / 4:
            return 'C'  # Preserve stock in final rounds
    
def growth_calculation(s_remaining, capacity):
    return 2 * s_remaining * (1 - s_remaining / capacity)
```

**Key Considerations:**

- **Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold for detecting Defectors should be tuned based on simulations to avoid false positives while promptly reacting to actual Defection.

- **Stock Management:** Aim to maintain the stock around capacity/2 for optimal growth, adjusting strategies to prevent over-depletion or under-utilization.

This strategy promotes sustainability by encouraging Cooperation initially and adapting to detect and deter Defectors, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_83 = '''
To address the problem of managing a shared resource, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy is designed to encourage cooperation while allowing players to adapt based on the current state of the resource.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define a Target Stock Level:** Set a target stock level (e.g., half of the maximum capacity) as a threshold for deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect.

2. **Assess Current Stock Level:** At the beginning of each round, evaluate if the current stock is above or below the defined target.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** If the current stock is above the target, players should Cooperate to maintain sustainable use and allow for growth.
   - **Defect (D):** If the current stock is at or below the target, players should Defect to maximize their immediate payoff, recognizing that the resource may be overused.

4. **Consider Trends and Recovery:** Introduce a mechanism to reassess cooperation after a period of defecting if the stock begins to recover, preventing perpetual depletion.

5. **Adaptation Over Time:** Monitor the effectiveness of the strategy and adjust thresholds or rules as needed based on observed outcomes and player behavior patterns.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is for each player to Cooperate when the current stock exceeds half of the maximum capacity and Defect otherwise, with provisions to reassess cooperation if the resource begins to recover. This approach aims to balance immediate gains against long-term sustainability, encouraging mutual cooperation while allowing adaptation based on the resource's health.

**Answer:**

Each player should Cooperate if the current stock is above half of the maximum capacity; otherwise, they should Defect. This strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable use, promoting cooperation when possible and adapting to prevent resource depletion.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock > 0.5 × max capacity; else, Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_84 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances individual gains with the collective need to preserve the resource. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating (C) when the stock is above half of the capacity. This helps maintain sustainable payoffs and prevents rapid depletion.

2. **Defection Threshold**: Switch to defecting (D) if the stock falls below half the capacity. This action maximizes immediate gains while preventing over-depletion that could lead to long-term losses.

3. **Sustainability Check**: Each round, assess the current stock level relative to the threshold. Cooperate if above; defect if below.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always cooperate to maintain a high initial stock.
   - **Last Rounds**: Consider defecting more aggressively as future payoffs are limited, but balance this to avoid sudden stock collapse.

This strategy ensures adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors by focusing on the current state without relying on communication or coordination beyond simple rules. It promotes cooperation when sustainable and switches to defection when necessary, balancing short-term gains with long-term resource preservation.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```
for each round from 1 to r:
    if stock > capacity / 2:
        choose C
    else:
        choose D
    update stock based on all players' actions
end for
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_85 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

Our strategy aims to balance cooperation for long-term sustainability while adaptively responding to potential defection. Here's how it works:

### 1. Initial Rounds (First 2-3)
- **Action:** Cooperate
- **Rationale:** Establish a stable stock level and encourage others to follow suit, promoting sustainable resource use.

### 2. Middle Rounds
- **Monitor Metrics:**
  - **Cooperation Rate:** Average of Cooperate actions from the last x rounds (e.g., 5).
  - **Stock Level:** Current stock relative to capacity.
- **Decision Rules:**
  - If cooperation rate > 70% and stock > 60% of capacity: Cooperate.
  - Otherwise: Defect.
- **Rationale:** Sustain cooperation if others are doing so and the resource is stable. Defect if cooperation drops or the resource is at risk.

### 3. Endgame (Last 2-3 Rounds)
- **Action Consideration:** Tend towards defection to maximize payoffs, but consider current stock to avoid unnecessary depletion.
- **Rationale:** Prioritize immediate gains in final rounds, balancing against potential stock harm.

### 4. Response to Low Stock
- **If stock drops significantly below safe levels despite cooperation:**
  - Switch to a cooperative rebuild phase by temporarily reducing consumption or cooperating more aggressively.
- **Rationale:** Recover the resource for future stability if possible.

### Implementation Notes:
- Use exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) for cooperation rate to balance recent and past trends.
- Include clear triggers for transitioning between phases based on metrics.

This strategy promotes mutual cooperation while adaptively handling defection, ensuring robust performance against varying opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_86 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a strategic approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observable metrics. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first round to establish trust and promote a sustainable resource base.

2. **Adaptation Based on Previous Behavior**:
   - After the first round, assess the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - If more than two-thirds (approximately 67%) of the players cooperated last round, it indicates a willingness to maintain sustainability.

3. **Resource Check**: Evaluate the current stock level relative to its initial capacity.
   - If the stock is above 80% of its initial capacity, it suggests that the resource is healthy and can sustain cooperation.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - If both conditions are met (sufficient cooperation from others and a healthy resource), continue to cooperate in the current round.
   - Otherwise, defect to either maximize immediate payoff or prevent further depletion of the resource.

5. **Final Round Adjustment**: In the last round, switch to defection since there's no future impact to consider.

This strategy aims to foster collective sustainability while protecting against exploitation by defectors, ensuring a balance between individual gain and group welfare.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

The proposed strategy is designed to promote cooperation when it leads to sustainable resource management and switches to defection when necessary to prevent collapse or maximize immediate payoff. Here's how it works:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Count the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - Check if the current stock is above 80% of its initial capacity.
   - If more than two-thirds of players cooperated and the stock is sufficiently high, continue to cooperate.
   - Otherwise, defect to either exploit the resource or protect against further depletion.
3. **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

This approach ensures that cooperation is maintained when it's effective, while defection is used strategically to address threats of resource collapse or exploit situations where others have defected.

**Final Answer:**

The strategy balances cooperation and defection based on the previous round's behavior and current resource levels. It starts with cooperation, continues if sustainable conditions are met, and defects otherwise or in the final round. This approach is encapsulated as:

- Cooperate initially.
- Continue cooperating if >67% of players did so last round and stock >80% capacity.
- Defect otherwise or in the last round.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when sustainable; defect when necessary}}$

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Triggers**

**Objective:**  
To maximize individual payoff while maintaining a sustainable common pool resource, balancing cooperation for long-term benefits and defection when necessary.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

#### **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to maintain the resource and encourage others to do the same.

#### **Subsequent Rounds:**
- **Action:** Base decision on the historical consumption rate from previous rounds.
- **Cooperate (C) if:** The average historical per-player consumption is ≤ 1 unit (indicating cooperation).
- **Defect (D) if:** The average historical per-player consumption > 1 unit (indicating defection).

#### **Final Few Rounds:**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C) unless the remaining stock is very high, in which case defect (D).
- **Rationale:** Preserve resources for sustainability while not missing out on potential gains.

---

### **2. Monitoring and Triggers**

- **Historical Consumption Check:** Calculate the average per-player consumption from the past `k` rounds (e.g., k=3) to detect trends.
  - If average > 1 unit, defect in response.
  - If average ≤ 1 unit, cooperate.

- **Stock Threshold Check:** After each round, if the stock is below a critical level (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to cooperation regardless of past consumption to prevent collapse.

---

### **3. Edge Cases Handling**

#### **First Round:**
- Always Cooperate to set a positive example and maintain resource levels.

#### **Last Few Rounds:**
- If rounds remaining ≤ 5, defect only if stock is above a threshold (e.g., >60% capacity) to prevent excessive depletion.
- Otherwise, cooperate to sustain the resource.

---

### **4. Adaptation Mechanism**

- After defecting for `m` consecutive rounds (e.g., m=2), reassess cooperation levels.
  - If cooperation is restored, revert to Cooperate.
  - If defection persists, continue defecting but monitor stock closely.

- If stock drops below a critical level during defection periods, immediately switch to Cooperate to aid recovery.

---

### **5. Pseudocode Outline**

```pseudocode
Initialize strategy with cooperate in the first round.

For each round from 1 to r:
    If current round is 1:
        Choose C
    Else:
        Calculate historical average consumption over past k rounds
        If historical average > 1:
            Choose D for m consecutive rounds, then reassess
        Else:
            Choose C
    After action:
        Monitor stock level
        If stock < critical threshold:
            Switch to C regardless of previous decisions

Handle last few rounds (e.g., last 5):
    If stock > high_threshold:
        Choose D
    Else:
        Choose C
```

---

### **6. Rationale**

- Starting with cooperation fosters a sustainable environment.
- Using historical data detects trends in others' behavior, allowing responsive actions.
- Stock thresholds prevent resource collapse and encourage recovery.
- Adaptation ensures the strategy remains flexible to changing dynamics without prolonged cycles of defection.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability, adapting to various opponent behaviors while promoting cooperation when beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_88 = '''
The strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game is an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with defection based on the current stock level, trends over time, and the proximity to the end of the game. Here's a structured outline of the strategy:

### Decision Rules:
1. **High Stock Level (S ≥ 2/3 * Capacity):**
   - Cooperate unless it is within the last 10% of rounds.
   
2. **Moderate Stock Level (1/3 * Capacity < S < 2/3 * Capacity):**
   - Evaluate the trend of stock levels over recent rounds.
     - If the stock is decreasing, increase the likelihood of defecting.
     - If stable or increasing, continue to cooperate.

3. **Low Stock Level (S ≤ 1/3 * Capacity):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as future gains are limited due to low resource levels.

### Edge Cases:
- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate since the stock is at maximum capacity.
  
- **Last 10% of Rounds:**
  - Shift towards defecting more frequently to capture remaining resources before the game concludes.

### Strategy Summary:
The strategy prioritizes cooperation when the resource level is high to ensure sustainability. It adapts by considering recent trends in stock levels and switches to defection when necessary, especially as the game nears its conclusion. This approach balances individual gain with collective resource management.

# Final Answer

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Strategy:**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Start by Cooperating since the stock is at its maximum capacity, ensuring stability and sustainability.

2. **High Stock Level (S ≥ 2/3 * Capacity):**
   - Continue Cooperating unless nearing the end of the game (last 10% rounds), where defecting becomes advantageous for immediate gains.

3. **Moderate Stock Level (1/3 * S < 2/3 * Capacity):**
   - Monitor stock trends:
     - If decreasing, increase defection likelihood to maximize current payoffs.
     - If stable or increasing, maintain cooperation.

4. **Low Stock Level (S ≤ 1/3 * Capacity):**
   - Defect to capitalize on remaining resources, as future gains are limited.

5. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% Rounds):**
   - Shift to defecting more often to capture what's left before the game concludes.

**Answer:**

The strategy is to Cooperate when the stock level is above two-thirds of capacity and not in the final stages, adapt based on stock trends in moderate levels, Defect at low levels, and shift towards Defection near the end. This approach balances resource sustainability with individual payoff maximization.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate at high levels; defect as needed or nearing game end}}

To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource level through collective action without communication, the following strategy is proposed:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy balances cooperation and defection based on observable state variables (current stock level) and recent history (number of defectors). It aims to sustain the resource when possible and switch to exploitation when necessary.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Establishes a baseline for sustainable resource use.

2. **Middle Rounds (from round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1: Assess Current Stock Level**
     - If stock > 0.8 * capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - Rationale: The resource is healthy and can sustain current use.
     - If stock < 0.6 * capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - Rationale: Exploit remaining resources to maximize immediate payoff before potential depletion.
   - **Step 2: Evaluate Recent Behavior**
     - If the stock is between 0.6 and 0.8 * capacity:
       - Look at the number of defectors in the last three rounds.
       - If more than half were defecting:
         - **Action:** Defect (D)
           - Rationale: Prevent being exploited by others who are defecting.
       - Otherwise:
         - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
           - Rationale: Maintain sustainable resource use when others are cooperating.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff with no future rounds to penalize exploitation.

### Summary of Decision Rules:
- **Cooperate** when the stock is above 80% of capacity.
- **Defect** when the stock drops below 60% or if more than half defected in recent rounds.
- In intermediate cases, cooperate unless there's evidence of widespread defection.

This strategy aims to sustain resource levels while protecting against exploitation, ensuring a balance between cooperation and self-interest.

description_COLLECTIVE_90 = '''
The designed collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances cooperation for sustainability with defection when necessary. It adapts dynamically based on the current state of the resource, opponents' behaviors, and game progression.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above a dynamically adjusted threshold.
   - Defect otherwise to maximize immediate payoff or prevent overexploitation.

2. **Threshold Calculation:**
   - The threshold starts as 80% of capacity and adjusts each round based on:
     - Stock growth rate (higher growth increases threshold, encouraging more cooperation).
     - Opponents' actions (more defecting lowers the threshold to reduce exploitation risk).

3. **Adaptation Mechanism:**
   - After each round, update the threshold using a formula that considers stock replenishment and opponents' defection rates.
   - Example adjustment: If growth is high, increase the threshold by 5%; if low or negative, decrease by 10%.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others and preserve the resource.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20% of rounds):** Lower the threshold to avoid overusing resources with fewer future benefits.
   - **Stock Collapse (near 0):** Defect to maximize remaining payoff, despite limited long-term gains.

5. **Learning from Opponents:**
   - Track opponents' cooperation levels each round. If defecting is prevalent, adjust the threshold lower to minimize exploitation risk.

### Pseudocode:

```python
Initialize:
    threshold = 0.8 * capacity  # Start at 80% of capacity
    rounds_remaining = r

For each round t in 1..r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    if current_stock > threshold:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate
    else:
        action = 'D'  # Defect
    
    record_action(action)
    calculate_growth(current_stock, actions_of_all_players)
    new_stock = update_stock(current_stock, growth)
    
    # Adjust threshold based on growth and opponents' behavior
    if growth > 0.1 * capacity:  # Significant replenishment
        threshold *= 1.05  # Increase threshold by 5%
    else:
        threshold *= 0.90  # Decrease threshold by 10%
    
    # Ensure threshold stays within [2n, capacity] bounds
    threshold = max(min(threshold, capacity), 2 * n)
    
    # For the last few rounds, adjust threshold to be more cautious
    if t > r - 0.2 * r:  # Last 20% of rounds
        threshold = threshold * 0.95  # Become slightly more risk-averse
    
    # If stock is near collapse, encourage defecting
    if new_stock < 0.1 * capacity:
        threshold = max(threshold, capacity)  # Force higher threshold to promote defecting

End
```

### Explanation:

The strategy dynamically adapts to maintain a balance between preserving the resource and maximizing individual payoffs. It encourages cooperation when the stock is healthy and defects when necessary to prevent collapse or exploitation by others. By adjusting thresholds based on observed growth and opponents' behaviors, it remains robust against various strategies in a competitive environment.

**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Begin with Cooperation in the first round to establish a cooperative tone and maximize initial resource growth.

2. **Dynamic Thresholds Based on Stock Health:**
   - **High Stock (Above 80% of Capacity):** Continue Cooperating to allow sustainable growth.
   - **Moderate Stock (40-80%):** 
     - If most players Cooperated in the previous round, continue Cooperating.
     - If a significant number Defected, consider adjusting actions towards Defection if stock is declining.
   - **Low Stock (Below 40%):** Shift towards more Defecting to salvage immediate payoffs before potential collapse.

3. **Learning and Adaptation:**
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on the stock's response to collective actions. If the stock grows despite some Defectors, be more lenient with lower thresholds for Cooperation.

4. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - If a player defects when most others Cooperated, respond by defecting in subsequent rounds to discourage such behavior and encourage future Cooperation.

5. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - Balance between immediate gains and preventing stock collapse. Consider a mix of Coop and Def based on remaining rounds to optimize payoffs without causing rapid depletion.

6. **Forgiving Mechanism:**
   - After a round where many players Defected, revert to Cooperation in the next round if most others Cooperate, helping rebuild trust and sustainable resource levels.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
for each player:
    for each round from 1 to r:
        if current_round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            stock_history = get_stock_history()
            defector_count = count_defectors_in_previous_rounds()
            
            if stock > 0.8 * capacity:
                action = 'C'
            elif 0.4 * capacity < stock <= 0.8 * capacity:
                if defector_count / n < threshold_for_coop:
                    action = 'C'
                else:
                    action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'D' if round > last_round - endgame_buffer else adaptive_action()
        
        submit_action(action)
```

This strategy balances cooperation with adaptability, encouraging sustainable resource management while addressing potential defection through dynamic adjustments and punitive measures.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_92 = '''
**Final Answer:**

The strategy is designed to adaptively balance cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and its trends, promoting collective resource management while maximizing individual payoffs.

---

### **Strategy Description: Adaptive Threshold-Based Cooperation**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 3 rounds):**
   - Cooperate to build a stable stock level and encourage others to follow suit by maintaining high payoffs through sustainable consumption.

2. **Monitoring Stock Trends:**
   - Track the stock level over time.
   - Calculate whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable relative to capacity.

3. **Decision Rules Based on Stock Health:**
   - **Above 80% of Capacity:** Continue Cooperating to sustain high payoffs and maintain resource health.
   - **Between 60%-80% with a Downward Trend:** Consider Defecting to maximize immediate gains while others may still be cooperating.
   - **Below 60%:** Increase Defection to exploit remaining resources before potential collapse.

4. **Adjustment Based on Past Actions:**
   - If stock shows rapid depletion, infer that many players are defecting and respond by defecting to prevent being exploited as a cooperator.

5. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - Shift back to Cooperating to maximize possible payoffs before the game ends, assuming others might do the same.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Start by Cooperating to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Prioritize cooperation to ensure maximum possible payoff from remaining resources.

---

### **Rationale:**

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability. By cooperating when the resource is healthy and defecting as it depletes, each player adapts to observable state variables without needing explicit coordination. This approach aims to prevent rapid depletion while ensuring personal payoffs remain high, promoting a stable equilibrium where cooperation persists until necessary adjustments are made.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_93 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategy that balances sustainable cooperation with maximizing individual payoffs towards the end of the game. The decision rules are structured to maintain the resource when it's abundant and exploit it efficiently as the game concludes.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Thresholds:**
   - Define an upper threshold at 75% of capacity (`capacity * 0.75`) and a lower threshold at 25% of capacity (`capacity * 0.25`).

2. **Early Rounds Strategy:**
   - For rounds until `r - X` (where `X` is a small number, e.g., 5), players should cooperate if the current stock `S` is above the upper threshold. This ensures sustainable use of the resource.
   - If `S` drops below the lower threshold, players defect to prevent further depletion and maximize immediate gains.

3. **Late Rounds Strategy:**
   - In the last `X` rounds, all players defect regardless of the stock level to maximize their payoffs without worrying about future depletions.

4. **Middle Range Handling:**
   - If `S` is between the lower and upper thresholds, players continue cooperating to try and stabilize or increase the resource level.
   - Incorporate a trend analysis (e.g., comparing current `S` with a moving average of past rounds) to decide if defection is necessary even within this range.

5. **Edge Cases Management:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate since `S = capacity`.
   - **Stock Near Capacity:** Maintain cooperation to preserve the resource.
   - **Near Endgame:** Defect in the final rounds to exploit remaining resources without regard for future sustainability.

**Final Answer (Decision Rules):**

- If it's among the last 5 rounds (`t >= r - 4`), defect.
- Else, if current stock `S > capacity * 0.75`, cooperate.
- Else, if `S < capacity * 0.25`, defect.
- Otherwise, continue cooperating to maintain or increase the resource level.

This strategy ensures sustainable use during early rounds while maximizing individual gains in the final stages, balancing cooperation and exploitation effectively. 

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S > 75\% \text{ capacity and not near end; defect otherwise}}

description_COLLECTIVE_94 = '''
To design an adaptive strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that balances cooperation and defection based on the current state of the resource, we focus on dynamically adjusting our actions using the stock level as a key indicator. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating to preserve the resource and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Use a decreasing threshold based on remaining rounds to decide between Cooperate (C) and Defect (D). If the stock is above this threshold, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.
3. **Endgame Defection:** Switch to always Defecting in the final 10% of rounds to maximize immediate payoffs without worrying about future consequences.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Preserve the resource and promote sustainability from the start.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-0.1r):**
   - Calculate the dynamically adjusted threshold:
     - `threshold = capacity * (remaining_rounds / total_rounds)`
     - This threshold decreases as rounds progress, encouraging defection in later stages.
   - Decision Rule:
     - If current stock > threshold: Cooperate (C)
     - Else: Defect (D)

3. **Last 10% of Rounds (Rounds r-0.1r to r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoffs without regard for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock, capacity):
    remaining_rounds = total_rounds - current_round + 1
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif remaining_rounds > 0.1 * total_rounds:
        threshold = capacity * (remaining_rounds / total_rounds)
        if stock > threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Edge Cases and Considerations:

- **Stock Below Critical Levels:** If the stock drops extremely low, the strategy inherently encourages defection as the threshold would be lower.
- **Observation of Other Players:** While not explicitly using others' past actions, the strategy adapts to collective behavior indirectly through changes in the stock level.

### Conclusion:
This strategy aims to maximize long-term sustainability while adapting to potential exploitation by switching towards defection in later rounds. It dynamically balances cooperation and defection based on the resource's health and remaining game duration, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_95 = '''
To address the problem of optimizing individual payoff while considering the collective impact on resource sustainability, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round:** Always Cooperate to establish a baseline of sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity, Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - If the stock drops below 80%, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoff as the resource is already under stress.
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - In the final round, always Defect to capitalize on any remaining resources.

This strategy balances between sustaining the resource when it's healthy and exploiting it when it's depleted, thus maximizing individual gain without causing unnecessary collapse in early rounds.

### Formalized Decision Rules:
1. **If current round is the last round:** Defect.
2. **Else if current stock \( S > 0.8 \times \text{capacity} \):** Cooperate.
3. **Else:** Defect.

This approach ensures that the resource remains sustainable when healthy and allows individuals to maximize their payoff when the resource is already under stress.

### Final Answer:
The optimal strategy for maximizing individual payoff while considering collective impact is:

\boxed{
\begin{cases}
\text{Defect} & \text{if it's the last round}, \\
\text{Cooperate} & \text{if current stock } S > 0.8 \times \text{capacity}, \\
\text{Defect} & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
}

This strategy provides a balance between sustainability and exploitation, ensuring that the resource is preserved when healthy and exploited when necessary to maximize individual gains.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_96 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation among multiple players while preserving a shared resource, an adaptive strategy is proposed. This strategy balances cooperation with necessary defection based on both the current state of the resource and the historical behavior of other players.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Players start by cooperating to encourage sustainable resource use.
2. **Monitoring Mechanisms**:
   - **Stock Level**: Track the current stock relative to capacity (e.g., thresholds at 80% and 40%).
   - **Cooperation Rates**: Monitor the proportion of players who cooperated in recent rounds.
   - **Trend Analysis**: Assess whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable over time.
3. **Decision Rules**:
   - Cooperate if the stock is healthy (above 80%) and sufficient others are cooperating (over 60%).
   - Defect if the stock is critically low (below 40%) or cooperation rates drop significantly despite a healthy stock.
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust behavior based on trends in both resource levels and cooperation rates to sustain cooperation when beneficial and defect when necessary.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```plaintext
For each player i:
    Initialize cooperate_last_round = True
    stock_history = []
    
    For each round t from 1 to r:
        If t == 1:
            action_i = Cooperate
        Else:
            count_coop = number of players who Cooperated in previous round
            proportion_coop = count_coop / n
            
            if len(stock_history) >= 3:
                trend = calculate_trend(stock_history[-3:])
            else:
                trend = 'stable'
            
            if stock_current > 0.8 * capacity:
                if proportion_coop > 0.6 and (trend == 'increasing' or trend == 'stable'):
                    action_i = Cooperate
                else:
                    action_i = Defect
            elif stock_current < 0.4 * capacity:
                action_i = Defect
            else:  # between 40% and 80%
                if proportion_coop > 0.6 and (trend == 'increasing' or trend == 'stable'):
                    action_i = Cooperate
                else:
                    action_i = Defect
        
        Update stock_history with current stock
        Record action_i and observe others' actions for next round.
    
    If t == r:  # Last round
        action_i = Defect
```

### Key Components:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages a positive start, allowing players to build trust and assess others' behavior.
- **Threshold-Based Decisions**: Uses stock levels (80%, 40%) and cooperation rates (60%) as indicators for when to cooperate or defect.
- **Trend Analysis**: Helps anticipate future resource conditions, enabling proactive adjustments in strategy.

This strategy aims to sustain cooperation while being responsive to changes in resource health and other players' actions, ensuring a balance between individual gain and collective resource preservation.

**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (t=1):**
   - All players Cooperate to establish a baseline and avoid immediate resource depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t>1):**
   - Calculate the stock after consumption from the previous round.
   - Determine if the stock is above, below, or equal to a sustainability threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
     - If above the threshold and stable/increasing: Continue Cooperating.
     - If below or decreasing: Switch to Defecting to reduce consumption and allow recovery.

3. **Last Few Rounds (t approaching r):**
   - Maintain Cooperation to maximize cumulative payoffs, despite the game nearing its end.

4. **Response to Others' Actions:**
   - If previous rounds saw significant Defection leading to low stock: Cooperate to replenish.
   - If most Cooperated and stock was stable/increasing: Continue Cooperating.

5. **Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Dynamically adjust the sustainability threshold based on historical performance:
     - Increase if stock remains stable with Cooperation.
     - Lower if stock decreases, prompting more Defecting.

6. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - Initial rounds focus on building resource stability.
   - Final rounds maintain Cooperation to maximize payoffs.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
For each player i:
    For each round t = 1 to r:
        If t == 1:
            Action = Cooperate
        Else:
            Calculate stock after consumption (S_prev)
            Determine sustainability threshold (e.g., capacity * 0.5)
            If S_prev > threshold and trend is stable/increasing:
                Action = Cooperate
            Else:
                Action = Defect
        Record action, observe others' actions, and update thresholds based on historical performance.
```

**Conclusion:**
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability by adapting to current conditions and adjusting strategies based on past outcomes. It is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors while promoting collective cooperation for optimal payoffs.

description_COLLECTIVE_98 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock Levels**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to maintain a high stock level and encourage sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Cooperate if:** The current stock is above 70% of the capacity.
   - **Assess Trends if:** The stock is between 30% and 70%:
     - If the stock has been decreasing over the past few rounds, defect with a higher probability (e.g., 75% chance to Defect).
     - If the trend is stable or increasing, continue Cooperating.
   - **Defect if:** The stock drops below 30% of capacity.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact on the stock.

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation in Early Rounds:** Maintains a high stock level, promoting sustainable growth.
- **Trend Assessment:** Helps anticipate others' actions and adapt accordingly without relying on coordination.
- **Thresholds (70%, 30%):** Provide clear decision points to balance resource maintenance and immediate gains.

This strategy is adaptive, robust, and aligns with collective sustainability goals while being responsive to potential defection trends.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_99 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a decision-making strategy that balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with strategic defection when necessary. Here's a structured summary of the approach:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy is designed to maintain cooperation when the resource stock is healthy or improving and to allow defection when the stock is low or declining. It also considers the progression of the game, adjusting behavior as it nears its conclusion.

### Key Decision Points

1. **Initial State (High Stock):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning:** The resource stock is at capacity, and cooperation ensures sustainable consumption without depleting the resource.

2. **Mid-Game Adjustments:**
   - **Cooperate if:**
     - The current stock exceeds 80% of capacity.
     - The stock is between 60%-80% and has been stable or increasing over recent rounds.
   - **Defect if:**
     - The current stock drops below 60% of capacity.
     - Despite cooperation, the stock continues to decline.

3. **End-Game Considerations:**
   - In the final 25% of rounds, prioritize defecting to maximize immediate payoffs, accepting potential resource depletion since future rounds are limited.

### Detailed Decision Rules

1. **Cooperate Conditions:**
   - When the current stock is above 80% of capacity.
   - Between 60%-80%, if the stock has shown an increasing trend over the past few rounds.

2. **Defect Conditions:**
   - If the stock falls below 60% of capacity.
   - If cooperation in previous rounds hasn't halted a decreasing trend in the stock.

3. **End-Game Adjustment:**
   - In the final quarter of the game, defect to capitalize on remaining resources, even if it leads to depletion.

### Rationale
This strategy aims to sustain the resource by encouraging cooperation when healthy and allowing defection only when necessary or toward the end. It adapts dynamically based on current stock levels and trends, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

By following these rules, players can collectively maintain a stable resource base while adapting to changes and maximizing payoffs as the game concludes.

The "Adaptive Harvest" strategy is designed to maximize payoffs in the Common Pool Resource Game by balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a structured breakdown of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Harvest

1. **Initial Testing Phase (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Purpose:** To observe other players' behaviors and gather data on their tendencies towards cooperation or defection.

2. **Monitoring in Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the historical cooperation rate (H) among all players from previous rounds.
   - Track the current stock level (S).

3. **Decision Rules Based on H and S:**
   - **If H is above a threshold and S is healthy:** Cooperate to sustain the resource and ensure long-term gains.
   - **If H drops below the threshold or S is low:** Defect to maximize immediate payoffs, especially if others are not cooperating.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Defect as part of the initial testing phase.
   - **Last Round:** Defect since there's no future punishment possible.
   - **Stock Near Capacity:** Cooperate if H is high; defect otherwise to test others' willingness.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Defect to avoid being exploited by defectors.

5. **Adjustment Over Time:**
   - Adjust the cooperation threshold based on observed trends, lowering it if more players cooperate and raising it if defection increases.
   - Consider using weighted averages of recent cooperation rates to smooth out fluctuations and stabilize decisions.

### Pseudocode Outline

    coop_count = sum(1 for action in all_player_actions if action == COOPERATE)
    return coop_count / total_actions

# Get current stock level from game state

```

### Conclusion

The "Adaptive Harvest" strategy dynamically adjusts between cooperation and defection based on observed cooperation rates and current resource levels. By starting with a testing phase, it gathers necessary data to inform subsequent decisions, aiming to maximize payoffs while maintaining the sustainability of the common pool resource. This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors and adapts over time to changing conditions in the game.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by adapting to past actions and current stock levels. Here's a structured outline of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Rounds**: Start by Cooperating to build up the common pool resource, setting a positive precedent for sustainability.

2. **Threshold Calculation**:
   - Calculate a weighted average of all players' past actions over the last k rounds, with higher weights on more recent rounds.
   - This cooperation threshold reflects the proportion of times players have Cooperated historically.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - **Cooperate**: If the cooperation threshold is above 0.7 (indicating high past cooperation) and the stock is above 50% of capacity, continue Cooperating to sustain the resource.
   - **Defect**: If the cooperation threshold falls below 0.3 or the stock drops below 25%, switch to Defecting to reduce consumption and allow the resource to recover.
   - **Moderate Stock**: Maintain Cooperation if others are also Cooperating, but remain adaptable based on thresholds.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Default to Cooperate due to lack of history.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 5% of rounds)**: Continue Cooperating unless the stock is extremely low to prevent collapse.
   - **Stock Near Capacity**: Cooperate to maximize sustainable growth.
   - **Stock Near Zero**: Defect temporarily to allow recovery.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate weighted average of past actions
    k = min(20, len(history))  # Consider up to last 20 rounds
    weights = [0.5 ** i for i in range(k)]  # Exponential decay weights
    total_weight = sum(weights)
    
    cooperation_threshold = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if round_number - i - 1 >= 0:
            actions = history[round_number - i - 1]
            avg_coop = sum(1 for a in actions.values() if a == 'C') / len(actions)
            cooperation_threshold += weights[i] * avg_coop
    
    cooperation_threshold /= total_weight
    
    # Determine action based on thresholds and stock level
    high_threshold = 0.7
    low_threshold = 0.3
    mid_stock = capacity * 0.5
    low_stock = capacity * 0.25
    
    if current_stock > mid_stock and cooperation_threshold > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < low_stock or cooperation_threshold < low_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Additional logic for moderate stock conditions can be added here
        return 'C'  # Default to Cooperate if unsure

# Example usage:
history = [...]  # List of past actions per round
current_round = ...  # Current round number
current_stock = get_current_stock()
capacity = ...  # Given capacity

action = decide_action(current_round, history, current_stock, capacity)
```

### Conclusion

This strategy encourages cooperation when beneficial and adapts to defection by others or resource depletion. By dynamically adjusting based on past actions and current stock levels, it aims to maximize both immediate payoffs and long-term sustainability, ensuring the common pool resource remains viable for all players throughout the game.

**Strategy: Adaptive Conditional Cooperation (ACC)**

The Adaptive Conditional Cooperation (ACC) strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability in the Common Pool Resource Game. It dynamically adjusts based on the current stock level and past cooperation trends among players, encouraging mutual cooperation while protecting against exploitation.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Reason: Starting with Cooperation helps maintain the resource at a healthy level, promoting sustainability in subsequent rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds (Remaining 60% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Check Current Stock Level:**
     - If stock > 75% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - Reason: The resource is sufficiently abundant to sustain cooperation without risking depletion.
     - If stock < 50% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - Reason: The resource is under stress, and defecting maximizes immediate gains before potential collapse.
   - **If Stock is Between 50% and 75% of Capacity:**
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate from the previous round (number of Cooperators / n).
     - If cooperation rate > 60%:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - Reason: High cooperation suggests a cooperative environment, encouraging mutual sustainability.
     - If cooperation rate < 40%:
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - Reason: Low cooperation indicates potential exploitation; defecting prevents being taken advantage of.
     - If cooperation rate is between 40% and 60%:
       - Use a weighted decision favoring Cooperate if stock is closer to 75%, or Defect if closer to 50%.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Reason: With no future rounds, maximizing immediate payoff is rational.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate to encourage mutual sustainability.
  
- **Stock Near Capacity (>80%):**
  - Continue Cooperating as growth can sustain the resource.
  
- **Stock Near Depletion (<30%):**
  - Switch to Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources.

---

### **Rationale**

ACC dynamically balances Cooperation and Defection based on observable metrics (current stock, past cooperation rates) to foster a cooperative environment while protecting against exploitation. By adapting to both resource state and player behavior, ACC aims to maximize long-term sustainability and individual payoff.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, prev_coop_rate, total_rounds, current_round):
    if current_round <= 0.2 * total_rounds:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif current_round > 0.8 * total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
            return "Cooperate"
        elif current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return "Defect"
        else:
            if prev_coop_rate > 0.6:
                return "Cooperate"
            elif prev_coop_rate < 0.4:
                return "Defect"
            else:
                # Weighted decision: favor Cooperate if stock is closer to 75%, Defect otherwise
                mid_stock = 0.625 * capacity
                if current_stock > mid_stock:
                    return "Cooperate"
                else:
                    return "Defect"
```

This strategy provides a structured approach to balancing Cooperation and Defection, ensuring adaptability to changing game dynamics while promoting mutual benefits for all players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_103 = '''
The strategy is designed to balance individual gain with collective sustainability by adapting to the current state of the common pool and the behavior of other players. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Default action: Cooperate (C). This sets a positive precedent and encourages others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Calculate Recent Cooperation Rate:** Determine the average cooperation rate among players over recent rounds (e.g., last k rounds).
   - **Stock Check:** Assess if the current stock is above a predefined low threshold (e.g., half of capacity).

3. **Cooperation Thresholds:**
   - If the stock is above the low threshold and the recent cooperation rate exceeds a set percentage (e.g., 70%), choose Cooperate (C).
   - Otherwise, choose Defect (D) to maximize individual payoff when collective action fails.

### Edge Cases:
- **Last Few Rounds:** Adjust cooperation thresholds to be more lenient towards defecting due to the absence of future rounds, acknowledging potential increased defection by others.
- **Low Stock Situations:** If the stock is critically low, prioritize cooperation to facilitate regrowth and prevent complete depletion.

### Pseudocode Summary:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, recent_cooperation_rate):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        low_stock_threshold = capacity / 2
        cooperate_threshold = 0.7  # Example threshold

        if (current_stock > low_stock_threshold and 
            recent_cooperation_rate > cooperate_threshold):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Note: Adjust thresholds based on specific game parameters for optimal performance.
```

### Strategy Justification:
This approach ensures adaptability by considering both the current state of the resource and historical player behavior. It encourages cooperation when beneficial for sustainability but allows defecting when necessary, balancing individual gain with collective outcomes. This robust strategy is designed to perform well against a variety of opponent behaviors in repeated interactions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_104 = '''
To address the problem, we need a strategy that balances cooperation to maintain a healthy stock level with defection to maximize immediate payoffs, especially as the game nears its conclusion. The solution involves monitoring the stock level relative to capacity thresholds and adjusting actions based on previous rounds' majority cooperation.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to build a healthy stock base.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**:
   - **High Stock (Above 75% Capacity)**: Mirror others' actions; if most Cooperated last round, Cooperate again; otherwise, Defect.
   - **Medium Stock (Between 25% and 75% Capacity)**: Always Cooperate to encourage stock growth.
   - **Low Stock (Below 25% Capacity)**: If the majority Cooperated last round, continue Cooperating; else, Defect.
3. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final 20% of rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoffs since there's no future beyond these rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(history, current_round, state, opponent_history):
    capacity = 1  # Assuming normalized capacity
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    medium_low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # Determine the majority action in the last round
    num_players = len(opponent_history)
    last_round_actions = [action[-1] for action in opponent_history]
    cooperate_count = sum(1 for a in last_round_actions if a == 'C')
    majority_cooperate = (cooperate_count / num_players) > 0.5
    
    current_stock = state['current_stock'] if 'current_stock' in state else capacity
    # Adjust the stock calculation as per actual game dynamics if needed
    
    # Check how many rounds are left to determine endgame strategy
    total_rounds = len(history[0]) + 1  # Current round is included
    percentage_remaining = (total_rounds - current_round) / total_rounds
    
    if percentage_remaining <= 0.2:
        return 'Defect'
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        if majority_cooperate:
            return 'Cooperate'
        else:
            return 'Defect'
    elif medium_low_threshold < current_stock <= high_threshold:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:  # current_stock <= medium_low_threshold
        if majority_cooperate:
            return 'Cooperate'
        else:
            return 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round**: The strategy starts by Cooperating to build a healthy stock base.
- **High Stock (Above 75%)**: It mirrors the majority action from the previous round. If most players Cooperated, it continues to Cooperate; otherwise, it Defects.
- **Medium Stock (25% to 75%)**: The strategy always Cooperates to encourage growth and avoid depleting the stock too quickly.
- **Low Stock (Below 25%)**: It Cooperates if the majority did so last round, aiming to rebuild the stock; otherwise, it Defects.
- **Endgame (Final 20% Rounds)**: The strategy defects to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited or nonexistent.

This approach balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and others' actions.

description_COLLECTIVE_105 = '''
**Final Answer: Dynamic Cooperator Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection adaptively, ensuring sustainable resource use while responding to opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round:** Cooperate if the stock is above 80% of capacity. This promotes early sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Cooperate** if the current stock is above a dynamic threshold (adjusting based on n and capacity) and most recent actions show a high proportion of cooperation.
   - **Defect** if the stock is below the threshold or there's significant defection in past rounds, preventing exploitation.
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are irrelevant.
   - **Stock Near Capacity:** Cooperate to maintain high payoffs and resource levels.

### Pseudocode:
```python
function decide_action(stock, history, round_number):
    if round_number == 1:
        if stock >= capacity * 0.8:
            return C
        else:
            return D
    else:
        recent_coop = count(history[-window:]) / window
        current_threshold = calculate_dynamic_threshold(n, capacity)
        
        if stock > current_threshold and recent_coop > 0.6:
            return C
        else:
            return D
```

### Threshold Adjustment:
- **Dynamic Threshold Calculation:** Adjusts based on n and capacity to maintain resource sustainability.
- **Recent Cooperation Check:** Considers the proportion of cooperators in recent rounds to gauge collective behavior.

This strategy promotes cooperation when resources are plentiful and adjusts to defection trends, ensuring robust performance against various opponents.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_106 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

Our strategy balances cooperation with defecting based on stock levels and recent player behavior, aiming to sustain resources while maximizing individual payoffs.

---

### **Strategy Overview**
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to encourage others and maintain a sustainable resource level.
2. **Adaptive Behavior**: In middle rounds, cooperate if the stock is above 75% of capacity and most recent actions were cooperative; otherwise, defect.
3. **Final Round Exploitation**: Defect in the last round to maximize individual payoff.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **First Round (t=1)**:
   - Always Cooperate (`C`) to set a positive precedent.

2. **Middle Rounds (2 ≤ t < r)**:
   - Calculate the current stock `S`.
   - Determine if `S` is above 75% of capacity.
   - Check recent cooperation by counting cooperations in the last 3 rounds.
     - If more than half were Cooperate and `S > 0.75 * capacity`, continue Cooperating.
     - Otherwise, Defect (`D`).

3. **Last Round (t=r)**:
   - Always Defect (`D`) to maximize individual payoff with no future consequences.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, stock, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        threshold = 0.75 * capacity
        k = 3  # Number of recent rounds to consider
        recent_history = history[-k:] if len(history) >= k else history
        recent_coop = sum(1 for action in recent_history if action == 'C') / len(recent_history)
        
        if stock > threshold and recent_coop >= 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**
- If the stock drops significantly below the threshold, players defect to exploit remaining resources.
- Players adapt quickly to changes in others' behavior, maintaining cooperation only when beneficial.

This strategy balances sustainability with self-interest, promoting long-term resource management while allowing exploitation when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_107 = '''
To address the challenge of sustainably managing a common resource among multiple players, we propose the following strategy:

**Strategy: Conditional Cooperation Based on Current Resource Level**

1. **Threshold Setting**: Establish a threshold (e.g., 75% of maximum capacity) to determine when cooperation is necessary to prevent resource depletion.

2. **Player Actions**:
   - **If current_stock > threshold**: Players defect, maximizing their gain while the resource is abundant.
   - **If current_stock ≤ threshold**: Players cooperate, minimizing consumption to allow the resource to recover and sustain future use.

3. **Rationale**:
   - Defecting when the resource is plentiful (above the threshold) allows players to benefit from higher yields without risking long-term depletion.
   - Cooperating when the resource is scarce ensures that it can replenish, preventing a tragedy of the commons scenario where overexploitation leads to irreversible loss.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Players independently assess the current stock level each round and adjust their strategy accordingly without needing communication or coordination.

5. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - The resource remains sustainable as cooperation curtails consumption when necessary, while defecting is permissible during periods of abundance.
   - This balance helps maintain the resource's health over time, preventing it from being exhausted by excessive exploitation.

By following this strategy, players can maximize their individual gains while collectively ensuring the resource's longevity.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_108 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance individual gains with collective sustainability, adapting based on current stock levels and opponents' behavior. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage sustainable resource management.
2. **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.
3. **Middle Rounds**:
   - **High Stock (Above 75% Capacity)**: Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - **Low Stock (Below 25% Capacity)**: Defect to salvage remaining resources.
   - **Moderate Stock**: Adjust based on recent cooperation rates among players:
     - If most players have been Cooperating, continue Cooperating to support resource recovery.
     - If many are Defecting, switch to Defecting to prevent exploitation and secure immediate gains.

### Decision Rules

- **First Round Action**:
  - Always Cooperate (C) to set a positive precedent for sustainability.

- **Last Round Action**:
  - Always Defect (D) to maximize payoff since there are no future consequences.

- **Middle Rounds Action**:
  - If current stock > 75% of capacity: Cooperate.
  - If current stock < 25% of capacity: Defect.
  - If stock is between 25% and 75%:
    - Calculate the proportion of Cooperators in recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds).
    - If more than 60% of players have been Cooperating: Continue Cooperating.
    - Else: Switch to Defecting.

        return 'C'
    elif current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    else:

                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages others to contribute sustainably.
- **Final Round Defection**: Maximizes immediate payoff when future rounds don't matter.
- **Threshold-Based Adjustments**: Balances individual gain with collective sustainability, adapting based on resource levels and opponents' actions.

This strategy aims to perform well against various opponent behaviors by dynamically adjusting actions based on observed conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_109 = '''
**Final Answer:**

The proposed collective strategy balances cooperation when resources are abundant and others cooperate with defection when resources are scarce or others defect. Here's a structured breakdown:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Sets a cooperative tone to prevent rapid resource depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the proportion of players who Defected in the previous round (`defection_rate`).
   - **Step 2:** Compute the current stock level as a percentage of capacity (`stock_pct = stock / capacity`).
   - **Decision Rules:**
     - If `stock_pct > 80%` AND `defection_rate < 30%`: Cooperate.
     - Otherwise (if `stock_pct ≤ 80%` OR `defection_rate ≥ 30%`): Defect.

**Rationale for Decision Rules:**
- **Cooperate:** Maintains a cooperative environment when resources are abundant and most players are cooperating, ensuring long-term sustainability.
- **Defect:** Encourages defection to either reduce personal consumption (when resources are low) or retaliate against defectors, promoting cooperation in future rounds.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to avoid immediate crashes.
- **Last Round:** Since the number of rounds is fixed but unknown, the strategy remains consistent across all rounds except the first.

This strategy aims to foster a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability, adapting to different scenarios by encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defection when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_110 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Threshold**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate (C) to maintain high stock levels and maximize collective payoffs.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Each player monitors the previous round's actions of all other players.
   - If all players Cooperated in the last round and the current stock is above 50% of capacity:
     - Continue to Cooperate (C).
   - Otherwise:
     - Switch to Defecting (D) for the next rounds until cooperation is observed again.

3. **Stock Threshold Adjustment:**
   - If the stock level drops below 50% of capacity, players switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoffs and prevent further resource depletion.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final 10% of rounds (i.e., last few rounds), players always Defect (D) to secure higher individual payoffs without concern for future sustainability.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Players consider the average action of others. If more than half of the players Cooperated, continue to Cooperate; otherwise, switch to Defecting.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players()
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    all_cooperated = True
    for action in history['others']:
        if action != 'C':
            all_cooperated = False
    
    stock_threshold = capacity * 0.5
    
    endgame_rounds = total_rounds * 0.1
    if round_number > (total_rounds - endgame_rounds):
        return 'D'
    
    if all_cooperated and current_stock >= stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy begins with cooperation to sustain the resource, ensuring stable payoffs.
- It dynamically adjusts by defecting if others defect or if the stock is critically low, preventing further depletion.
- In the endgame phase, players focus on maximizing immediate gains, reflecting a shift from long-term sustainability to short-term benefit.

This approach balances between fostering cooperation for sustainable outcomes and adaptively responding to defection or resource scarcity, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.

description_COLLECTIVE_111 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperative-Defection Strategy**

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoff while maintaining sustainability of the common pool resource through adaptive cooperation and controlled defection.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Start by conserving the resource to encourage growth for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the expected stock level if all players had Cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Step 2:** Compare this expected stock with the actual new_stock after consumption.
     - **If Actual Stock < Expected Stock:**
       - **Threshold Check:** If (Expected Stock - Actual Stock) > Defection Threshold, switch to Defect for the next x rounds.
     - **Else:**
       - Continue Cooperating.

3. **Endgame Rounds (Last y Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff as future rounds no longer impact sustainability.

### Adaptive Mechanisms:

- **Defection Threshold:** A predetermined value to detect significant defection by others, preventing false positives.
- **Response Period (x Rounds):** Duration to remain in Defect mode after detecting defection, allowing time for resource recovery or influencing others' behavior.
- **Endgame Trigger (y Rounds):** Switch to Defect in the final y rounds to capitalize on remaining resources.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(history):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    current_round = len(history) + 1

    # Initial Round Handling
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Calculate Expected Stock If All Cooperated
    previous_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    expected_consumption = n * (previous_stock / (2*n))
    expected_remaining = previous_stock - expected_consumption
    expected_growth = 2 * expected_remaining * (1 - expected_remaining/capacity)
    expected_new_stock = min(expected_remaining + expected_growth, capacity)

    # Actual Stock After Previous Round
    actual_new_stock = history[-1]['new_stock']

    # Defection Detection
    discrepancy = expected_new_stock - actual_new_stock
    if discrepancy > defection_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

    # Endgame Handling
    if current_round >= r - endgame_trigger + 1:
        return 'D'
```

### Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to start sustainably.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Switch to Defect to maximize immediate gains as future payoffs are irrelevant.

### Thresholds and Parameters:

- **Defection Threshold:** Set based on expected variance from cooperative play, ensuring responsiveness without overreacting.
- **Response Period (x):** Typically 2-3 rounds to allow for potential resource recovery or behavior adjustment.
- **Endgame Trigger (y):** Usually set as the last 5% of total rounds, promoting aggressive Defection in final stages.

### Rationale:

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by monitoring others' actions through stock changes. It adapts dynamically, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting strategically to prevent resource depletion. The endgame phase ensures maximum payoff utilization as the game concludes.

description_COLLECTIVE_112 = '''
To design a robust strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on balancing individual gain with collective sustainability. The strategy adapts dynamically based on the current state and rounds remaining, ensuring cooperation when sustainable and defecting when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to maintain resource levels.
2. **Dynamic Threshold for Cooperation:** Calculate a threshold based on remaining rounds and capacity. Cooperate if the stock is above this threshold; otherwise, defect.
3. **Adjustment for Sustainability:** Ensure that cooperation continues as long as it doesn't deplete resources beyond recovery.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, total_rounds, current_round):
    # Calculate required stock based on remaining rounds
    remaining_rounds = total_rounds - current_round + 1
    threshold = (capacity * remaining_rounds) / total_rounds
    
    # Ensure the threshold doesn't drop below 50% of capacity
    threshold = max(threshold, capacity * 0.5)
    
    if stock >= threshold:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"
```

### Edge Cases and Adjustments:
- **First Round:** Always cooperate since the stock is at full capacity.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Maintain a higher threshold to encourage cooperation until the end, preventing total depletion.

This strategy ensures that players contribute to resource sustainability while adapting to others' actions, promoting collective stability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_113 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round based on game parameters, state, and history, we've developed a strategic approach that balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

### Step 1: Initial Setup
- **First Round Action:** Start by Cooperating ('C') to promote a sustainable resource level.
- **Thresholds Definition:** 
  - `threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity` (e.g., 80% of maximum capacity).
  - `threshold_low = 0.6 * capacity` (e.g., 60% of maximum capacity).
  - A hysteresis effect is implemented to prevent oscillations, requiring a higher threshold to switch back from 'D' to 'C'.

### Step 2: Late Rounds Handling
- **Endgame Strategy:** In the last 5 rounds, always Defect ('D') to maximize immediate payoffs as there's no future benefit from Cooperating.

### Step 3: Decision Logic Based on Current Stock
1. **High Stock Levels (S > threshold_high):**
   - Continue Cooperating to maintain the resource and allow growth.
   
2. **Low Stock Levels (S < threshold_low):**
   - Switch to Defecting ('D') to maximize personal gain before potential depletion.

3. **Middle Range (threshold_low ≤ S ≤ threshold_high):**
   - **Recent Behavior Check:** Examine the cooperation rate of all players over the last 5 rounds.
     - If more than 70% have been Cooperating, continue Cooperating ('C') to support sustainability.
     - Otherwise, switch to Defecting ('D') to avoid being exploited.

### Step 4: Hysteresis Implementation
- To prevent frequent switching between 'C' and 'D', a hysteresis effect is applied. The strategy requires the stock level to exceed an even higher threshold (e.g., 85% of capacity) before reverting from 'D' back to 'C'.

### Step 5: Dynamic Adaptation
- The strategy dynamically adapts based on observed behavior and current resource levels, ensuring a balance between individual payoff maximization and collective resource sustainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(stock, history):
    global current_round, state
    capacity = 100  # Example capacity; replace with actual value if needed
    threshold_high = capacity * 0.8
    threshold_low = capacity * 0.6
    hysteresis_threshold = capacity * 0.85  # Higher than threshold_high for switching back to C

    current_round += 1
    rounds_remaining = r - current_round  # Assuming 'r' is the total number of rounds

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'

    if rounds_remaining < 5:
        return 'D'

    if state == 'C':
        if stock < threshold_low:
            state = 'D'
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Check recent cooperation rate
            recent_coop_rate = calculate_recent_coop(history[-5:])
            if recent_coop_rate > 0.7:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'  # Temporarily defect if others are not cooperating enough
    elif state == 'D':
        if stock > hysteresis_threshold:
            state = 'C'
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

def calculate_recent_coop(recent_history):
    n_coop = sum(1 for action in recent_history if action == 'C')
    return n_coop / len(recent_history) if recent_history else 0
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts by Cooperating to encourage a sustainable resource level.
- **Threshold-Based Decisions:** By using thresholds, the strategy adapts to current resource levels, switching to Defecting when resources are low and Cooperating when they're abundant.
- **Recent Behavior Adaptation:** Observing past actions helps decide whether others are Cooperating or not, influencing the decision to either continue Cooperating or start Defecting.
- **Hysteresis Effect:** Prevents oscillations by requiring a higher threshold before reverting from 'D' to 'C', ensuring stability in strategy.

This approach balances individual gain with collective sustainability, dynamically adapting to changing conditions and promoting cooperation when beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_114 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we must balance immediate gains against long-term sustainability. The strategy should encourage cooperation when beneficial but adapt to exploiters by defecting when necessary. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with Cooperate in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Use dynamic thresholds (HT and LT) based on historical stock levels and player behavior to decide actions.
3. **Adaptation Based on Stock Levels**:
   - Cooperate if the stock is above a high threshold (HT) and cooperation is prevalent.
   - Defect if the stock drops below HT or a significant number of players defect, indicating overuse risk.
4. **Adjust Thresholds Dynamically**: Modify thresholds after each round considering stock growth and past actions to maintain optimal resource levels.

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If stock > HT and proportion of cooperators in recent rounds is above a certain level: Cooperate.
   - Else: Defect to maximize individual gain while resources last.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round Known**: Defect to grab remaining resources.
   - **Stock Near Capacity**: Cooperate to sustain growth.

### Pseudocode

```python
initialize:
    cooperation = True
    HT = capacity * 0.8  # Example threshold
    LT = capacity * 0.2
    recent_defectors = []

for each round in rounds:
    if current_round == first_round:
        play Cooperate
    else:
        stock_level = get_current_stock()
        proportion_defectors = count(recent_defectors) / n

        if stock_level > HT and proportion_defectors < 0.3:
            play Cooperate
        else:
            play Defect

    update_thresholds(stock_level, past_actions)
    recent_defectors.update(get_opponents_last_round_actions())

def update_thresholds(stock_level, past_actions):
    global HT, LT
    growth = calculate_growth(stock_level - total_consumption)
    if growth > average_growth:
        HT *= 1.05  # Increase threshold slightly
        LT *= 1.02
    else:
        HT *= 0.95  # Decrease threshold to be cautious
        LT *= 0.98

def calculate_growth(stock_remaining):
    return 2 * stock_remaining * (1 - stock_remaining / capacity)
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Sets a positive precedent and encourages others to maintain the resource.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust based on historical data to ensure sustainability without rigid constraints.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Balances cooperation and defection, adapting to both resource levels and opponents' actions.

This strategy aims to maximize long-term payoffs by fostering cooperation while protecting against exploitation, ensuring adaptability across various game dynamics.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_115 = '''
Each player assesses the current stock of the resource. They cooperate if the stock is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity) and defect otherwise.

**Answer:**

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the current stock is above a certain threshold; otherwise, defect.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_116 = '''
**Strategy Outline for Managing Shared Resources:**

1. **Initial State**: Start by Cooperating to foster an environment conducive to shared resource management.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Assess the cooperation rate from the previous round (number of Cooperators divided by total players).
   - If the current stock level is above a high threshold (e.g., 80% capacity), continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock level is below this threshold but the cooperation rate exceeds a moderate threshold (e.g., 60%), Cooperate to encourage others and maintain resource health.
   - If neither condition is met, switch to Defecting to signal dissatisfaction with low cooperation and potential exploitation.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - In the final round, always Cooperate to preserve any Cooperative progress made throughout the game.
   - If the stock level drops below a critical low threshold (e.g., 20% capacity), revert to Cooperating to attempt resource rebuilding, regardless of current cooperation rates.

4. **State Transitions**:
   - Incorporate hysteresis by setting higher thresholds for returning to Cooperation after defecting to prevent oscillations and provide time for others to adjust their strategies.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging Cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation. It adapts dynamically based on current conditions and past behaviors, aiming to maintain resource health and foster a Cooperative environment over time.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_117 = '''
To address this problem, we've developed a strategic approach for an AI player participating in a repeated common-pool resource game. The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to the observed health of the shared resource.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same, fostering growth.
2. **Adaptive Strategy Based on Stock Health**:
   - **Cooperate** if the average stock level over the past few rounds is above a high threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity).
   - **Defect** if the average drops below a lower threshold (e.g., 70%) to signal concern or prevent further depletion.
3. **Hysteresis Mechanism**: Maintain the current strategy within an intermediate range (between 70% and 90%) to avoid unnecessary oscillations, ensuring stability.

This approach uses observable data about the stock's health to make informed decisions without relying on knowledge of other players' strategies, making it robust for a tournament setting.

### Solution Code
```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "SustainablePlayer"
        self.cooperate_count = 0
        self.defect_count = 0
        self.stock_history = []
        self.current_strategy = 'C'  # Start with Cooperate

    def action(self, history):
        if not history:
            return 'C'
        
        # Keep track of the last few rounds' stock levels
        recent_stock = history[-1]['stock']
        self.stock_history.append(recent_stock)
        # Consider average over past 3 rounds or all available if less than 3
        lookback = min(len(self.stock_history), 3)
        avg_stock = sum(self.stock_history[-lookback:]) / lookback
        
        capacity = 100.0  # Assuming capacity is 100 based on examples
        high_threshold = 0.9 * capacity
        low_threshold = 0.7 * capacity

        if self.current_strategy == 'C':
            if avg_stock < low_threshold:
                self.current_strategy = 'D'
        else:  # current strategy is D
            if avg_stock > high_threshold:
                self.current_strategy = 'C'

        return self.current_strategy
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The player starts with a cooperative stance to promote resource growth.
- **Stock Monitoring**: Tracks the average stock level over recent rounds to assess sustainability.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Switches between Cooperating and Defecting based on predefined thresholds, ensuring actions align with the current health of the resource.
- **Stability Through Hysteresis**: Avoids frequent changes by maintaining strategies within an intermediate range, enhancing overall stability.

This strategy effectively balances immediate rewards with future sustainability, encouraging others to participate cooperatively while safeguarding against resource depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_118 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a balance between cooperation and defection while considering the resource's health and future sustainability, we propose the following strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first round to establish a foundation for sustaining the resource.

2. **Adaptive Behavior Based on Past Actions**:
   - For each subsequent round (from 2 to r-2), assess the previous round's cooperation rate and current stock level.
     - If more than half of the players cooperated in the last round, and the current stock is above 75% of capacity, continue to cooperate.
     - Otherwise, defect to prevent resource depletion.

3. **Final Rounds Adjustment**:
   - In the last two rounds (r-1 and r), prioritize cooperation over defection. This aims to sustain the resource for any potential future play beyond the given rounds, despite the temptation to defect in the final round for immediate gain.

4. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - Use thresholds (75% stock level) and majority cooperation (e.g., >50%) as triggers for cooperative behavior, ensuring sustainability while adapting to others' actions.

This strategy aims to foster a self-reinforcing loop of cooperation when sustainable and defect only when necessary, balancing immediate gains with long-term resource health.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_119 = '''
The optimal strategy for managing the resource sustainably while maximizing individual payoffs involves a balanced approach where players defect when the stock is abundant and cooperate to allow recovery when the stock is depleted. Here's how it can be structured:

**Strategy:**

1. **Defect When Stock is Abundant:** Players should defect (harvest more) when the current stock level exceeds 75% of the capacity. This allows them to take advantage of the plentiful resource without causing immediate depletion.

2. **Cooperate for Recovery:** When the stock is between 25% and 75% of capacity, players should cooperate by harvesting less. This helps preserve the resource and allows it to replenish over time, ensuring sustainability.

3. **Scavenge When Stock is Low:** If the stock drops below 25% of capacity, players should defect again, as the resource is already severely depleted. At this point, players aim to salvage what they can before the resource collapses entirely.

**Implementation:**

- Players continuously monitor the current stock level.
- Based on the stock level, each player independently decides whether to defect or cooperate using the thresholds defined above.

**Example Walkthrough:**

For a system with `n=4` and `capacity=100`:

- **Initial State (Round 1):**
  - Stock = 100 (75% of capacity is 75).
  - Since 100 > 75, all players defect.
  - Each player's payoff: 25
  - Total consumption: 100 → Stock drops to 0.

- **Round 2:**
  - Stock = 0 (below 25%).
  - Players defect again.
  - Payoff: 0 for all players.

This example illustrates a potential flaw where immediate depletion occurs if all players defect in the first round. To mitigate this, consider adjusting thresholds or incorporating additional strategies to prevent such collapses. However, under the given constraints, this strategy provides a framework for balancing individual gains and resource sustainability.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is for each player to defect when the stock exceeds 75% of capacity, cooperate between 25% and 75%, and defect again below 25%. This balances harvesting with preservation. The final answer is:

$\boxed{\text{Defect if } S > 0.75C, \text{ Cooperate if } 0.25C \leq S \leq 0.75C, \text{ Defect if } S < 0.25C}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_120 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource level while allowing for strategic defection, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both current stock levels and historical player behavior.

### Approach
The strategy involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players cooperate to ensure the resource is not immediately depleted.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: For subsequent rounds:
   - Players check if the current stock level is below half of the capacity (`c/2`). If so, they cooperate to prevent further depletion.
   - If the current stock is above `c/2`, players assess the historical behavior of other participants by calculating the average defection rate over previous rounds. If this rate exceeds 50%, indicating a tendency towards resource depletion, players switch to cooperation to aid recovery.

This approach balances immediate gains from defection with the need for long-term sustainability through cooperation, creating a feedback loop that encourages responsible behavior among participants.

### Solution Code
```python

    """

        round_number (int): Current round number.
        past_actions (list of lists): Each sublist contains actions ('C' or 'D') taken by all players in each previous round.
    
    Returns:
        str: 'C' for Cooperate, 'D' for Defect
    """
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate average defection rate across all past rounds and players
        total_defectors = sum([sum(1 for action in actions if action == 'D') for actions in past_actions])
        total_actions = len(past_actions) * len(past_actions[0])  # assuming same number of players each round
        avg_defection_rate = total_defectors / total_actions if total_actions != 0 else 0
        
        # Cooperate if current stock is below half capacity or if defection rate is high
        if current_stock < capacity / 2 or avg_defection_rate >= 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts with cooperation in the first round to ensure the resource isn't immediately depleted.
- **Stock Threshold Check**: If the current stock is below half of its capacity, players cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow recovery.
- **Defection Rate Analysis**: Players evaluate historical behavior by calculating the average defection rate. A high defection rate (50% or more) prompts cooperation to stabilize the resource level.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging responsible behavior among participants through adaptive decision-making based on current conditions and past actions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_121 = '''
To address the problem of balancing resource exploitation with sustainability in a repeated game setting, we propose a strategic approach that adapts to both current conditions and historical behavior. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while preventing a tragedy of the commons.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Round Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to establish a sustainable resource base.
2. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
3. **Penultimate Round Adjustment**: If nearing the end, cooperate only if the stock is sufficiently high; otherwise, defect.
4. **Middle Rounds Adaptation**:
   - Monitor others' recent actions to detect exploitation trends.
   - Cooperate if others are predominantly cooperative and the resource level is healthy.
   - Defect if excessive exploitation by others or low resource levels threaten sustainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, others_history):
    cooperation_threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # Example threshold
    defection_threshold = 0.5               # If >50% defect recently, defect
    
    if round_number == 1:

    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'

            if current_stock > cooperation_threshold:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            recent_defects = count_defects(others_history, window=5)
            proportion_D = recent_defects / len(others_history[-5:])
            
            if proportion_D > defection_threshold or current_stock < cooperation_threshold:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, the strategy promotes resource sustainability and mutual benefit.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Recognizing no future repercussions, defecting maximizes immediate gain.
- **Penultimate Adjustment**: A balance between maintaining resources for the final round if possible and exploiting when necessary.
- **Adaptive Behavior in Middle Rounds**: By monitoring others' actions and the resource level, the strategy dynamically adapts to prevent being exploited while sustaining the resource when beneficial.

This approach balances individual self-interest with collective sustainability, adapting to exploit opportunities while mitigating risks of resource depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_122 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource while responding to other players' actions, we can implement a dynamic strategy that adapts based on both the current state of the resource and recent cooperation trends among players.

### Approach
The approach involves:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to signal willingness to maintain sustainability.
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Use two thresholds for the stock level:
   - High threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
   - Low threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
3. **Recent Cooperation Rate**: Calculate the average proportion of Cooperators over recent rounds to gauge current cooperation levels.
4. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - If the stock is above the high threshold and recent cooperation is high, continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock is between thresholds, adjust based on moderate cooperation rates.
   - If the stock drops below the low threshold or cooperation rates are too low, switch to Defecting.

### Solution Code
```python
def decision_round(current_stock, capacity, n_players, previous_actions=None):
    if previous_actions is None:
        # First round: Cooperate
        return 'C'
    
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    recent_coop_rate = calculate_recent_coop_rate(previous_actions)
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        if recent_coop_rate >= 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    elif low_threshold <= current_stock <= high_threshold:
        if recent_coop_rate >= 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        # Stock below low threshold: Defect
        return 'D'

def calculate_recent_coop_rate(previous_actions):
    total_coop = sum(1 for round_act in previous_actions for act in round_act if act == 'C')
    total_players = len(previous_actions[0]) * len(previous_actions)
    return total_coop / total_players
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with Cooperate to encourage sustainability.
- **Thresholds**: Two thresholds (75% and 50% of capacity) help determine the resource's health. High cooperation is expected when the stock is robust.
- **Recent Cooperation Rate**: By analyzing recent actions, the strategy adapts to changing behaviors. If others Cooperate less, it becomes more likely to Defect.
- **Dynamic Response**: The approach dynamically adjusts between Cooperating and Defecting based on both resource levels and observed cooperation trends, balancing sustainability with responsiveness.

This strategy is designed to maintain a healthy stock level while adapting to the actions of other players, promoting a sustainable equilibrium.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_123 = '''
To address the problem, I propose a strategy that balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by monitoring both past actions and current stock levels. The strategy adapts based on observed cooperation rates and stock thresholds to encourage collective cooperation while defending against defectors.

---

**Strategy Description:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and sustain the resource.

2. **Adaptive Cooperation Based on Recent History:**
   - For each subsequent round:
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate among all players over the last 5 rounds (or fewer if less history is available).
     - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity AND the recent cooperation rate exceeds 60%, continue Cooperating.
     - Otherwise, switch to Defecting (D) to either salvage higher immediate payoffs or respond to perceived exploitation.

3. **Defection in Response to Low Stock:**
   - If the current stock falls below 80% of capacity, players prioritize maximizing their immediate payoff by defecting, anticipating potential resource depletion regardless of others' actions.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment to Cooperation Trends:**
   - Players continuously monitor cooperation rates and adjust their strategies accordingly, reinforcing collective behavior when sustainable and switching tactics when necessary.

---

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, capacity):
    n = number_of_players
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    lookback = min(5, len(history))
    total_cooperations = sum(1 for actions in history[-lookback:] for action in actions if action == 'C')
    cooperation_rate = total_cooperations / (n * lookback)
    
    capacity_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    
    if current_stock >= capacity_threshold and cooperation_rate > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

---

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate a cooperative environment.
- **Last Rounds (Unknown):** The strategy doesn't rely on knowing the end, focusing instead on current and past rounds to decide actions adaptively.

---

This strategy aims to sustain cooperation when viable while protecting against exploitation by defecting when necessary. By dynamically adjusting based on observed behavior and resource levels, it promotes collective stability while being resilient to various opponent strategies.

   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Rationale: Maintain or grow the stock by consuming less, encouraging others to do the same.
   - **Observation:** Note the number of players defecting and their impact on stock levels.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Cooperation Condition:**
     - Continue cooperating if most players have cooperated in previous rounds.
     - Rationale: Sustain resource levels for future gains.
   - **Defection Condition:**
     - Switch to defecting if a significant number of players (e.g., >50%) have defected in recent rounds.
     - Rationale: Prevent exploitation and maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Rationale: No future rounds to consider, so prioritize maximizing immediate gain.

4. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate if stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) or when majority cooperate.
   - Defect if stock is low, many defect, or near the end.

5. **Adaptation:**
   - Gradually adjust behavior based on recent outcomes and others' actions to prevent exploitation.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock_level, history):
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if near the end
    if round_number >= (total_rounds - 2):
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate in recent rounds
    recent_coop = sum(1 for action in history[-5:] if action == 'C') / len(history[-5:])
    
    # If majority recently cooperated, cooperate
    if recent_coop > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check stock level threshold
    if stock_level > 0.7 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to others' behavior and resource levels.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Strategy Overview:**
The strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting player behavior based on the current stock level and historical interactions. It encourages cooperation when sustainable and switches to defection when necessary to prevent resource depletion.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to maintain a healthy initial stock level, promoting future growth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to the maximum capacity.
   - If the stock is above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating to sustain high payoffs and encourage resource replenishment.
   - If the stock drops below 80%, consider switching to Defecting to maximize immediate gain while preventing further depletion.

3. **Final Rounds (Last Few Rounds):**
   - Tend towards Defection as there are fewer future rounds, reducing incentives for long-term cooperation.

**Adaptive Mechanisms:**

- **Threshold Adjustment:** Adjust the 80% threshold based on historical performance. If cooperation leads to stable stock levels and high payoffs, maintain or raise the threshold. If cooperation fails, lower the threshold to prevent depletion.
  
- **Buffer Zone:** Introduce a buffer around the threshold where players use a mixed strategy (random Cooperate/Defect) to handle uncertainty near the threshold.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Stock at Threshold:** Use the buffer zone for a smooth transition between cooperation and defection, avoiding abrupt changes.
- **Mixed Strategies:** When some players defect while others cooperate, adapt by adjusting thresholds and strategies dynamically to respond to varying player behaviors.

**Implementation Summary:**
The strategy adapts based on observable game state information, encouraging cooperation when sustainable and defecting when necessary. It uses feedback mechanisms to adjust thresholds and employs a buffer zone for smoother transitions, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors without requiring communication or coordination.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to balance individual payoffs with the collective good, ensuring sustainable use of the common pool resource. It is designed to adapt based on current stock levels and historical cooperation rates, promoting stability and recovery.

---

### **Strategy Overview**

1. **Cooperation Threshold:** Players Cooperate (C) when the current stock is above 75% of capacity, ensuring sustainable consumption and allowing for stock recovery.
2. **Adaptive Defection for Recovery:** When the stock falls below 75%, players may defect less aggressively to aid in recovery while still seeking some payoff.
3. **Learning from History:** Players adjust their strategies based on past cooperation rates observed among others, encouraging continued cooperation if sufficient numbers are doing so.

---

### **Detailed Strategy Components**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - All players Cooperate (C) to maintain the stock at its initial level and set a positive precedent for future rounds.

2. **Cooperation Threshold (75% of Capacity):**
   - If current stock > 0.75 × capacity:
     - Cooperate (C) to sustainably consume resources, allowing growth.
   - This ensures that when the resource is abundant, players contribute to its stability.

3. **Stock Below 75%:**
   - Players evaluate historical cooperation rates from previous rounds:
     - If cooperation rate among others was high in recent rounds:
       - Cooperate (C) to support stock recovery and maintain sustainability.
     - If cooperation rate was low:
       - Defect (D), but consider defecting less aggressively to avoid excessive depletion. This might involve a reduced consumption rate or cautious defection.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others to do the same, fostering a cooperative environment.
   - **Last Round:** Continue Cooperating to prevent a sudden collapse and ensure some payoff without over-depletion.

5. **Feedback Loop and History Adjustment:**
   - Players monitor past cooperation rates (e.g., proportion of Cs from other players) and adjust their strategy accordingly:
     - High cooperation in previous rounds reinforces current Cooperation.
     - Low cooperation may prompt more cautious behavior or limited Defection to prevent collapse.

6. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Consider trends in stock levels over multiple rounds. If the stock is increasing despite some Defectors, it signals that enough are Cooperating for recovery, allowing others to cautiously defect without harming sustainability.

---

### **Pseudocode Representation**

```python
for each player i in {1, ..., n}:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(history)
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
        # Cooperate when stock is above threshold
        return 'C'
    else:
        if cooperation_rate > threshold_coop_rate:
            # High cooperation observed; cooperate to support recovery
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Consider defecting less aggressively or cautiously defecting
            return 'D'  # Could be modified based on additional factors like stock trends
```

---

### **Conclusion**

This strategy promotes sustainability by Cooperating when the resource is abundant and adaptively adjusting behavior based on past cooperation rates. It encourages collective responsibility, helping to maintain the common pool resource while allowing players to secure reasonable payoffs. By balancing individual gains with long-term sustainability, this approach aims to achieve a stable equilibrium in the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_127 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on current stock levels, recent player behavior, and the number of rounds remaining. This approach ensures adaptability while promoting sustainability.

### Strategy Overview

The strategy is designed to foster cooperation when it's sustainable and switches to defection when necessary or nearing the end of the game. It uses observable state variables (stock level, past actions) to dynamically adjust each player's decision.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Rounds (First 5% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Reasoning:** Establish a healthy stock base to support sustainability and growth in subsequent rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds (Until the last 10% of rounds):**
   - **Step A:** Calculate the average cooperation rate from the past `k` rounds.
   - **Step B:** If the current stock is above 70% of capacity (`stock_threshold`) and the average cooperation rate is above 60% (`coop_threshold`), Cooperate.
   - **Else:** Defect
   - **Reasoning:** Continue supporting sustainability when others are cooperating and the resource is healthy. Switch to defection if cooperation levels drop or the resource is strained.

3. **Last 10% of Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Reasoning:** Maximize individual gains in the final rounds since future rounds no longer matter.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    if round_number <= initial_cooperate_rounds:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number > (total_rounds - endgame_defect_rounds):
        return 'D'
    else:
        recent_history = get_last_k_rounds(history, k)
        avg_coop = calculate_average_cooperation(recent_history)
        if current_stock / capacity >= stock_threshold and avg_coop >= coop_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Parameters
initial_cooperate_rounds = total_rounds * 0.05
endgame_defect_rounds = total_rounds * 0.10
k = 3  # Number of recent rounds to consider
stock_threshold = 0.7  # 70% of capacity
coop_threshold = 0.6   # 60% cooperation rate
```

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to start sustainably.
- **Low Stock:** If stock drops below the threshold despite attempts, players might defect cautiously to avoid collapse.
- **Endgame:** Focus on maximizing individual gains since future rounds are limited.

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset valuing long-term sustainability while remaining flexible.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_128 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability in a resource management scenario, we propose a strategic approach that adapts based on observed stock levels and others' actions. Here's the structured explanation:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff while maintaining the resource for future gains. It employs thresholds to decide between cooperation and defection based on the current state of the resource.

### Decision-Making Process:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone, encouraging others to follow suit and contribute to sustainable resource management.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1: Observe Stock Levels Post-Growth:**
     - After each round, note the new stock level after consumption and growth.
   
   - **Step 2: Evaluate Stock Against Thresholds:**
     - **High Threshold (e.g., ≥80% of capacity):** If the stock is above this threshold, continue Cooperating. The resource is sustainably managed, ensuring future gains.
     - **Moderate Levels (50%-80% of capacity):** Assess others' cooperation in the previous round:
       - If most players Cooperated, continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability.
       - If many Defected, consider switching to Defecting to avoid exploitation and maximize immediate payoff.
     - **Low Threshold (<50% of capacity):** Switch to Defecting. The resource is critically depleted; defecting maximizes immediate payoff before potential collapse.

3. **Final Round(s):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Even in the last round, cooperation ensures higher payoffs from potential growth before final consumption, benefiting all players collectively.

### Conclusion:
This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to the resource's state and others' behaviors. It promotes cooperation when resources are healthy and switches to defection when necessary to prevent over-depletion, ensuring a fair balance between individual and collective benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_129 = '''
**Dynamic Threshold Strategy (DyThS)**

This strategy adapts based on the remaining rounds and current stock level, encouraging cooperation for sustainability while switching to defection as resources dwindle or nearing the game's conclusion.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to start sustainably and build a stable resource base.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the proportion of the current stock relative to capacity.
   - Adjust cooperation thresholds based on the number of remaining rounds:
     - High threshold (75%) when more than half of the game remains.
     - Medium threshold (60%) as rounds progress into the middle third.
     - Low threshold (40%) in the final third of the game.

3. **Endgame Handling:**
   - In the last few rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoffs since there's no future benefit from cooperation.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, remaining_rounds, total_rounds):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if remaining_rounds == total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    prop = stock / capacity
    
    # Determine dynamic threshold based on remaining rounds
    if remaining_rounds > (2 * total_rounds) / 3:
        threshold = 0.75
    elif remaining_rounds > total_rounds / 3:
        threshold = 0.60
    else:
        threshold = 0.40
    
    # If in last few rounds, defect regardless
    if remaining_rounds <= 2:
        return 'D'
    
    if prop >= threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Strategy Explanation:

- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The strategy uses a sliding scale for cooperation thresholds. As the game progresses, players become more cautious, lowering their willingness to cooperate to prevent resource depletion.
  
- **Endgame Handling:** Recognizing that the final rounds offer no future benefits from sustainability, players defect to maximize immediate gains.

This approach balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and encouraging collective behavior that prevents over-depletion while maximizing individual payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_130 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with adaptive responses based on the state of the common pool resource and historical consumption patterns. This strategy is designed to promote sustainability while deterring excessive exploitation.

### Strategy Design:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Start with Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline and encourage sustainable resource use.

2. **Sustainability Threshold:**
   - Define a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) below which cooperation may not be sustainable.
   - Continue Cooperating if the stock remains above this threshold.

3. **Adaptive Defection for Conservation:**
   - If the stock falls below the threshold or shows rapid depletion, switch to Defect in subsequent rounds to signal the need for conservation and deter overconsumption.

4. **Reversion to Cooperation:**
   - After a period of defection, revert to Cooperate if stock levels recover, encouraging others to follow suit.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Consider defecting to maximize immediate payoff, but weigh against the risk of crashing the resource.
   - **Mid-Game Adjustment:** Continuously monitor trends and adjust actions based on current stock health.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_history, consumption_patterns):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    
    # Check if stock is below threshold or rapidly decreasing
    if (current_stock < threshold) or (is_rapidly_decreasing(stock_history)):
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Consider recent consumption patterns
        if many_defectors(consumption_patterns):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def is_rapidly_decreasing(stock_history):
    # Calculate rate of change over last few rounds
    pass

def many_defectors(consumption_patterns):
    # Determine if a significant number of players defected recently
    pass
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages others to maintain the resource, setting a positive precedent.
- **Threshold Monitoring:** Prevents stock depletion by signaling when conservation is needed.
- **Adaptive Defection:** Deters excessive exploitation while encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Reversion Mechanism:** Promotes long-term sustainability by reverting to cooperation once conditions improve.

This strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to both cooperative and defective behaviors of other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_131 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperate-Defect**

This strategy balances individual exploitation with collective resource maintenance by adjusting actions based on current stock levels and trends.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

Players decide to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) each round based on the following rules:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C). This helps maintain a high initial stock for future rounds.
   
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If current stock \( S > 0.8 \times \text{capacity} \): Defect (D) to exploit the abundant resource.
   - If current stock \( S < 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \): Cooperate (C) to allow regrowth and prevent collapse.
   - **Between thresholds (0.5–0.8 × capacity)**:
     - Check if the stock has decreased compared to two rounds ago.
     - If yes: Cooperate (C) to rebuild the resource.
     - If no: Defect (D) as the resource is stable or increasing.

3. **Last Round**: Always Defect (D). Since there are no future consequences, maximize individual gain.

---

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round**: Cooperation ensures a high starting stock.
- **Stock Near Capacity**: Defection is safe due to abundance.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Cooperation prevents collapse and enables regrowth.

---

### **3. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
threshold_low = 0.5 * capacity

for t in range(1, r + 1):
    if t == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock(t)
        if current_stock > threshold_high:
            action = 'D'
        elif current_stock < threshold_low:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            # Check trend compared to two rounds ago
            stock_two_rounds_ago = get_stock(t - 2)
            if current_stock < stock_two_rounds_ago:
                action = 'C'  # Cooperate to rebuild
            else:
                action = 'D'  # Defect as stable or increasing
    # Enforce defect in the last round
    if t == r:
        action = 'D'
    set_action(t, action)
```

---

### **4. Rationale**

- **Initial Cooperation**: Preserves the resource for future exploitation.
- **Defection at High Levels**: Maximizes individual gain when the resource is abundant and less likely to collapse.
- **Cooperation at Low Levels**: Prevents irreversible depletion, allowing the resource to recover.
- **Trend-Based Adjustment**: Responds dynamically to others' actions, switching strategies based on whether the stock is decreasing or stable.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_132 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**
Maximize total payoff over all rounds by balancing immediate gains with preserving the resource for future use, while adapting to opponents' behaviors.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Build a cooperative history and encourage others to do the same, fostering mutual preservation of the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate opponents' cooperation rate.
     - `opponent_coop_rate = (number of opponent Cooperations) / total_opponent_actions`
   - Determine current stock level relative to capacity.
   - Adjust actions based on thresholds:
     - If `opponent_coop_rate > threshold1` and `current_stock_level > safe_threshold`: Defect
     - Else: Cooperate

3. **Endgame (Last 10% of rounds):**
   - Gradually increase defection likelihood as future rounds matter less.
   - Adjust thresholds to allow more Defection towards the end.

4. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - `safe_threshold = capacity * 0.6`
     - If stock is above this, consider allowing limited Defection.
   - `danger_zone = capacity * 0.3`
     - Below this, enforce Cooperate to aid recovery.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

1. **First Round:**
   - Default to Cooperate as no history is available.

2. **Stock Near Capacity or Zero:**
   - If stock > `capacity * 0.8`: Allow cautious Defection.
   - If stock < `danger_zone`: Enforce Cooperate to prevent collapse.

3. **Last Few Rounds:**
   - Use a sliding scale where the likelihood of Defect increases as rounds near completion, balancing immediate gains with minimal future impact.

---

### **Pseudocode**

```python
def decision_rule(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, opponent_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate opponent cooperation rate
    total_opponent_actions = sum(len(actions) for actions in opponent_actions)
    if total_opponent_actions == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    opponent_coop_count = sum(1 for actions in opponent_actions for a in actions if a == 'C')
    opponent_coop_rate = opponent_coop_count / total_opponent_actions
    
    # Define thresholds
    safe_threshold = capacity * 0.6
    danger_zone = capacity * 0.3
    threshold1 = 0.75  # Cooperate rate needed to allow Defection
    
    # Endgame adjustment
    if round_number > (total_rounds - total_rounds // 10):
        endgame_weight = ((round_number - (total_rounds - total_rounds // 10)) / (total_rounds // 10)) * 0.5 + 0.5
        threshold1 *= endgame_weight
    
    # Decision logic
    if opponent_coop_rate > threshold1 and current_stock > safe_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

---

### **Rationale**

- **Building Cooperation:** Starting with Cooperate sets a positive precedent, encouraging others to preserve the resource.
- **Adaptability:** By adjusting based on opponents' cooperation rates and stock levels, the strategy dynamically balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability.
- **Risk Management:** Thresholds prevent over-exploitation, ensuring the resource remains viable for future rounds unless endgame dynamics justify more risk.

This approach aims to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining a sustainable resource level through adaptive cooperation and cautious defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_133 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining cooperation while avoiding over-depletion in a repeated resource game, we propose a threshold-based strategy that adapts based on observed stock levels. Here's a structured summary:

### Strategy: Threshold-Based Cooperation with Hysteresis

1. **Initialization**:
   - **State**: Begin in State A (Cooperate).
   - **Thresholds**:
     - Lower Threshold (X): 80% of capacity.
     - Upper Threshold (Y): 90% of capacity.
   - **Endgame Handling**: Defect in the last few rounds to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Decision Process for Each Round**:
   - If within the final 3 rounds, defect.
   - Else:
     - **State A (Cooperate)**:
       - Check if current stock (S) < X.
         - If yes: Switch to State B (Defect).
         - Else: Continue Cooperating.
     - **State B (Defect)**:
       - Check if S > Y.
         - If yes: Revert to State A (Cooperate).
         - Else: Continue Defecting.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Always Cooperate in the first round to set a positive precedent.
   - Handle stock exactly at X or Y by using inclusive checks.
   - If stock reaches zero, remain in Defect state until recovery above Y is observed.

### Rationale

- **Thresholds**: The thresholds (80% and 90%) provide clear decision points. Cooperating when the stock is high maintains sustainability, while defecting when it's low prevents over-depletion.
- **Hysteresis**: Prevents rapid state switches due to minor fluctuations near the thresholds, ensuring stability in strategy choice.
- **Endgame Handling**: Recognizes that cooperation is less likely in final rounds, so defecting maximizes short-term gain.

This approach balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, dynamically adapting to other players' actions without requiring communication. It encourages cooperation when possible and switches to defection when necessary, maintaining resilience against various player behaviors.

### Final Answer

The optimal strategy is a threshold-based approach where you cooperate if the current stock exceeds 80% of capacity and defect otherwise, with hysteresis to avoid oscillation. This strategy ensures sustainable resource use while adapting to others' actions. The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when the stock exceeds 80%, else defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_134 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability. The strategy is designed to be robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors while maximizing collective payoff over multiple rounds.

---

### **Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation and Defection (ACD)**

The ACD strategy adapts based on the current stock level, historical trends, and previous actions' outcomes. It prioritizes cooperation when the resource is at risk to ensure sustainability but allows defection when the resource is abundant or when other players' actions indicate a need for increased immediate payoff.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to conserve the resource and encourage others to follow suit.
   - Monitor stock dynamics and adjust subsequent decisions based on observed trends.

2. **Current Stock Thresholds:**
   - **High Stock (S > 0.8 * capacity):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as the resource is resilient and can recover even after high consumption.
   - **Medium Stock (0.4 * capacity < S ≤ 0.8 * capacity):** 
     - Cooperate if the stock has been decreasing over recent rounds or if previous rounds indicate high defection by others.
     - Defect otherwise, balancing immediate gains with sustainability concerns.
   - **Low Stock (S ≤ 0.4 * capacity):** Cooperate to preserve the resource and allow it to recover.

3. **Stock Trend Analysis:**
   - Track the stock's trend over the last few rounds.
   - If the stock is consistently decreasing despite cooperation, switch to cooperation in subsequent rounds to encourage recovery.
   - If the stock remains stable or increases after defection, continue defecting cautiously.

4. **Last Few Rounds (Final 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Gradually increase defection to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are limited.
   - Avoid excessive depletion that could reduce payoffs in the final round.

5. **Responsive Adjustment:**
   - If other players' actions lead to rapid stock depletion, switch to cooperation to mitigate further damage.
   - Adjust defecting levels based on observed trends in stock growth and consumption patterns.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    current_round = get_current_round()

    low_threshold = 0.4 * capacity
    medium_high = 0.8 * capacity
    
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to set a positive precedent
    if current_round <= 2:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check stock level relative to thresholds
    if current_stock <= low_threshold:
        return 'C'  # Preserve resource for recovery
    elif current_stock > medium_high:

    # Medium stock: Analyze trend and previous actions

    if recent_stock_trend < -0.1 * capacity:  # Stock decreasing significantly

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to encourage others to conserve the resource.
- **Last Round(s):** Gradually increase defection to maximize immediate payoffs, but avoid excessive depletion that could harm the final round's payoff for everyone.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Feel confident in defecting as the resource is abundant and can recover even after high consumption.

---

### **Conclusion**

The ACD strategy dynamically adapts to current conditions, balancing cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection for immediate gains. By monitoring stock levels, analyzing trends, and responding to others' actions, this strategy aims to maximize collective payoff while ensuring the resource remains viable over multiple rounds. This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors and promotes a balance between individual and collective interests.

The optimal strategy for the AI in managing resource collection while considering potential depletion involves balancing between higher individual payoffs from defecting and preserving the resource by cooperating. Given the risk of immediate depletion when defecting at high stock levels, a cautious approach is recommended.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Assess Current Stock Level:** Evaluate the current stock level relative to its capacity.
2. **Set a Threshold:** Define a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) above which defecting is considered safe without causing rapid depletion.
3. **Decision Making:**
   - If the current stock is below the threshold, cooperate to preserve resources and allow growth.
   - If the stock is above the threshold, defect to gain higher payoffs while ensuring it doesn't lead to significant resource depletion.

**Answer:**

The AI should Cooperate when the current stock level is below a certain high threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) to prevent depletion and promote resource growth. When the stock is above this threshold, it can safely Defect to gain higher payoffs without risking severe resource decline. This balanced approach helps maintain sustainable resource levels while allowing for occasional increased gains.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock level is below 75% of capacity; otherwise, defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_136 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource level while maximizing individual payoff, we employ a threshold strategy based on the current stock level relative to capacity.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Observe Current Stock (S_t):** At each round, check the current stock level S_t.

2. **Set Threshold (T):** Define a threshold T as 75% of the capacity (e.g., T = 0.75 * capacity).

3. **Decision Rule:**
   - If S_t ≥ T, choose to Cooperate (C). This helps maintain sustainable resource levels.
   - If S_t < T, switch to Defecting (D). This is a protective measure to prevent overexploitation and potential crashes.

4. **Rationale:**
   - Cooperating when the stock is sufficient ensures moderate consumption and allows for regrowth, maintaining long-term sustainability.
   - Defecting when the stock is low prevents severe depletion, though it risks short-term gains in exchange for preserving some resource base.

**Answer:**

At each round, if the current stock is at least 75% of capacity, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect. This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by preventing overexploitation when resources are low.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock} \geq 0.75 \times \text{capacity, else Defect}}

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative-Defector (ACD)

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by balancing cooperation for sustainability and defection to prevent resource depletion.

**Parameters:**
- High Stock Threshold: 70% of capacity
- Moderate Stock Threshold: 30% of capacity
- Recent Rounds Considered: Last 2 rounds

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **High Stock (Stock > 70% capacity):** Cooperate unless more than half of the players in the last two rounds defected.
   - **Moderate Stock (30% < Stock ≤70% capacity):** Cooperate if at least 60% of players cooperated in the last two rounds; otherwise, Defect.
   - **Low Stock (Stock ≤30% capacity):** Tend to Defect. Cooperate only if all or nearly all players cooperated in the last round.

3. **Last Round (Round r):** Always Defect to maximize individual gain without concern for future rounds.

**Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Unilaterally Cooperate.
- **Last Round:** Unilaterally Defect.
- **Very Low Stock (Stock ≤30% capacity):** Default to Defecting more frequently, as cooperation may not prevent collapse.

**Adaptability and Responsiveness:**
- The strategy adapts by monitoring the stock level and recent player behavior. It adjusts between Cooperating and Defecting based on these factors.
- If opponents frequently defect, the strategy shifts towards defection to avoid being exploited.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```python
def decide_action(state, history):
    round_number = state['round']
    stock = state['stock']
    capacity = state['capacity']
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        high_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
        low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
        
        recent_history = history[-2:]  # Last two rounds
        coops_in_recent = sum(1 for h in recent_history if h['action'] == 'C')
        
        if stock > high_threshold:
            if coops_in_recent / (2*n) >= 0.5:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        elif low_threshold < stock <= high_threshold:
            if coops_in_recent / (2*n) >= 0.6:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:  # stock <= low_threshold
            if all(h['action'] == 'C' for h in recent_history):
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy starts with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base.
- It adjusts based on the current stock level and recent player actions, balancing between cooperation for long-term benefits and defection to avoid exploitation or resource collapse.
- By considering the last two rounds, it responds dynamically to changes in opponent behavior while maintaining adaptability to different game states.

description_COLLECTIVE_138 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that dynamically balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and historical player behavior. The strategy aims to sustain the common pool resource while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Players cooperate if the current stock is above an adaptive threshold; otherwise, they defect. The threshold adjusts each round based on historical cooperation rates and changes in stock levels.

2. **Historical Cooperation Factor**: Incorporates the average cooperation rate of all players from previous rounds to influence the threshold adjustment.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**: Cooperate in the first round by default. In the last few rounds, adjust thresholds higher to encourage sustainable consumption.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set an initial threshold `T` as a fraction (e.g., 80%) of the maximum capacity.
   - Define a historical cooperation rate (`H`) starting at 50% since there's no history initially.

2. **Each Round (t = 1 to r)**:
   - **Current Stock Check**: Determine the current stock level `S`.
   - **Adjust Threshold**:
     - Compute `adjusted_T` by adding a penalty based on historical cooperation rate: `adjusted_T = T + (1 - H) * adjustment_factor`. The adjustment factor could be a fraction of capacity, say 0.1 * capacity.
     - Ensure `adjusted_T` stays within reasonable bounds (e.g., between 50% and 100% of capacity).
   - **Decision**:
     - If `S >= adjusted_T`, cooperate; else, defect.
   - **Update Historical Cooperation Rate**: Track the proportion of cooperation actions across all players in this round to update `H` for future rounds.

3. **Stock Dynamics Adjustment**:
   - After each round, observe whether the stock increased or decreased and adjust `T` accordingly (e.g., increase `T` if stock decreases significantly).

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to start sustainably.
   - **Last Few Rounds**: Increase threshold to encourage cooperation and prevent endgame depletion.

### Pseudocode:

```python
Initialize:
    T = 0.8 * capacity  # Initial threshold at 80% of capacity
    H = 0.5             # Initial historical cooperation rate assumption
    adjustment_factor = 0.1 * capacity  # Factor to adjust threshold based on history

For each round in 1..r:
    S = current_stock()
    
    # Calculate adjusted threshold considering historical cooperation
    adjusted_T = T + (1 - H) * adjustment_factor
    # Ensure threshold doesn't go out of bounds
    if adjusted_T > capacity:
        adjusted_T = capacity
    elif adjusted_T < 0.5 * capacity:
        adjusted_T = 0.5 * capacity
    
    # Decision to Cooperate or Defect
    if S >= adjusted_T:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        action = 'D'
    
    # Update historical cooperation rate based on current round's actions
    coop_actions = count of all players' C in this round
    H_new = (H * (t-1) + (coop_actions / n)) / t  # Moving average update
    
    # Adjust T based on stock change for next round
    if S > previous_stock:
        T *= 0.95  # Lower threshold slightly if stock increased
    else:
        T *= 1.05  # Increase threshold if stock decreased
        
    H = H_new  # Update historical rate for next iteration

# Edge Cases Handling
if t == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round by default
elif t >= r - 2:  # Last few rounds, adjust to encourage cooperation
    adjusted_T += 0.2 * capacity  # Higher threshold to prevent depletion
```

### Rationale:

- **Dynamic Threshold**: Adjusts based on both current stock and historical behavior, promoting cooperation when sustainable and encouraging conservation when necessary.
  
- **Incorporating History**: Uses the average cooperation rate to penalize or reward cooperation dynamically, fostering alignment among players without communication.

- **Edge Cases**: Ensures stable initial conditions and prevents endgame overexploitation by adjusting thresholds in final rounds.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive, robust against various opponent behaviors, and aligned with collective sustainability goals.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_139 = '''
The strategy "Adaptive Equilibrium" is designed to balance cooperation and defection in the Common Pool Resource Game, ensuring sustainable resource use while adapting to opponents' behaviors. Here's how it works:

### Strategy: Adaptive Equilibrium

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Starting with cooperation helps maintain a healthy stock level for future rounds, preventing immediate over-consumption.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If the current stock is above 90% of an adjusted capacity, Cooperate.
     - Otherwise, Defect.
   - **Adjusted Capacity Calculation:** 
     - Compute prior consumption as a fraction of total possible consumption across all rounds. This helps gauge how much of the resource has been used up in previous rounds.
   - **Threshold Calculation:**
     - The threshold is set to 90% of the adjusted capacity, ensuring that cooperation occurs only when the stock is sufficiently high to support it without risking depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Since there are no future rounds left, players maximize their immediate payoff by defecting.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, prior_consumption, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate adjusted capacity considering prior consumption
        adjusted_capacity = capacity * (1 - prior_consumption / (total_rounds * n))
        threshold = 0.9 * adjusted_capacity
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Key Considerations

- **Sustainability:** Starting with cooperation in the first round ensures that the resource pool remains healthy, supporting future growth.
- **Adaptability:** By monitoring both current stock levels and past consumption, the strategy adapts to different opponent behaviors without relying on coordination or communication.
- **Threshold Adjustment:** The 90% threshold acts as a buffer, preventing over-depletion while allowing for some flexibility in response to varying conditions.

This approach optimizes collective payoff by balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against a wide range of opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_140 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior and stock dynamics. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Promotes sustainable resource management and sets a positive precedent.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Dynamics:** Track the stock level after each round to assess sustainability.
   - **Adaptive Thresholds:**
     - **Upper Threshold:** If the stock is above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating (C) as it indicates sustainable growth.
     - **Lower Threshold:** If the stock drops below 40% of capacity, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate gains before potential resource depletion.

3. **Adjustment Based on Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Use historical consumption data to identify trends:
     - **High Cooperation:** Continue Cooperating if the stock remains stable or grows.
     - **Significant Defection:** Increase defection frequency to prevent exploitation and protect against rapid resource decline.

4. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on how well cooperation is maintaining the stock. If cooperation isn't effective, shift towards more defection.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round (Round r):** If the stock is high, Cooperate to maintain sustainability; if low, Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Stock Near Capacity:** Cooperate to encourage growth.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Consider defecting if recovery seems unlikely.

This strategy aims to foster cooperation when beneficial while adapting to exploit when necessary, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term resource sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_141 = '''
**Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperative Play**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to establish a baseline of sustainable play.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Use dynamic thresholds relative to the game's capacity:
     - High Threshold: 75% of capacity
     - Medium Threshold: 50% of capacity
     - Low Threshold: 25% of capacity

3. **Decision Rules Based on Current Stock (S):**
   - **If S > High Threshold (0.75 * capacity):**
     - Cooperate to sustain stock and encourage others.
   - **If Medium < S ≤ High:**
     - Evaluate recent history (last few rounds).
     - If less than 30% of actions were Defects, Cooperate; else, Defect.
   - **If Low < S ≤ Medium:**
     - Consider a mixed approach:
       - If recent defects exceed half the players, Defect; otherwise, Cooperate.
   - **If S ≤ Low (0.25 * capacity):**
     - Defect to maximize immediate payoff as stock is near collapse.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to build a sustainable base.
   - **Final Rounds:** Adjust based on remaining stock:
     - High stock: Cooperate to sustain.
     - Low stock: Defect more to capitalize before depletion.

5. **Feedback and Adaptation:**
   - Continuously assess recent history to adjust cooperation levels, balancing immediate gains with future sustainability.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, n, capacity, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        high = 0.75 * capacity
        medium = 0.5 * capacity
        low = 0.25 * capacity
        
        if current_stock > high:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock > medium:
            recent = get_last_few_rounds(history, rounds=3)
            defect_ratio = count_defects(recent) / len(recent)
            return 'C' if defect_ratio < 0.3 else 'D'
        elif current_stock > low:
            recent_defects = count_defects(get_last_few_rounds(history, rounds=5))
            return 'D' if recent_defects > n/2 else 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy prioritizes maintaining cooperation when the stock is healthy to sustain growth.
- It adapts by observing recent behavior; if others defect, it reciprocates to prevent exploitation.
- Dynamic thresholds ensure flexibility across different game parameters, balancing immediate and future payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_142 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize long-term payoffs while adapting to player behavior and game dynamics. Here's a structured summary:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - *Reasoning:* Starts with cooperation to preserve the stock and build a positive history.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-10% of total rounds):**
   - **Conditions for Cooperation:**
     - Stock level is above 75% of capacity.
     - At least 60% of players cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Action if Conditions Met:** Cooperate
     - *Reasoning:* Sustains the resource and encourages collective preservation.
   - **Else:**
     - **Action:** Defect
       - *Reasoning:* Maximizes immediate payoff when cooperation is failing or the stock is threatened.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - *Reasoning:* Focuses on maximizing immediate gains as future rounds are negligible.

4. **Adjustments:**
   - Monitor previous payoffs and stock levels to refine cooperation-defection decisions.
   - If defecting yields higher payoffs without severe depletion, continue defecting.
   - Maintain cooperation if it sustains the resource and prevents collapse.

### Rationale

- **Long-term Sustainability:** Prioritizes cooperation in early rounds to build a healthy stock for future gains.
- **Adaptability:** Adjusts based on player behavior and stock dynamics, encouraging cooperation when viable and defecting when necessary.
- **Responsiveness:** Uses historical data to dynamically adapt, ensuring the strategy remains effective against various opponent strategies.

This approach balances individual gain with collective preservation, adapting to different game phases and player behaviors for robust performance.

To address the challenge of balancing immediate payoffs with future sustainability in a cooperative setting, we propose an adaptive strategy that encourages cooperation under favorable conditions and allows defection when necessary.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to preserve the resource and encourage others to follow suit, setting a foundation for sustainable collaboration.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Observation:** Assess the proportion of players who cooperated in the immediately preceding round.
   - **Current Stock Check:** Evaluate the current stock level as a percentage of capacity.
   - **Decision Making:**
     - If both the cooperation rate is above 70% and the stock is above 80%, continue to cooperate to maintain high resource levels.
     - If either the cooperation rate drops below 70% or the stock falls below 80%, switch to defecting. This action aims to maximize immediate gains while signaling dissatisfaction with low cooperation.

3. **Threshold Adjustments:**
   - The required cooperation threshold decreases when the stock is healthy, promoting leniency.
   - Conversely, a higher cooperation threshold is enforced when the stock is low, encouraging more players to cooperate to prevent collapse.

4. **Final Round Consideration:** In the last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff since future considerations are irrelevant.

### Conclusion:

This strategy balances current gains with future sustainability by adapting to others' actions and the resource's state. It promotes cooperation when beneficial and allows defection when necessary, fostering a resilient approach to resource management.

3. **Endgame Defection**: In the final 25% of total rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate payoffs with minimal concern for future depletions.

### Decision Rules:
- **Round 1**: Cooperate.
- **Rounds 2 to r - (0.25r)**:
   - If current stock > 80% of capacity and increasing compared to two rounds prior: Cooperate.
   - Else: Defect.
- **Last 25% Rounds**: Always Defect.

To address the problem of balancing immediate gains against long-term sustainability in a resource management scenario, we propose a strategic approach that considers current stock levels, others' behavior, and the game's progression. This strategy is encapsulated in the following decision-making framework:

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round (t=1):**
   - Always Cooperate to encourage sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   a. Calculate the average cooperation rate from previous rounds.
      - Determine how many players have been Cooperating on average.
   b. Assess the current stock level:
      - If below 40% of capacity, classify as 'Low' and Cooperate.
      - If above 60%, classify as 'High'; otherwise, it's 'Medium'.
   c. Decide action based on stock level and cooperation rate:
      - For 'Low' stock: Cooperate to rebuild resources.
      - For 'Medium' or 'High' stock: Cooperate if others are mostly Cooperating (above 60%); else, Defect.

3. **Last Few Rounds (t >= r - last_round_buffer):**
   a. If stock is low, Cooperate to prevent further depletion.
   b. If stock is high, Defect to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds do not matter.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- In the first round, always start with Cooperation.
- In the last few rounds, adjust actions based on whether resources are scarce or abundant.
- If the stock collapses to zero, subsequent decisions default to Defecting as there's no recovery possible.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(t, r, n, capacity, current_stock, history):
    if t == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        total_coop = sum(1 for round in history for action in round['actions'] if action == 'C')
        avg_coop = total_coop / (n * (t - 1))
        
        # Determine stock level category
        low_threshold = 0.4 * capacity
        high_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
        
        if current_stock <= low_threshold:
            s_level = 'Low'
        elif current_stock >= high_threshold:
            s_level = 'High'
        else:
            s_level = 'Medium'
        
        # Check proximity to last rounds
        last_round_buffer = max(1, int(r * 0.1))
        if t >= r - last_round_buffer + 1:

                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

            cooperation_threshold = 0.6
            if s_level == 'Low':

                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy effectively balances the need for immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on current conditions and others' behavior. It promotes Cooperation when resources are scarce to rebuild them, allows Defection when resources are abundant and others are Cooperating, and adjusts tactics in the final rounds to maximize payoffs while considering future impacts.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy for balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability involves dynamically adjusting actions based on current stock levels, the cooperation rate of other players, and the game's progression. Here is a concise summary:

- **Start by Cooperating:** In the first round, always Cooperate to encourage sustainable resource management.
- **Assess Stock Levels:** For subsequent rounds, classify the current stock as Low (below 40%), Medium, or High (above 60% of capacity).
  - If Low, Cooperate to rebuild resources.
  - If Medium or High:
    - Cooperate if more than 60% of previous actions were Cooperative.
    - Otherwise, Defect.
- **Adjust in Final Rounds:** In the last 10% of rounds, Cooperate if stock is low; otherwise, Defect.

This strategy ensures that resources are preserved when necessary while allowing for higher immediate payoffs when safe. It adapts to others' behavior and the game's progression, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It adapts based on the current stock level, others' recent actions, and the game's progression.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage a cooperative environment and preserve the resource for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - The current stock is below 75% of capacity, indicating a need to prevent further depletion.
     - A significant number of players have been defecting in recent rounds, suggesting the resource may be at risk.
   - **Defect** if:
     - The current stock is above 75% of capacity, allowing for safe extraction without depleting the resource too much.
     - Many players have been Cooperating recently, indicating it's safe to take more without causing a crash.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = get_capacity()
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        threshold = capacity * 0.75  # Adjust as needed
        recent_coop_count = count_cooperation(history, last_k_rounds=5)
        
        if stock_level < threshold or recent_coop_count <= n / 2:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold (75% of capacity) is a heuristic to balance extraction and sustainability. It can be adjusted based on empirical testing.
- **Recent Cooperation Check:** By monitoring recent cooperation, the strategy adapts to changes in others' behavior, encouraging mutual cooperation when needed.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** The strategy dynamically switches between Cooperate and Defect based on current conditions, promoting long-term resource health while allowing for strategic gains.

This approach ensures that the player maximizes their payoff while contributing to the collective good by maintaining a sustainable resource level.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and stock health. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. Initial Round
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Starting with C signals willingness to share, potentially encouraging others to cooperate and preserve the resource for future rounds.

### 2. Subsequent Rounds
- **Monitor Cooperation Levels:**
  - Track each player's actions over previous rounds.
  - Calculate the percentage of times other players have cooperated.

- **Adaptive Threshold Approach:**
  - If more than a certain threshold (e.g., 60%) of other players cooperate, continue to Cooperate (C).
  - If cooperation drops below this threshold, switch to Defect (D) to prevent being exploited and conserve remaining resources.

### 3. Stock Health Check
- **High Stock Levels:**
  - Continue Cooperating (C) if stock is high and growing sustainably.
  
- **Low or Declining Stock:**
  - Consider defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as the resource may not recover adequately for future rounds.

### 4. Anticipation of Endgame
- **Last Round Handling:**
  - Expect all players to Defect (D), so adjust strategy accordingly in the penultimate round to mitigate losses.
  
- **Final Round Strategy:**
  - Switch to D to maximize immediate payoff, recognizing no future rounds remain.

### 5. Robustness and Adaptability
- **Adaptation to Changing Strategies:**
  - Stay vigilant to shifts in other players' behaviors, adjusting cooperation levels as needed without overreacting to short-term changes.
  
- **Smoothing Factor:**
  - Use a smoothing factor when updating cooperation metrics to maintain stability and avoid abrupt strategy shifts.

### Pseudocode Outline
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history_of_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate cooperation rate of others
        cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(history_of_actions)
        
        # Check stock health
        if stock_level < threshold_stock:
            return 'D'
        elif cooperation_rate > cooperation_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

def handle_last_round():
    return 'D'

def main():
    for round in 1 to r:
        if round == r:
            action = handle_last_round()
        else:
            action = decide_action(round, stock_level, history_of_actions)
        execute(action)

main()
```

### Conclusion
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to others' behaviors and the state of the resource. It encourages cooperation when beneficial but switches to defection to prevent exploitation or resource collapse, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_148 = '''
The strategy involves balancing cooperation with defection based on the current stock level and inferred behavior of other players. Here's a clear breakdown:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage a healthy resource base.

2. **Dynamic Threshold for Action**:
   - Set an initial threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
   - In each round, if the stock is above this threshold, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.
   
3. **Adaptation Based on Past Behavior**:
   - After each round, adjust the threshold based on how much the stock changed. If the stock grew despite significant consumption, it suggests others are Cooperating, so keep or raise the threshold. If the stock dropped, infer more Defectors and lower the threshold.

4. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last few rounds, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains as there's no future benefit in sustainability.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def strategy(round_number, remaining_rounds, current_stock, history):
    capacity = 100  # Example value; adjust based on actual parameters
    initial_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold = initial_threshold

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Adjust threshold based on previous rounds' stock changes
    if history:  # If there is past data
        last_stock_change = current_stock - history[-1]['stock_after']
        if last_stock_change > 0:
            threshold *= 1.05  # Encourage more cooperation if stock grew
        else:
            threshold *= 0.95  # Discourage cooperation if stock dropped
    
    if remaining_rounds <= 3:  # Last few rounds, defect to maximize payoff
        return 'D'
    
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy adapts dynamically, encouraging cooperation when the resource is healthy and switching to defection when necessary, balancing individual gain with collective sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_149 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Sustainability**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a cooperative foundation.
   - **Middle Rounds (2 to r-1)**:
     - Monitor the last m rounds' actions (e.g., 5 rounds) and current stock level.
     - If more than 70% of all player actions were Cooperations and the stock is above 80% of capacity, Cooperate.
     - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate payoff and prevent over-depletion.
   - **Last Round (r)**: Always Defect, as there's no future round for retaliation.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Stock Near Zero**: Automatically Defect, as the resource is nearly depleted.
   - **Initial Cooperation**: Encourage sustainable use by starting with C.

3. **Collective Mindset**:
   - Focus on maintaining a healthy stock level to sustain long-term payoffs.
   - Adaptively switch to defecting when cooperation isn't mutually beneficial or when the resource is at risk of collapse.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation when it benefits everyone and defecting when necessary. It adapts dynamically based on observed behavior and resource health, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Check recent history (last m rounds) for cooperation proportion
        m = 5  # Number of past rounds to consider
        start_index = max(0, len(history) - m)
        recent_history = history[start_index:]
        
        total_players = len(recent_history[0]) if recent_history else 1
        cooperation_count = sum(action == 'C' for round_actions in recent_history for action in round_actions)
        proportion_cooperate = cooperation_count / (total_players * len(recent_history))
        
        # Check stock level against threshold
        safe_threshold = capacity * 0.8
        if proportion_cooperate > 0.7 and current_stock >= safe_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

This strategy ensures that players contribute to maintaining a sustainable resource while protecting their interests in the face of potential exploitation or inevitable depletion in the final round.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_150 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable system where players can either Cooperate or Defect based on the current stock level, we propose the following strategy. This approach balances between sustaining the resource when it's abundant and allowing players to take more when it's scarce, while also considering the risk of collapse if the stock drops too low.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Monitor Current Stock:** At each decision point, assess the current level of the shared resource (stock) relative to its maximum capacity.

2. **Set Thresholds:** Establish a threshold at 75% of the maximum capacity. This serves as the dividing line between Cooperating and Defecting.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - **If Current Stock > 75%:** Players should Cooperate. This ensures that the resource is sustainably managed, allowing for growth and preventing rapid depletion.
   - **If Current Stock ≤ 75%:** Players should Defect. By taking more when the stock is lower, players can secure their share before potential collapse.

4. **Considerations:**
   - **Sustainability When Abundant:** Cooperating when the stock is high maintains a balance and prevents unnecessary depletion.
   - **Mitigating Collapse Risks:** Allowing Defection when the stock drops below 75% can help prevent the resource from being completely exhausted, as players take necessary measures to secure their needs.

**Final Strategy:**

Cooperate if the current stock exceeds 75% of the maximum capacity; otherwise, defect. This strategy balances sustainability with practical resource management, addressing both abundance and scarcity scenarios effectively.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock > 75\%; else, defect}}$

**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while maintaining a sustainable resource pool through adaptive cooperation and defection based on current conditions and historical behavior.

---

### **Strategy Overview**

The strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by adapting to the stock level and other players' actions. It starts with cooperation, transitions based on thresholds and historical data, and defects in later rounds to maximize payoff.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Encourages others to cooperate by setting a positive example.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Check Current Stock (S):**
     - If S ≥ 70% of capacity and more than half of players cooperated in the previous round:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - Preserves the resource, allowing growth for future rounds.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - Maximizes immediate payoff when cooperation is ineffective or stock is low.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Round r-2 to Round r):**
   - As rounds approach the end, prioritize defecting if possible.
     - **Action:** If S > 0, defect to exploit remaining resource without concern for future depletion.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **Stock at Capacity:**
  - Cooperate to maintain high stock and encourage others to do the same.
- **Stock Near Depletion (S approaching 0):**
  - Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as the resource will not recover significantly.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decision_rule(current_stock, capacity, cooperation_history):
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    recent_coop_rate = sum(cooperation_history[-5:]) / len(cooperation_history[-5:]) if len(cooperation_history) >=5 else 1

    # First round: cooperate
    if not cooperation_history:
        return 'C'
    
    # Last few rounds: defect if possible
    if current_round > r - 2:
        return 'D' if current_stock > 0 else 'C'
    
    # Main decision logic
    if current_stock >= threshold and recent_coop_rate > 0.5:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage in each round
for round in rounds:
    action = decision_rule(stock, capacity, cooperation_history)
    record_action(action)
```

---

### **Rationale**

- **Cooperation Threshold (70%):** Balances preservation and growth of the resource with acceptable consumption levels.
- **Recent Cooperation Rate:** Adapts to changing player behaviors. If more than half cooperate, it's safer to join in to avoid exploitation.
- **Endgame Defection:** Maximizes payoff in final rounds without worrying about future depletions.

This strategy is robust, adaptive, and aligns with collective sustainability goals while protecting against exploitation.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

Our strategy balances cooperation with defecting based on stock levels and game progression. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same, setting a positive precedent.

2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Cooperate as long as:
   - The current stock is above 75% of capacity.
   - There are more than three rounds remaining.

3. **Defecting Conditions**:
   - Switch to defecting when in the last three rounds, maximizing immediate payoff with no future considerations.
   - If the stock drops below 25% of capacity, defect to exploit remaining resources before potential depletion.

4. **Adaptive Adjustments**: Lower the cooperation threshold if observing a higher rate of defecting by others, ensuring it doesn't fall below 50% of capacity to prevent rapid resource collapse.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage mutual cooperation.
- **Last Three Rounds**: Defect to maximize immediate gains without regard for future rounds.

This strategy adapts dynamically, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary or advantageous, balancing between long-term sustainability and short-term gains.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Cooperative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to encourage cooperation while adapting to opponents' behavior, ensuring sustainable stock levels for maximum total payoff. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial Play (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reasoning: Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent and helps maintain a stable stock level early on.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Decision Rule:** Cooperate if:
     - The current stock is above a threshold (e.g., half the capacity).
     - In the previous rounds, most players were Cooperating.
   - **Defect Condition:** Defect (D) if:
     - The current stock is below the threshold.
     - A significant proportion of players have been defecting in recent rounds.

3. **Later Rounds:**
   - **Action Adjustment:** Maintain cooperation to preserve the stock unless a large number of players are defecting, which may justify defecting temporarily.
     - Reasoning: Avoiding a crash ensures long-term sustainability and higher total payoff.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C).
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Continue Cooperating to maintain stock stability, even though defecting might yield higher immediate gains. This prevents a sudden crash in the final rounds.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```plaintext
function decide_action(round_number, current_stock, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return C

            return C
        else:
            return D
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy starts with cooperation to encourage a sustainable stock.
- It adapts by observing others' actions, continuing to cooperate if the majority does so and the stock is healthy.
- If many defect or the stock is low, it switches to defection temporarily.
- This balance aims to maximize total payoff while preventing stock crashes.

The designed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is an adaptive, collective approach aimed at balancing immediate payoffs with long-term resource sustainability. Here's a structured overview of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Decision Rule Based on Stock Level:**
   - Cooperate if the current stock is below a dynamically adjusted threshold.
   - Defect otherwise.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Start with an initial threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity).
   - Adjust the threshold based on past growth rates and consumption trends:
     - Increase the threshold if stock consistently remains above target, indicating robustness.
     - Decrease it if stock falls below target, signaling the need for conservation.

3. **Early Rounds Emphasize Cooperation:**
   - In the first few rounds, lean towards cooperation to build a resource buffer, ensuring sustainable growth in subsequent rounds.

4. **Adaptation Near Game End:**
   - As rounds approach the end (last 10%), shift strategy towards defection since future considerations are less critical.

5. **Monitoring and Adjustment:**
   - Track past actions and cooperation levels to adjust strategies dynamically.
   - Use a weighted average of current stock and recent trends to inform decisions, ensuring adaptability without excessive complexity.

### Summary

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation thresholds based on observed resource conditions and past performance. It encourages collective behavior through simple rules that can be independently applied by each player, fostering a sustainable use of the common pool resource without relying on explicit coordination or assumptions about others' strategies beyond observable actions.

The strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to the game's dynamics and other players' behaviors. Here is a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** If the stock level is above a critical threshold (e.g., half of capacity) and a majority of players cooperated in recent rounds.
   - **Defect (D):** If the stock is below the critical threshold or if cooperation rates have been low, indicating potential exploitation.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Default to Cooperate to encourage a stable start.
   - **Last Round:** Consider defecting, but maintain cooperation if it promotes higher overall payoffs and resource sustainability.

3. **Adaptive Mechanism:**
   - Use historical data on cooperation rates to adjust thresholds dynamically. If past rounds show high defection, be more cautious in future decisions.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to set a positive precedent and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Assess Stock Level:** Check if the current stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., half of capacity).
     - If yes, proceed to check cooperation history.
     - If no, defect to conserve resources.
   - **Evaluate Cooperation History:** Look at the proportion of cooperators in recent rounds.
     - If the majority cooperated, continue cooperating.
     - If cooperation was low, defect to prevent being exploited.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Adjust the critical threshold and required cooperation rate based on historical performance and stock dynamics observed in previous rounds.

4. **Last Round Consideration:**
   - While tempted to defect, consider the potential for higher payoffs through continued cooperation and its impact on long-term sustainability.

### Rationale:
- Cooperating when others do so maintains a stable stock level, ensuring sustainable growth and higher payoffs over time.
- Defecting when necessary prevents resource depletion, protecting against exploitation by defectors and conserving resources for future rounds.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while promoting collective sustainability, adapting dynamically to game conditions and other players' behaviors.

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while maintaining the common pool's sustainability through adaptive behavior based on current stock levels and recent cooperation rates.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Initial move to encourage sustainability and observe others' behavior.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   a. Calculate the current stock level, S.
   b. Determine the proportion of Cooperators in the past k rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds).
   c. If:
      - S ≥ S_thr (e.g., capacity * 0.6)
      - AND cooperation rate > y% (e.g., 70%)
     - **Action:** Cooperate
   d. Else:
      - **Action:** Defect

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Maximize immediate payoff as there's no future impact.

---

### **Parameters**

- **S_thr:** Threshold stock level, e.g., 60% of capacity.
- **k:** Number of recent rounds to consider for cooperation rate (e.g., 3).
- **y%:** Minimum cooperation rate required to Cooperate (e.g., 70%).

---

### **Rationale**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Promotes sustainability and provides a basis for mutual cooperation among players.
- **Adaptive Behavior:** Switches between Cooperating and Defecting based on the resource's health and others' actions, preventing over-depletion while exploiting when necessary.
- **Final Round Defection:** Ensures maximum payoff in the last round without worrying about future consequences.

---

### **Example Scenario**

- **Round 1:** All players Cooperate. Stock remains at capacity.
- **Round 2:** Some defect. If stock is above S_thr (60%), and cooperation rate is high (70%), continue Cooperating.
- **Round 3:** More defecting. Cooperation rate drops below threshold. Switch to Defect.
- **Round 4:** Stock dips below S_thr. Continue Defecting.
- **Round 5 (Last):** Defect regardless of stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If the current stock is above a threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity), continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoffs.

3. **Final Few Rounds (Last 2-5 rounds):**
   - **Adjustment:** Gradually shift towards more Defecting as the game nears its end to prioritize current gains over future payoffs.

4. **Edge Cases and Considerations:**
   - **Rapid Depletion:** If many players defect early, switch to D preemptively to salvage payoffs.
   - **Perfect Information:** Use historical data to anticipate trends and adjust strategies accordingly.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_158 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock Levels**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Early Rounds:** Cooperate if the stock is above 75% of capacity. This promotes sustainability and keeps the resource replenishing.
   - **Mid Game:** If the stock drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 25%), switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs as others may be exploiting the common pool.
   - **Late Rounds:** Always Defect in the last few rounds to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future replenishment.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate since the stock is at capacity, ensuring a sustainable start.
   - **Low Stock Situations:** If the stock drops below 25%, immediately switch to Defecting to prevent being left with nothing as others exploit the resource.
   - **Endgame (Last Few Rounds):** Always Defect to maximize payoffs, as future rounds are minimal or non-existent.

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   The strategy aligns with a collective approach by initially promoting cooperation for sustainability. However, it adaptively switches to defecting when necessary, ensuring individual payoff maximization without relying on others' cooperation, thus balancing between collective benefit and self-interest.

**Pseudocode:**

```

- early_rounds = first 1/3 of total rounds
- late_rounds_start = last 2/5 of total rounds
- high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
- low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity

description_COLLECTIVE_159 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource while maximizing individual gains over multiple rounds, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on observed behavior and current stock levels. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players choose to Cooperate (C). This action starts sustainably, maintaining the resource at its maximum capacity for future rounds.

2. **Adaptive Play in Subsequent Rounds:**
   - For each subsequent round, each player evaluates two factors:
     a) The proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round.
     b) The current stock level relative to a predefined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).

3. **Decision Rules Based on Previous Cooperation:**
   - If more than half of the players Cooperated in the previous round, continue Cooperating this round. This reinforces sustainable behavior and maintains trust among participants.
   - If less than or equal to half of the players Cooperated, consider defecting (D). However, this decision is also influenced by the current stock level.

4. **Stock Level Threshold Check:**
   - Even if cooperation was low in the previous round, continue Cooperating if the current stock level remains above a certain threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity). This helps prevent over-depletion and ensures that the resource can recover.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, players switch to Defecting. This action is taken as a protective measure against potential collapse and reflects a strategic response to sustain individual gains.

5. **Behavior in Final Rounds:**
   - In the last round (round r), all players choose to Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds left, maximizing immediate gain becomes the priority.
   - In the second-to-last round (round r-1), players anticipate that others will defect in the final round. Therefore, they may also choose to Defect in round r-1 to maximize their gains before the resource is depleted.

6. **Edge Cases and Considerations:**
   - If cooperation rates are consistently high and the stock remains stable above the threshold, continued cooperation sustains the resource.
   - If cooperation rates drop significantly despite a healthy stock level, players might switch to defecting, potentially leading to a collapse of the resource in subsequent rounds.

By following this strategy, players balance between sustaining the resource through cooperation when feasible and defecting strategically to prevent over-depletion or capitalize on others' actions. This approach aims to maximize individual gains while promoting collective sustainability for as long as possible.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a balanced strategy that prioritizes long-term sustainability while adapting to other players' actions. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Sustainability Checks

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first few rounds to build up the stock and promote sustainability.

2. **Sustainability Monitoring**: Continuously track a sustainability metric, such as the change in stock levels over successive rounds. This metric helps determine if cooperation is effective or if defectors are causing over-depletion.

3. **Defection Thresholds**: If the sustainability metric falls below a predetermined threshold (indicating unsustainability), switch to defecting for a limited period. This action signals the need for adjustment and reduces personal losses from others' defection.

4. **Reassessment and Adaptation**: After switching to defection, reassess the sustainability metric. If it improves, return to cooperation. If not, consider further adaptation or continued defection.

5. **Final Rounds Adjustment**: In the last few rounds, defect more frequently since future payoffs are irrelevant, maximizing short-term gains without affecting long-term sustainability.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_history, opponent_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate sustainability metric
    sustainability = calculate_sustainability(stock_history)
    
    if sustainability > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Check if previous rounds were defective
        recent_defections = count_defections(opponent_actions, last_n_rounds=5)
        if recent_defections > defect_threshold:
            return 'D'  # Defect to signal and adjust
        else:
            return 'C'  # Continue cooperation
    
    # In final rounds, prioritize personal gain
    if round_number >= r - final_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
def calculate_sustainability(stock_history):
    # Example: Calculate change in stock over time
    recent_stock = stock_history[-window_size:]
    avg_change = (recent_stock[-1] - recent_stock[0]) / window_size
    return avg_change

# Threshold and parameters can be tuned based on initial tests
threshold = 0.8 * capacity  # Example threshold
defect_threshold = 3        # Number of defects to trigger switch
final_rounds = 3            # Rounds near the end where defection is prioritized
window_size = 5             # Number of rounds considered for sustainability metric
```

### Conclusion

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource health, adapting dynamically to other players' behaviors. By using clear thresholds and reassessment mechanisms, it encourages cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection when necessary, fostering a collective approach to sustain the common pool effectively.

description_COLLECTIVE_161 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation and defection in a shared-resource setting, we propose a strategy that adapts based on the observed health of the resource (stock). The goal is to sustain cooperation while protecting against over-exploitation.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Observation Phase:** Each player observes the current stock level relative to the maximum capacity.
2. **Threshold Check:** If the stock is above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating (C). This promotes sustainable use and maintains resource levels.
3. **Defection Trigger:** If the stock drops below 80%, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate gain while minimizing further depletion caused by others' actions.
4. **Dynamic Adaptation:** By focusing on the current stock, the strategy adapts to changes without requiring communication or knowledge of others' strategies.

**Answer:**

Each player employs a threshold-based strategy:

- Cooperate if the current stock is above 80% of capacity.
- Defect otherwise.

This approach ensures sustainable resource use while allowing players to respond to signs of over-exploitation by others.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock > 80\% of capacity; else, defect.}}

description_COLLECTIVE_162 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a resource management game, we propose a cooperative-defection strategy that adapts based on current stock levels and historical cooperation rates. The strategy is designed to encourage cooperation when it benefits all players and switch to defection when necessary to prevent over-depletion.

### Approach
The strategy involves the following key components:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Players start by cooperating in the initial rounds to build up the resource stock, encouraging others to do the same.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: In subsequent rounds, players decide whether to cooperate or defect based on a dynamically adjusted threshold of the current stock relative to capacity and the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
3. **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment**: The threshold decreases over time as fewer rounds remain, reflecting the reduced incentive to preserve resources for an uncertain future.
4. **Majority Influence**: Players consider the cooperation rate of others from the previous round, using it as a factor in their current decision to cooperate or defect.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(S_current, capacity, remaining_rounds, total_rounds, prev_coop_rate):
    """
    Determines whether to Cooperate or Defect based on current stock (S_current),
    capacity, remaining rounds, total rounds, and the previous round's cooperation rate.
    
    Parameters:
        S_current: float - Current stock level
        capacity: float - Maximum possible stock level
        remaining_rounds: int - Number of rounds left including the current one
        total_rounds: int - Total number of rounds in the game
        prev_coop_rate: float - Proportion of players who Cooperated last round
        
    Returns:
        'Cooperate' or 'Defect'
    """
    # Calculate the threshold based on remaining rounds
    threshold = max(0.5, 0.75 * (remaining_rounds / total_rounds))
    
    # Determine cooperation decision
    if S_current > capacity * threshold and prev_coop_rate > 0.6:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with players cooperating to build a healthy resource stock, fostering an environment where mutual cooperation is beneficial.
2. **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold for deciding whether to cooperate decreases as the game progresses, encouraging more defection towards the end when future rounds are less valuable. This adjustment ensures that players balance immediate gains against long-term sustainability effectively.
3. **Stock Check**: Players check if the current stock level exceeds the dynamically adjusted threshold. A higher threshold in early rounds promotes cooperation to maintain resource health, while a lower threshold near the end allows for more defection as future benefits diminish.
4. **Cooperation Rate Influence**: By considering the previous round's cooperation rate, players are incentivized to cooperate when others are also cooperating, reinforcing collective action and maintaining higher stock levels.

This approach ensures that players adapt their strategies dynamically, responding to both current resource conditions and historical behavior patterns to achieve a balance between immediate gains and sustainable resource management.

description_COLLECTIVE_163 = '''
To design a robust and adaptive strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability by monitoring the stock level. The strategy is as follows:

### Strategy Overview:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage sustainable resource use.
- **Threshold-Based Adaptation:** Adjust actions based on the stock level relative to a threshold (80% of capacity).
- **Dynamic Response:** Continue Cooperating if the stock remains above the threshold; switch to Defecting if it drops below, signaling overuse.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Initiate with cooperation to support resource sustainability and observe other players' actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Assess Stock Level:**
     - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
       - **Rationale:** Maintain sustainable consumption, allowing the resource to regenerate.
     - If the current stock is at or below 80% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
       - **Rationale:** Respond to overuse by maximizing immediate gains while signaling the need for adjustment.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level each round.
   - Use past trends to dynamically adjust thresholds if necessary, preventing oscillations and ensuring adaptability to varying player behaviors.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Default to Cooperate as no prior information is available.
- **Last Rounds (if known):** Consider defecting more to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds. However, in the given problem with finite rounds but unknown end, treat all rounds similarly unless dynamically adjusted.

### Example Scenarios:
- **All Cooperate:** Stock remains stable, strategy continues to Cooperate.
- **Some Defect:** If stock drops below threshold, switch to Defecting, potentially leading others to adjust, fostering recovery if cooperation resumes.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by reacting adaptively to the observed state of the resource, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_164 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining sustainable cooperation among players in an iterated game where defection leads to resource depletion, we propose a collective strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term stability.

**Strategy Overview:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by cooperating to establish a stable resource base and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Monitor Cooperation Levels:** Track the proportion of players who cooperate in each round. If cooperation is prevalent, continue to cooperate; if not, switch to defecting to signal disapproval or protect against exploitation.
3. **Adapt Based on Resource Health:** Use the current stock level as an indicator of sustainable behavior. When resources are healthy (above a threshold), be more forgiving and maintain cooperation. If resources drop significantly, lower the threshold for switching to defection to prevent further depletion.
4. **Late Game Adjustment:** As the end of the game approaches, slightly increase the tendency to defect to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited.

**Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a positive precedent and build a stable resource foundation.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
  - If this proportion exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%), continue cooperating.
  - If it falls below the threshold, switch to defecting to either encourage others to cooperate or protect against further resource depletion.
- **Stock Level Adjustment:** Before deciding based on cooperation rates, check if the current stock is significantly lower than capacity. If so, adjust thresholds to make it easier to defect in response to over-consumption.
- **Late Game Strategy:** In the last 10% of rounds, increase the tendency to defect slightly to capitalize on immediate gains as future rounds are limited.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Default to Cooperate to foster a cooperative environment from the start.
- **Last Rounds Adjustment:** Acknowledge that in the final stages, maximizing current payoffs is more critical since there's no future benefit to lose.
- **Stock Depletion:** If resources drop critically low, even if others cooperate, consider defecting more aggressively to prevent further losses and incentivize others to revert to cooperation.

**Collective Mindset:**

The strategy aims to encourage collective cooperation by rewarding it with sustainable resource levels and punishing defection through strategic responses. By mirroring the majority action when possible and adapting based on stock health, it seeks to maintain a balance that prevents over-depletion while allowing for mutual gains.

This approach ensures that players contribute to long-term sustainability while remaining vigilant against exploitation, fostering an environment where cooperation thrives unless challenged by significant defection.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{C}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_165 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation in a repeated game with potential defection, we propose a strategy that combines initial trust-building, monitoring of others' actions, and adaptive responses to maintain sustainability.

**Strategy Outline:**

1. **Initial Cooperation (Trust-Building Phase):**
   - Cooperate for the first two rounds to establish a cooperative environment and observe others' behavior without immediate pressure.

2. **Monitoring Phase:**
   - After each round, record the number of players who Defected (chose D) in that round.
   - Calculate the defection rate as the proportion of Defectors relative to the total number of players.

3. **Adaptive Response Based on Defection Trends:**
   - If, over the last three consecutive rounds, more than half of the players (including yourself) have Defected each time:
     a. Switch to a Tit-for-Tat approach for the next two rounds.
     b. In this phase, mirror the previous round's actions of the majority or punish those who Defected by also defecting in the following round.

4. **Defensive Phase:**
   - If the stock level drops below 80% of capacity, prioritize maintaining Cooperation to allow for regrowth:
     a. Cooperate if the defection rate is low (below 20%), encouraging others to do the same.
     b. If the defection rate remains high despite low stock levels, continue using Tit-for-Tat to signal disapproval and encourage a return to Cooperation.

5. **Hysteresis Effect:**
   - To prevent rapid oscillations between strategies, require a significant improvement in cooperation before switching back:
     - Only revert to full Cooperation if the defection rate drops below 10% for two consecutive rounds after exiting Tit-for-Tat mode.

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Establishes a baseline of trust and allows players to observe each other's behavior without immediate pressure.
- **Monitoring Phase:** Enables detection of trends in defection rates, crucial for timely adaptation.
- **Tit-for-Tat Approach:** Encourages mutual cooperation by rewarding Cooperators and punishing Defectors, helping to stabilize behavior.
- **Defensive Phase:** Prioritizes stock health to prevent crashes, balancing between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.
- **Hysteresis Effect:** Prevents instability caused by rapid strategy switches due to minor fluctuations in defection rates.

This strategy aims to maintain a stable equilibrium where Cooperation is sustained through mutual rewards and controlled responses to Defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_166 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances immediate payoffs with future sustainability. This strategy dynamically adjusts based on the current stock level and historical trends, encouraging cooperation while penalizing excessive defection through resource depletion.

### Strategy Description:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start by cooperating to promote a healthy initial stock.
   - Set an initial threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) to gauge when to shift strategies based on the stock's state.

2. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate:** If the average recent stock level is above the threshold, continue cooperating to maintain or increase resource levels.
   - **Defect:** If the stock falls below the threshold, switch to defecting to signal the need for others to cooperate and prevent further depletion.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Increase the threshold slightly if cooperation leads to sustained growth, encouraging more future cooperation.
   - Decrease the threshold if defection causes resource decline, signaling a shift towards more defection until cooperation is restored.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a positive tone and encourage others to do the same.
   - **Final Rounds (Last 5%):** Gradually increase defection likelihood as future punishment for bad behavior diminishes, focusing on maximizing immediate payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(historical_stock, current_round, total_rounds):
    capacity = get_capacity()
    threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    recent_history_length = min(5, len(historical_stock))
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    if current_round > total_rounds - (total_rounds * 0.05):
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate average stock over the last few rounds
    recent_stocks = historical_stock[-recent_history_length:]
    avg_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
    
    if avg_stock > threshold:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        action = 'D'
    
    # Adjust threshold based on growth
    last_stock = historical_stock[-1]
    current_after = get_current_stock_after()
    total_consumption = sum(get_actions())
    stock_after_consumption = last_stock - total_consumption
    growth = current_after - stock_after_consumption
    
    if action == 'C' and growth > 0:
        threshold *= 1.01
    elif action == 'D' and growth <= 0:
        threshold *= 0.99
    
    return action
```

### Explanation:

- **Cooperation Signal:** By starting with cooperation, the strategy promotes resource sustainability and sets a positive precedent for other players.
- **Dynamic Thresholding:** Adjusting thresholds based on recent stock trends ensures adaptability to changing conditions, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Special considerations for initial and final rounds ensure optimal short-term gains while preserving long-term sustainability.

This strategy aims to create a balance where cooperation is rewarded with sustainable payoffs, while defection leads to resource depletion, incentivizing all players towards collective resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_167 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for all players, we analyze the game dynamics:

1. **Cooperation Stability**: If all players cooperate (C), each receives 12.5 per round, and resources remain stable at 100.

2. **Defection Temptation**: Defecting (D) in a single round gives 25 instead of 12.5, but it reduces future resources, leading to lower payoffs for everyone, including the defector.

3. **Nash Equilibrium Consideration**: Always Cooperating isn't a Nash equilibrium because defecting offers higher immediate payoff when others Cooperate.

4. **Repeated Game Strategy**: In repeated games, players can use strategies that punish defection (e.g., defecting forever after any defection), which deters initial defections by making future payoffs worse for all.

5. **Collective Benefit of Cooperation**: Despite the temptation to defect, sustained cooperation maximizes long-term payoffs as it preserves resource levels, ensuring consistent higher returns each round.

**Answer:** All players should choose C (Cooperate) every round to sustain maximum long-term benefits.

$\boxed{C}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_168 = '''
**Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C) to promote a healthy stock and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Stock Level Check:**
     - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock is between 20% and 80%, assess the proportion of defectors in recent rounds:
       - If fewer than 30% of players Defected in previous rounds, Cooperate.
       - If 30% or more Defected, switch to Defecting (D).
     - If the stock drops below 20%, start defecting to maximize immediate gains before potential depletion.

3. **Final Rounds:**
   - As we approach the last few rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds), increase the tendency to Defect, especially if the stock is low, as there's no future punishment for over-consumption.

4. **Edge Cases and Considerations:**
   - Use dynamic thresholds based on observed behavior and game parameters.
   - Smooth transitions between Cooperate and Defect actions by averaging defection rates over multiple rounds to prevent oscillations.
   - Be cautious in games with higher numbers of players, as each defection's impact varies but collectively can deplete the stock significantly.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to current stock levels and recent player behavior. It avoids relying on others' specific strategies beyond observable actions, ensuring robustness across different game conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_169 = '''
**Final Answer:**

To design a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that maximizes total payoff while encouraging sustainability, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players Cooperate (C) to maintain the stock at its capacity level, ensuring sustainable growth and consistent payoffs.

2. **Cooperation Tracking**: Monitor the number of players who Cooperated in each previous round. If more than half of the players consistently Cooperate (e.g., over 50% in the last three rounds), continue Cooperating to sustain the stock.

3. **Defection Punishment**: If a player Defected (D) in the immediately preceding round, respond by defecting in the current round to punish them. After punishment, revert to Cooperate if they start Cooperating again.

4. **Stock Sustainability Check**: Each round, check if the stock is below 30% of capacity. If it is, all players should Defect temporarily for one round to allow the stock to recover. Return to Cooperate in subsequent rounds once the stock recovers above this threshold.

5. **Final Rounds Handling**: In the last few rounds (approximately the final 5% of total rounds), if the majority have been Cooperating throughout the game, all players should continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability and avoid a rush to defect for higher payoffs.

**Implementation Steps:**

- Track cooperation history for each player.
- Assess stock health each round using the threshold.
- Apply conditional actions based on previous rounds' outcomes and current stock level.

This strategy balances individual incentives with collective sustainability by using clear, adaptive rules that respond to players' behavior and the state of the common pool.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_170 = '''
To address the problem of designing a strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a threshold-based adaptive strategy that balances immediate and future payoffs while considering the behavior of other players. The strategy is designed to be robust, responsive to stock levels, and aligned with collective sustainability.

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Rounds**: Start by Cooperating when the stock is at or near capacity. This promotes sustainable resource management and allows for growth.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - **High Threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity)**: Cooperate to maintain a healthy stock level and encourage mutual sustainability.
   - **Middle Range (e.g., between 70% and 90%)**: Implement a mixed strategy where cooperation is the default, but consider defecting if there's significant defection by others in previous rounds. This helps prevent over-depletion while signaling the need for caution.
   - **Low Threshold (e.g., below 70%)**: Switch to Defecting to salvage remaining resources and avoid further depletion.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - After each round, adjust thresholds based on the number of players who Defected and the impact on stock levels. If defection is prevalent and causing rapid depletion, lower the high threshold or adjust behavior accordingly.
   - Use historical data to predict future trends and adapt thresholds dynamically.

4. **Final Rounds**: In later rounds, prioritize immediate payoff by defecting if the stock is low. However, maintain cooperation if possible to sustain higher payoffs and prevent complete resource depletion.

5. **Memory Component**: Remember how many players have Defected in recent rounds and adjust behavior to respond to potential cascades of defection without causing instability.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, history, current_round):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()

    # Initialize thresholds
    high_threshold = 0.9 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.7 * capacity

    # Adjust thresholds based on historical behavior and stock dynamics
    if stock > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif low_threshold <= stock <= high_threshold:
        # Mixed strategy: Cooperate most times but occasionally Defect
        num_defectors_last_round = sum(history[-1]['actions'] == 'D')
        if num_defectors_last_round / n >= 0.5:
            return 'D'  # Defect if more than half defected last round
        else:
            return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

    # Additional considerations for final rounds
    if current_round > r - 5:  # Last few rounds
        if stock < low_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Thresholds**: The strategy uses dynamic thresholds to decide between Cooperating and Defecting. High cooperation at high stock levels encourages sustainability, while defecting at lower levels prevents resource depletion.
- **Mixed Strategy in Middle Range**: By occasionally defecting when others do, the strategy signals the need for caution without causing instability.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: The strategy adapts thresholds based on historical data and current trends to respond effectively to changing conditions.
- **Final Rounds Consideration**: Ensures that even towards the end of the game, cooperation is maintained if beneficial, preventing complete resource collapse.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adaptively responding to other players' behaviors while promoting collective cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_171 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a stable stock level while maximizing individual payoffs without communication, we propose a strategy that incorporates feedback from recent rounds and employs thresholds to balance between cooperation and defection. The strategy is designed to prevent crashes by encouraging cooperation when necessary and defecting cautiously.

**Strategy:**

1. **First Round:** Cooperate to start gently.
2. **Last Round:** Defect to maximize individual payoff since there's no future round for retaliation.
3. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - The current stock level \( S \) is below 50% of the capacity.
     - In the last round, more than half of the players defected (to encourage rebuilding).
   - **Defect** otherwise.

This strategy aims to prevent crashes by promoting cooperation when the stock is low or after a round with many defections. It also allows defecting when the stock is sufficiently high and recent rounds have shown sustained cooperation.

**Example Walkthrough:**

- **Round 1:** All players Cooperate.
  - Stock \( S = 100 \).
  - Each C consumes \( 12.5 \), total T = 50.
  - Stock after consumption: 50.
  - Growth: 50, new stock \( S' = 100 \).

- **Round 2:** Since \( S = 100 > 50\% \) and last round had no defections, all Defect.
  - T = 100, Stock after consumption: 0.
  - Growth: 0, new stock \( S' = 0 \).

- **Round 3:** Since \( S = 0 < 50\% \), all Cooperate.
  - No change; stock remains 0.

This example highlights a potential flaw where the strategy leads to a crash. To mitigate this, further adjustments might be needed, such as avoiding defection when the stock is near capacity or incorporating more sophisticated feedback mechanisms.

**Final Answer:**

The strategy balances cooperation and defection based on current stock levels and recent player behavior to prevent crashes while maximizing individual payoffs. It is defined as:

- Cooperate in the first round.
- Defect in the last round.
- Cooperate if the current stock is below 50% or more than half defected last round; otherwise, defect.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock < 50% or previous round had majority defection; else defect}}

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by cooperating in the first few rounds to help maintain or grow the stock, fostering a cooperative environment.

2. **Adaptive Defection:**
   - Monitor the current stock level and the proportion of cooperators from previous rounds.
   - If the stock is above 75% of capacity and more than half of other players are defecting, switch to defecting for higher immediate payoffs.

3. **Cooperation on Decline:** If the stock falls below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity) or shows signs of depletion, revert to cooperation to prevent further collapse and allow the resource to recover.

4. **Endgame Defection:** In the last two rounds, defect fully as there are no future rounds to consider, maximizing immediate payoffs.

### Decision Rules:
- **Cooperate** in the first round.
- For each subsequent round:
  - If stock > 75% capacity and >50% of other players defected last round: **Defect.**
  - Else: **Cooperate.**
- In the last two rounds: **Always Defect.**

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **High Stock (Above 75%):** Safe to defect if others are doing so, leveraging high resource availability.
- **Low Stock (Below 25%):** Critical to cooperate to prevent collapse and allow recovery.
- **Trend Analysis:** If stock is decreasing despite cooperation, consider adjusting thresholds to encourage more cooperation.

### Implementation:
The strategy dynamically adjusts based on current conditions, ensuring adaptability without relying on coordination with other players. It balances immediate gains against long-term resource sustainability, aiming for an optimal payoff over the game's duration.

The proposed strategy is designed to maximize collective and individual payoffs by balancing cooperation and defection based on the current state of the stock and historical cooperation rates. Here's a structured overview:

### Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT)

#### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate over the past `k` rounds (e.g., 5 rounds).
   - If the current stock is above a target level (e.g., 75% of capacity) and the recent cooperation rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%), Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect.

#### Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to build trust.
- **Last Round**: Cooperate to maintain sustainability; if others defect, it prevents rapid depletion.
- **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), consider Defecting more frequently unless others are Cooperating significantly.

#### Dynamic Adjustments:
- After each round, update the target stock level based on observed growth. If the stock increases despite cooperation, lower the threshold for defection.
- If cooperation leads to decreasing stock, it indicates high defect rates; adjust thresholds accordingly.

### Pseudocode Outline:

                avg_coop = 1.0  # Assume all Cooperate if no history

            # Check current stock and cooperation rate
            if S[t] > target_stock and avg_coop >= threshold_coop_rate:
                action_i[t] = Cooperate
            else:
                action_i[t] = Defect

        # Record action for future reference
        coop_history.append(1 if action_i[t] == Cooperate else 0)

    After all rounds, update target_stock based on observed trends.

```

### Explanation:

- **Adaptive Cooperation**: The strategy adapts by observing the cooperation rate and adjusting actions to either sustain the resource or maximize individual gain when others defect.
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Dynamically adjusts thresholds based on the stock's health, ensuring sustainability while preventing over-exploitation.
- **Edge Case Management**: Handles first and last rounds with specific rules to encourage trust and prevent depletion.

This strategy aims to foster a balance between collective resource management and individual payoff maximization.

description_COLLECTIVE_174 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock Sustainability**

1. **Initial Cooperate Phase:**
   - In the first round, default to cooperation (C). This helps maintain a higher stock level, promoting sustainable growth.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Calculate a dynamic threshold based on the initial capacity and observed trends in stock levels.
   - If the current stock is above this threshold, continue cooperating to sustain resource growth.
   - Below the threshold, switch to defecting (D) to secure immediate payoffs and prevent further depletion.

3. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Track stock levels over rounds. Use historical data to assess whether cooperation is leading to sustainable outcomes or if defection is becoming prevalent among opponents.

4. **Sustainability Check:**
   - After each round, evaluate if the current stock level indicates that cooperation is still beneficial. This involves calculating potential future gains from sustained cooperation versus immediate gains from defecting.

5. **Defect Response to Low Stock:**
   - If the stock drops significantly (below a predetermined percentage of initial capacity), defect to prevent further resource collapse and maximize short-term payoff.

6. **No Fixed Rounds Consideration:**
   - Since rounds are not fixed, focus on the state of the stock rather than round numbers. Adjust strategies dynamically based on current and past stock levels.

7. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to promote a healthy initial resource base.
   - **Significantly Low Stock:** Defect to prevent further depletion and secure immediate gains.
   - **Near Capacity Stock:** Cooperate to encourage sustainable growth for future rounds.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
for each player:
    threshold = capacity * 0.8  # Adjust based on game dynamics

    if current_round == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        stock_history = get_stock_levels()
        sustainability_trend = calculate_trend(stock_history)
        
        if current_stock > threshold and sustainability_trend is positive:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'

    return action
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to the game's state and opponent behaviors without requiring communication. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection when necessary to prevent resource collapse.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_175 = '''
To address the problem of determining whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round, we can employ a heuristic-based strategy that considers both the historical cooperation rates of other players and the current state of the shared resource (stock). The strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - In the first round, choose to Cooperate (C) to encourage a cooperative environment.

2. **Monitor Previous Rounds:**
   - For each subsequent round, review the actions of other players in the last few rounds (e.g., the previous 5 rounds).
   - Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated during this period.

3. **Assess Stock Health:**
   - Track the current stock level relative to its capacity.
   - Define thresholds:
     - **High Stock Threshold:** e.g., 80% of capacity.
     - **Low Stock Threshold:** e.g., 60% of capacity.

4. **Determine Action Based on Conditions:**
   - If the stock is above the High Stock Threshold and a significant majority (e.g., more than 70%) of players Cooperated in recent rounds, continue to Cooperate.
   - If the stock is below the Low Stock Threshold or if there has been a consistent pattern of Defectors causing the stock to decline, switch to Defecting to secure higher immediate payoffs and prevent further resource depletion.
   - Consider adjusting actions dynamically based on whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable.

5. **Endgame Adjustment:**
   - As the total number of rounds progresses towards its conclusion (e.g., in the last 10% of rounds), increase the tendency to Defect to capitalize on remaining resources before they are depleted.

**Answer:**

To determine whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round, follow this strategy:

- **Early Rounds:** Start by Cooperating to foster a cooperative environment.
- **Middle Rounds:** Continue Cooperating if most players have been Cooperating and the stock remains healthy. Switch to Defecting if there are many Defectors causing stock depletion.
- **Endgame:** Near the end of the rounds, increase the tendency to Defect to maximize immediate gains.

This approach balances cooperation with self-interest based on observed behavior and resource status, aiming for optimal outcomes in both short-term gains and long-term sustainability. 

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if most players have been Cooperating and the stock is healthy; otherwise, Defect.}}

description_COLLECTIVE_176 = '''
To address the problem of sustaining a shared resource while maximizing individual payoffs in a repeated interaction setting, we can devise a strategic approach that balances cooperation with defection based on observed behavior and current resource levels. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Step 1: Initial Cooperation
- **Action:** Cooperate in the first round.
- **Reasoning:** Starting with cooperation helps establish a baseline of contribution to the shared resource, encouraging others to follow suit.

### Step 2: Monitor Past Behavior
- **Action:** Track the number of Defectors (D_prev) from the previous round.
- **Reasoning:** Observing how many players defected in the last round provides insight into their potential strategies and the current state of cooperation.

### Step 3: Assess Proportion of Defectors
- **Action:** Calculate the proportion of Defectors, p = D_prev / n, where n is the total number of players.
- **Reasoning:** This step helps determine whether a significant portion of the group has shifted towards defection, which could indicate a potential breakdown in cooperation.

### Step 4: Evaluate Resource Health
- **Action:** Check if the current stock level (S_current) is below a predetermined threshold_stock (e.g., 75% of capacity).
- **Reasoning:** Monitoring the resource's health ensures that it remains sustainable. If the stock drops too low, continued cooperation may not be feasible without risking further depletion.

### Step 5: Decision-Making
- **Action:**
  - If p > threshold_defect (e.g., 0.5) OR S_current < threshold_stock:
    - Defect in the current round.
  - Else:
    - Cooperate.
- **Reasoning:** Switching to defection when either too many others are defecting or the resource is critically low serves as a protective measure against exploitation and potential crash of the shared resource.

### Step 6: Adaptation
- **Action:** Periodically reassess thresholds (e.g., threshold_defect, threshold_stock) based on historical data and observed trends in cooperation and resource levels.
- **Reasoning:** Adjusting strategies dynamically allows for better alignment with changing conditions and other players' behaviors over time.

### Example Application:
Consider a scenario with 4 players (n=4), capacity=100, starting stock=100.

- **Round 1:**
  - All Cooperate.
  - Stock remains at 100 after consumption and growth.
  
- **Round 2:**
  - Suppose 2 Defectors and 2 Cooperators.
  - p = 2/4 = 0.5, which meets the threshold_defect of 0.5.
  - Current stock=62.5 (from previous example).
  - Since p >= 0.5 OR stock < 75% capacity:
    - Decide to Defect.

- **Round 3:**
  - If again 2C/2D, stock drops further.
  - Re-evaluate based on updated p and S_current.

### Conclusion:
By strategically balancing cooperation with defection based on observed behavior and resource levels, this approach aims to sustain the shared resource while maximizing individual payoffs over time. Adjusting thresholds dynamically allows for flexibility in adapting to evolving conditions within the group.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_177 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategy where players cooperate by default but defect in response to observed defection. This approach aims to sustain the resource while penalizing those who overconsume. Here's how it works:

### Strategy Steps

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with cooperation in the first round to maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Monitor Consumption**:
   - After each round, calculate the expected consumption if everyone cooperated.
   - Estimate actual consumption based on the change in stock.

3. **Detect Defection**:
   - If actual consumption exceeds expected levels by a threshold, it indicates defection by some players.

4. **Adjust Strategy**:
   - Upon detecting defection, switch to defecting for subsequent rounds.
   - Continue monitoring until cooperation is restored or the resource collapses.

### Final Answer

The strategy involves defaulting to cooperation and switching to defection when evidence of overconsumption is detected. This encourages sustainable use while penalizing those who exploit the resource excessively. The approach is summarized as:

- **First Round**: Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If last round's consumption was higher than expected under cooperation, defect this round.
  - Otherwise, continue cooperating.

Thus, the optimal strategy is encapsulated as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; defect upon detecting overconsumption}}

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategic approach that balances sustainability with maximizing individual payoffs. The strategy adapts to the game's state and players' behaviors dynamically, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Rounds**: Begin by cooperating to maintain the stock at capacity, fostering trust among players.
2. **Monitor Trends**: Track stock levels and cooperation rates to assess sustainability and others' behavior.
3. **Adaptive Actions**:
   - **Cooperate** if the stock is above 70% of capacity and over 75% of other players cooperated recently.
   - **Defect** if the stock drops below 50% or there's significant defection, signaling unsustainability.
4. **Endgame Strategy**: Increase defection in the last few rounds to capitalize on immediate gains as future consequences diminish.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate unconditionally to support a sustainable start.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the current stock relative to capacity.
   - Determine the cooperation rate among other players from recent rounds.
   - If the stock is above 70% and most others cooperate, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock drops below thresholds or cooperation rates fall, switch to defecting.
3. **Final Rounds**: Increase defection tendency as future rounds' impact diminishes.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
function decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock, capacity, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return C
    
    cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(history)
    stock_threshold_high = 0.7 * capacity
    stock_threshold_low = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if stock > stock_threshold_high and cooperation_rate > 0.75:
        return C
    elif stock < stock_threshold_low or cooperation_rate < 0.25:
        return D
    else:
        # Adjust based on remaining rounds
        if (total_rounds - round_number) <= 0.1 * total_rounds:
            return D with higher probability
        else:
            return C
    
function calculate_cooperation_rate(history):
    recent_rounds = last_5_rounds(history)
    cooperation_count = sum(player_actions == 'C' for actions in recent_rounds for player_actions in actions)
    return cooperation_count / (n_players * len(recent_rounds))
```

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round**: Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
- **Last Rounds**: Increase defection as future consequences are less significant.
- **Stock Collapse**: If stock drops critically, consider defecting to maximize immediate gains.

This strategy aims to sustain the resource while adapting to others' behaviors and game dynamics, ensuring a balance between cooperation and individual payoff maximization.

description_COLLECTIVE_179 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to promote sustainable cooperation while adaptively responding to potential defection. Here's a structured summary of the approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating (C) to encourage others to do the same, fostering a sustainable resource base.
2. **Adaptive Response:** Monitor the stock's state after each round. If consumption exceeds a threshold (indicating possible defection), reduce cooperation in subsequent rounds.
3. **Endgame Adjustment:** Gradually shift towards more Defection (D) in the last few rounds to balance short-term gains without causing resource collapse.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Default action is Cooperate (C).
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If stock remains above 0.8 × capacity after a round, continue Cooperating.
  - If stock drops below this threshold, adjust future actions towards Defecting based on the severity of overconsumption.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Last Few Rounds:** Increase tendency to Defect as rounds near the end, balancing immediate gains with sustainability.
- **Stock Collapse:** If the resource is nearly depleted, switch to Defecting to maximize remaining payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_history, opponent_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        previous_stock = stock_history[-2]
        current_stock = stock_history[-1]
        consumption = previous_stock - (current_stock + growth)
        
        if consumption < threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            defect_prob = min(1, (consumption - threshold) / max_consumption)
            return random.choices(['D', 'C'], weights=[defect_prob, 1-defect_prob])[0]
```

### Summary:
This strategy balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with adaptive responses to potential defection. By monitoring the stock's health and adjusting actions accordingly, it promotes a stable resource base while allowing players to optimize their payoffs without complete collapse. The approach is robust against various opponent behaviors and ensures adaptability across different game dynamics.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperative-Defection Based on Stock Levels and Opponent Behavior**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - Start by Cooperating (C) in the first few rounds to encourage a healthy stock level and build a cooperative environment.

2. **Monitoring Mechanisms:**
   - Track the stock level after each round.
   - Observe the proportion of Defect (D) actions from other players over the past 5 rounds.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - The current stock is above 80% of capacity.
     - Less than 30% of recent opponent actions were D.
   - **Defect** if:
     - The stock drops below 60% of capacity.
     - More than 50% of recent opponent actions were D.

4. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - Always Defect to maximize individual payoff as the game is nearing conclusion, regardless of the stock level.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock_level, opponent_history):
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate
    if round_number < 0.2 * total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent defect rate
    recent_defect_rate = sum(1 for action in opponent_history[-5:] if action == 'D') / 5
    
    # Check stock threshold
    if stock_level > 0.8 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    elif stock_level < 0.6 * capacity or recent_defect_rate > 0.5:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Maintain current strategy based on past behavior
        return 'C' if recent_defect_rate < 0.3 else 'D'
    
    # Endgame: Defect
    if round_number >= 0.9 * total_rounds:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
This strategy begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource level. It adapts by monitoring both the stock's health and opponents' actions, switching to defection when necessary to prevent overexploitation or exploitation by others. In the final stages of the game, it prioritizes individual gain by defecting, ensuring maximum payoff as the game concludes.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_181 = '''
To effectively manage the balance between cooperation and defection based on observed player behavior and the state of the shared resource, I propose the following structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy begins with an initial cooperative move to encourage others to follow suit. Subsequent moves adapt based on the current stock level and recent player behavior, ensuring that cooperation is maintained when possible while defecting in response to exploitation or resource depletion.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Initial Move:**
   - In the first round, choose to Cooperate (C). This sets a positive precedent and incentivizes others to cooperate as well.

2. **Subsequent Moves (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **High Stock Condition:** If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, Cooperate. A healthy resource level suggests that cooperation can sustain without immediate risk.
   - **Low Stock Condition:** If the stock is below 25% of capacity, Defect. This prevents further depletion and maximizes individual gain before potential collapse.
   - **Moderate Stock Condition:** When the stock is between 25% and 75%:
     - Count the number of players who Defected in the previous round (D_prev).
     - If the ratio of Defectors (D_prev / n) exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%), choose to Defect. This counters exploitation by those defecting.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate to support resource sustainability.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Treat the final round similarly to others but with an adjusted threshold:
     - If the stock is above half of capacity, Cooperate to preserve what remains.
     - If below, decide based on previous rounds' Defectors, possibly defecting if exploitation was persistent.

### Adjustments for Different Group Sizes:
- **Small Groups (e.g., n=4):** Lower the defect threshold (e.g., 25%) as fewer defectors can significantly impact the resource.
- **Larger Groups:** Maintain or slightly increase the threshold to avoid overreacting to isolated defection instances.

### Rationale:
This strategy prioritizes maintaining a healthy resource by default, only defecting when necessary due to either low stock levels or significant exploitation. It balances individual gain with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation and resource collapse.

### Final Answer:

The proposed strategy is encapsulated as follows:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate.
2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   - If current stock ≥ 75% of capacity: Cooperate.
   - Else if current stock ≤ 25% of capacity: Defect.
   - Otherwise:
     - Count previous round's Defectors (D_prev).
     - If D_prev / n > 30%: Defect.
     - Else: Cooperate.
3. **Last Round (r):**
   - If current stock ≥ 50% of capacity: Cooperate.
   - Else: Choose based on prior Defectors, leaning towards Defect if exploitation was persistent.

**Answer:** The strategy is to initially cooperate and then adapt based on the resource level and others' actions. Cooperate when the stock is high or cooperation prevails; defect when the stock is low or many are defecting. This approach balances sustaining the resource with protecting against exploitation, implemented as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock is above 75% or fewer than 30% Defected last round; otherwise Defect.}}

To address the problem of promoting cooperation in a dynamic environment where players might defect for self-interest, we propose a strategic approach that balances punishment of defection with encouragement of cooperation. The strategy adapts to both past behavior and current resource levels, aiming to maintain sustainability.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.
2. **Monitor Past Behavior:** In subsequent rounds, assess the previous round's defection rate among all players.
3. **Set Defection Tolerance Levels:** Based on the current stock level:
   - If the stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), tolerate a higher defection rate (e.g., 30%) before deciding to defect.
   - If the stock is below this threshold, lower the tolerance (e.g., 10%) to encourage stricter cooperation and prevent further depletion.
4. **Adjust Tolerance for Final Rounds:** In the last few rounds, slightly increase the critical threshold to be cautious with remaining resources.
5. **Decision Making:** If the previous round's defection rate exceeds the set tolerance, defect in the current round to signal disapproval and encourage others to cooperate. Otherwise, continue cooperating.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, n, capacity, r):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate previous defection rate
    prev_defect_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'D')
    p_defect = prev_defect_count / n
    
    # Determine critical thresholds based on current stock and game progression
    critical_threshold = 0.5 * capacity  # Example, adjust as needed
    if round_number > r - 2:  # Last two rounds
        critical_threshold = 0.7 * capacity  # Be a bit more cautious
    
    # Decide tolerance based on current stock level (assuming current_stock is known)
    current_stock = get_current_stock()  # Function to retrieve current stock value
    if current_stock < critical_threshold:
        tolerance = 0.1  # Only tolerate 10% defection
    else:
        tolerance = 0.3  # Tolerate up to 30% defection
    
    # If previous defection rate exceeds tolerance, defect this round
    if p_defect > tolerance:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

**Answer:**

The proposed strategy effectively balances cooperation and defection by adapting to past behavior and current resource levels. By setting dynamic tolerance thresholds based on stock conditions, it promotes sustainable cooperation while deterring widespread defection.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; defect if previous defection rate exceeds a threshold adjusted for current stock level}}$

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperator-Defector (ACD)

The ACD strategy balances between cooperation for sustainable resource use and defection to maximize immediate payoffs when necessary. It adapts based on the current stock level, trends over time, and recent player behavior.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate to establish a baseline of sustainability.

2. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

3. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Smoothed Stock Check:** Calculate an exponential moving average of the stock history to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
     - If the smoothed stock is above 75% of capacity and increasing, Cooperate.
     - If between 25% and 75% of capacity:
       - Cooperate if more than half of players Cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, Defect.
     - If below 25%, always Defect.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(stock_history, last_round_actions):
    capacity = given_parameter
    current_round = len(stock_history) + 1

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # First round: Cooperate

    # Calculate smoothed stock using exponential moving average
    alpha = 0.5  # Smoothing factor
    if len(stock_history) > 1:
        smoothed_stock = alpha * stock_history[-1] + (1 - alpha) * stock_history[-2]
    else:
        smoothed_stock = stock_history[-1]

    threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity

    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'  # Last round: Defect

    if smoothed_stock > threshold_high and is_increasing(stock_history):
        return 'C'
    elif threshold_low <= smoothed_stock <= threshold_high:
        # Check cooperation rate in the last round
        cooperators = sum(1 for a in last_round_actions if a == 'C')
        if cooperators / len(last_round_actions) > 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Below threshold_low
        return 'D'

def is_increasing(stock_history):
    if len(stock_history) < 2:
        return True
    return stock_history[-1] >= stock_history[-2]
```

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize payoff without future repercussions.
- **Stock Near Thresholds:** Use smoothed averages to prevent volatility-driven oscillations between cooperation and defection.

### Robustness:

ACD is robust because it:
1. Encourages cooperation when the resource is healthy.
2. Adapts to cooperate or defect based on others' recent actions, preventing free-riding.
3. Maximizes immediate gains when resources are scarce, encouraging players to act before potential collapse.

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by promoting sustainability while remaining adaptive to varying conditions and player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_184 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource level while balancing individual gains, we propose a strategy where each player independently decides their action (Cooperate or Defect) based on the current stock level and its trend. The strategy uses predefined thresholds and trends to encourage collective cooperation unless forced by others' defection.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Each player initializes with an empty history of observed stock levels.
   - Define two thresholds:
     - Upper threshold (Cooperate Threshold): 75% of the capacity.
     - Lower threshold (Defect Threshold): 25% of the capacity.

2. **First Round Action:**
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate to start with a sustainable approach.

3. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - For each subsequent round:
     - Record the current stock level.
     - Calculate the trend by comparing the current stock with the previous rounds (e.g., using a moving average over the last three rounds).

4. **Decision Rules Based on Stock Level and Trend:**
   - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity:
     - Choose to Cooperate, promoting sustainability.
   - If the current stock is below 25% of capacity:
     - Choose to Defect, as the resource is nearing depletion, maximizing immediate payoff.
   - If the current stock is between 25% and 75% of capacity:
     - Check the trend of the stock over recent rounds.
     - If the stock is increasing (positive trend): Continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability.
     - If the stock is decreasing or stable: Choose to Defect, indicating that others are likely defecting, necessitating a shift towards maximizing individual payoff.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate to start sustainably.
   - Treat all rounds similarly without knowing which is the last round.
   - If the current stock exactly matches one of the thresholds, default to Cooperate to encourage sustainability.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, history):
    threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity
    
    if len(history) == 0:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Calculate trend based on last three rounds
    recent_stocks = history[-3:] + [current_stock]
    average_trend = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
    previous_average = sum(history[-4:-1]) / 3 if len(history) >=4 else current_stock
    
    trend = average_trend - previous_average
    
    if current_stock >= threshold_high:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif current_stock <= threshold_low:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        # Between thresholds, decide based on trend
        if trend > 0:
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Defect"
```

**Conclusion:**
This strategy ensures that each player independently contributes to maintaining a sustainable resource level by Cooperating when the stock is high and defecting only when necessary. By monitoring trends, players adapt dynamically to others' actions, promoting collective cooperation while being resilient against defection attempts.

The strategy is designed to maximize payoffs by balancing resource sustainability and exploitation, adapting dynamically based on the game's state:

### Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

1. **Initial Rounds (Cooperation Phase):**
   - Cooperate when the current stock \( S \) is above 50% of the maximum capacity (\( S > 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \)) and it's not one of the last few rounds.
   - This phase aims to sustain the resource, ensuring long-term benefits.

2. **Endgame Exploitation (Defection Phase):**
   - Defect in the last two rounds regardless of the stock level to maximize immediate gains as there are no future rounds to penalize overconsumption.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - If the stock falls below 50% capacity, switch to defecting to prevent further depletion and capture remaining resources before they diminish.
   - This adjustment helps in scenarios where other players might be defecting excessively, leading to rapid resource degradation.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, capacity):
    # Determine if it's one of the last two rounds
    is_last_two = (total_rounds - round_number) <= 1
    
    # Check if current stock is above the threshold and not in the endgame
    if not is_last_two and current_stock >= 0.5 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Cooperation Phase:** By cooperating when the stock is sufficiently high, the strategy supports sustainable resource management, allowing for regeneration each round.
- **Endgame Exploitation:** Switching to defecting in the final rounds ensures players maximize their payoffs without worrying about future depletions.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** If the stock unexpectedly drops below a critical threshold, the strategy adapts by defecting to mitigate further damage and capitalize on remaining resources.

This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors, as it reacts to observable state changes rather than relying on assumptions about others' strategies. It balances long-term sustainability with short-term gain optimization, making it effective across different game dynamics.

The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation with defection adaptively, ensuring sustainability while protecting against exploitation. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Strategy Overview
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by always cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage a cooperative environment and sustain the resource.

2. **Adaptive Thresholds**:
   - **Stock Threshold**: Cooperate if the current stock is above 75% of capacity. Defect if it drops below this threshold.
   - **Defector Proportion**: If more than 30% of other players defect in a round, switch to defection for subsequent rounds.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - Each round assesses the current stock and the proportion of defectors. Adjust actions based on these thresholds to either cooperate or defect.

4. **Final Round Handling**: Cooperate even in the last round to maintain long-term sustainability norms, encouraging others not to defect earlier.

### Rationale
- **Sustainability Focus**: Cooperating maintains a stable resource level, providing consistent payoffs.
- **Protection Against Exploitation**: Switching to defection when too many others defect prevents being exploited and encourages mutual cooperation.
- **Threshold-Based Adaptation**: The strategy dynamically responds to the state of the resource and other players' actions, promoting stability and resilience.

### Expected Outcomes
- Encourages collective cooperation, maintaining high stock levels and steady payoffs.
- Mitigates rapid depletion caused by defecting behavior, ensuring longer-term sustainability.

This strategy aims to maximize collective benefits while being robust against various player behaviors, fostering a balance between individual gain and group welfare.

description_COLLECTIVE_187 = '''
The optimal strategy for the AI is to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to maintain a high stock level and stable payoffs.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: For each subsequent round, assess the current stock level relative to a predetermined threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity). If the stock is above this threshold, continue to cooperate.

3. **Defection Threshold**: If the stock drops below the threshold, switch to defecting. This indicates that there's either excessive consumption due to defection or insufficient sustainable resource levels.

4. **Adapt Based on Past Actions**: Track the number of defectors in previous rounds. If more than half of the players defected in prior rounds, it signals a breakdown in cooperation. In such cases, defecting becomes advantageous as others are likely doing the same, maximizing immediate payoffs despite future consequences.

5. **Final Round Defection**: Always defect in the last round since there's no future impact to consider, allowing for maximum immediate gain without worrying about resource sustainability.

By following this strategy, the AI adapts dynamically to both current game states and historical player behavior, ensuring a balance between short-term gains and long-term resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_188 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Stock-Based Strategy**

The strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable resource management by adapting based on the current stock level and its trends.

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate when the stock is below 60% of capacity or decreasing rapidly to allow regrowth.
   - Defect when the stock is above 60% of capacity and stable to maximize payoff without risking depletion.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Start by defecting as the stock is full, allowing maximum immediate gain.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Adjust to cooperate if others are maintaining cooperation to sustain higher payoffs; otherwise, defect.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Monitor the average stock trend over recent rounds. If the stock is decreasing rapidly, lower the threshold to encourage earlier cooperation.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decision(current_stock, capacity, n_players, history):
    # Parameters
    threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    trend_window = 5  # Number of past rounds to consider for trend

    # Determine recent stock trend
    if len(history) > trend_window:
        recent_stocks = [h['stock'] for h in history[-trend_window:]]
        avg_stock_change = sum(recent_stocks)/len(recent_stocks)
    else:
        avg_stock_change = current_stock  # Use current stock as initial trend

    # Check if stock is decreasing rapidly
    rapid_decrease = (current_stock - avg_stock_change) < -0.1 * capacity

    # Decision logic
    if current_stock > threshold and not rapid_decrease:
        return 'D'  # Defect for higher payoff
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to help replenish

# Example usage in each round:
current_stock = game_state['stock']
action = decision(current_stock, capacity, n_players, game_history)
```

This strategy ensures adaptability by dynamically adjusting based on stock levels and trends, promoting cooperation when necessary to sustain resources while defecting for higher payoffs when the resource is abundant.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_189 = '''
To address the problem of resource management with cooperation and defection strategies, we propose setting a threshold based on the current stock relative to its maximum capacity. Specifically:

1. **Threshold Definition**: Players will cooperate if the current stock level is above 50% of the maximum capacity (C). If the stock falls below this threshold, players will defect.

2. **Rationale**:
   - **Cooperation Above Threshold**: Maintaining cooperation when the resource is healthy (above 50%) helps preserve it for future rounds, ensuring steady payoffs.
   - **Defection Below Threshold**: Switching to defection when the resource is depleted below 50% allows players to maximize their share of the remaining resource before it is exhausted.

3. **Implementation**:
   - In each round, assess whether the current stock (S) exceeds 50% of capacity.
     - If S > 0.5C: Cooperate by choosing an action that contributes to sustainable use.
     - If S ≤ 0.5C: Defect by taking as much resource as possible.

4. **Outcome**:
   - This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, preventing rapid depletion while allowing players to adapt when the resource is critically low.

By following this approach, players can optimize their payoffs over time without causing irreversible harm to the shared resource.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock exceeds 50% of capacity; otherwise, defect.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_190 = '''
**Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Response (ACDR)**

1. **Initial Round Action**: Cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative foundation and maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision Rules**:
   - Each player evaluates two factors from the previous round:
     1. The proportion of players who cooperated.
     2. The current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If both conditions are satisfied (more than half cooperated and stock is above a threshold, e.g., 50% of capacity), continue Cooperating.
   - Otherwise, Defect.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to initiate sustainable play.
   - **Last Rounds**: Apply the same decision rules; no special treatment ensures adaptability regardless of round progression.
   - **Low Stock Threshold (e.g., below 25% capacity)**: Switch to Defect to prevent further depletion and focus on immediate gains.

4. **Stock Dynamics Consideration**:
   - Monitor stock growth rates and adjust cooperation based on sustainability, encouraging mutual cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse.

This strategy balances cooperation with adaptability, fostering collective action while responding dynamically to changing conditions and opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_191 = '''
To address the problem of sustaining cooperation while maximizing individual payoff in a multi-player resource management game, the following strategy is proposed. This strategy balances between encouraging cooperation and protecting against resource depletion through defection when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.
2. **Conditional Cooperation**: In subsequent rounds (except the last), Cooperate only if both conditions are met:
   - A substantial majority of players Cooperated in the previous round.
   - The current stock level is sufficiently high to support sustainable growth.
3. **Defection in the Last Round**: Always Defect in the final round to maximize individual payoff, as there's no future punishment.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round (t = 1)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale**: Initiate with a cooperative move to encourage others to follow suit and maintain a healthy resource level.

2. **Middle Rounds (t = 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Determine Previous Cooperation**:
     - Calculate the number of players who Cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Check Current Stock**:
     - Assess if the current stock is above a specified threshold, indicating it's healthy enough for sustainable use.
   - **Decision Making**:
     - If both conditions are met (substantial cooperation and sufficient stock), continue to Cooperate.
     - Otherwise, switch to Defecting to either encourage others to Cooperate or protect against resource depletion.

3. **Last Round (t = r)**:
   - **Action**: Defect (D)
   - **Rationale**: Since there's no future round for retaliation, defecting maximizes individual payoff regardless of others' actions.

### Thresholds:
- **Cooperation Threshold**: Set at 70% of players. This ensures that Cooperating is only done when a significant majority is also Cooperating.
- **Stock Threshold**: Set at 80% of the resource capacity. This indicates a healthy stock level that can sustain use and replenish adequately.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, previous_actions, current_stock, n_players, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number < total_rounds:
        # Calculate number of Cooperators in the previous round
        cooperators = sum(1 for action in previous_actions[-1] if action == 'C')
        threshold_coop = 0.7 * n_players
        threshold_stock = 0.8 * capacity
        if cooperators > threshold_coop and current_stock > threshold_stock:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Last round
        return 'D'
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy encourages cooperation when conditions are favorable, thereby maintaining a healthy resource level and ensuring steady payoffs. It switches to defection when necessary to address potential resource depletion or to incentivize others to Cooperate, balancing individual gain with collective sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_192 = '''
To address the problem, we developed an adaptive strategy that considers both the current state of the resource and the behavior of other players. This strategy aims to encourage cooperation while preventing crashes by responding appropriately to changes in stock levels and cooperation rates.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with cooperation to maintain a healthy resource level.
2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: In subsequent rounds, decide whether to cooperate or defect based on:
   - The current stock level relative to capacity.
   - The proportion of other players who cooperated in the last round.
3. **Endgame Adjustment**: Near the end of the game, prioritize immediate gains by always defecting.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(stock_level, cooperation_rate, remaining_rounds, total_rounds):
    threshold_stock = 0.6 * capacity
    if stock_level >= threshold_stock and cooperation_rate > 0.7:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        # Check endgame condition
        if remaining_rounds <= 0.2 * total_rounds:
            return 'Defect'
        else:
            return 'Defect'

# Example usage within a game loop
capacity = 100  # Assuming capacity is known or can be inferred
total_rounds = 50
current_round = 1

while current_round <= total_rounds:
    stock_level = get_current_stock()  # Function to retrieve current stock level
    cooperation_rate = get_cooperation_rate()  # Function to retrieve other players' cooperation rate
    
    action = decide_action(stock_level, cooperation_rate, (total_rounds - current_round), total_rounds)
    
    # Perform the action and update game state accordingly
    if action == 'Cooperate':
        perform_cooperation()
    else:
        perform_defection()
    
    current_round += 1
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Phase**: The strategy starts with cooperation to maintain a healthy resource level, encouraging others to do the same.
- **Subsequent Rounds**: Players evaluate both the stock level and the cooperation rate of others. If the stock is above a certain threshold (60% capacity) and most others are cooperating, they continue to cooperate. Otherwise, they defect to either signal the need for more cooperation or take advantage of others' defection.
- **Endgame Adjustment**: As the game nears its end (less than 20% of total rounds remaining), players switch to always defecting to maximize their immediate payoffs.

This approach balances between maintaining the resource and responding to others' actions, ensuring adaptability while preventing crashes.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_193 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a balanced approach that combines monitoring current stock health with assessing recent cooperation rates among players. This strategy aims to promote sustainability while adapting to others' behaviors.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Players start by Cooperating in the first 20% of rounds to build trust and maintain resource levels.
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Based on current stock levels, players switch between Cooperating and Defecting using predefined thresholds:
   - **Upper Threshold (Safe Zone)**: If the stock is above this level, players Cooperate if others are also Cooperating; otherwise, they consider Defecting to signal dissatisfaction.
   - **Middle Range**: Players use a Tit-for-Tat approach, mirroring recent cooperation rates. If more than 60% of players Cooperated recently, they continue Cooperating; else, they Defect.
   - **Lower Threshold (Critical Zone)**: When the stock is low, players always Cooperate to prevent further depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, current_round):
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate
    if current_round < 0.2 * r:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate over the last 10 rounds
    recent_coop = sum(history[-last_10_rounds]) / (n * 10)
    
    # Define thresholds for stock health
    lower_threshold = 50  # Example value; adjust based on game parameters
    upper_threshold = 80  # Example value
    
    if current_stock > upper_threshold:
        # Safe to Cooperate if others are also doing so
        if recent_coop >= 0.7:  # 70% of players Cooperated recently
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Others not Cooperating, consider Defecting
            return 'D'
    elif lower_threshold <= current_stock <= upper_threshold:
        # Tit-for-Tat based on recent cooperation
        if recent_coop >= 0.6:  # More than 60% Cooperated
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Stock is low
        # Always Cooperate to prevent further depletion
        return 'C'
```

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Establishes a baseline of trust and sustainability.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adapts player actions based on stock health, encouraging sustainable behavior when resources are abundant and critical conservation when they are low.
- **Tit-for-Tat Approach**: Encourages mutual cooperation by mirroring others' actions, fostering a stable equilibrium.

### Conclusion

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, adapting to collective behaviors while preventing resource depletion. By monitoring stock levels and cooperation rates, players can dynamically adjust their actions to maintain the common pool resource effectively.

description_COLLECTIVE_194 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to encourage sustainable use of the resource.

2. **Sustainability Check:**
   - Monitor the stock level relative to capacity. If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, it's considered sustainable.

3. **Recent Behavior Analysis:**
   - Track cooperation rates in recent rounds (last 3 rounds). If more than 80% of other players have been Cooperating, continue Cooperating if sustainability is maintained.

4. **Adaptive Defection:**
   - If the stock falls below 75% capacity or if less than 80% of others Cooperated in recent rounds, switch to Defecting (D) to prevent resource depletion and exploit higher immediate payoffs.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last three rounds (to account for future punishment absence), prioritize self-interest by defecting unless the stock is significantly high (above 75% capacity), where cooperation might still yield benefits.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(state, history):
    n = state.n
    current_stock = state.stock
    capacity = state.capacity
    round_number = state.round
    total_rounds = state.total_rounds

    # First round default to Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Check if in the last few rounds (last 3)
    if round_number > total_rounds - 3:
        # Tendency to Defect unless stock is very high
        if current_stock < 0.75 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

    # Determine recent cooperation rate from history
    recent_cooperations = count_c(history, n, max(1, round_number - 3), round_number - 1)
    recent_rounds = min(3, round_number - 1)
    cooperation_rate = recent_cooperations / (n * recent_rounds)

    # Decision based on stock and recent behavior
    if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity and cooperation_rate > 0.8:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages sustainable use by starting with cooperation.
- **Sustainability Threshold (75%):** Maintains the resource above a critical level to prevent rapid depletion.
- **Behavioral Adaptation:** Adapts based on others' actions, continuing cooperation if the majority do so and sustainability is met; defects otherwise.
- **Endgame Adjustment:** Recognizes the absence of future punishment in final rounds, adjusting strategies accordingly to maximize individual payoff while considering resource preservation.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term self-interest, adapting dynamically to both resource conditions and peer behavior.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we'll outline a strategic approach that balances cooperation and defection based on the game's state and progression. The strategy is designed to be adaptive, ensuring sustainability of the common pool resource while protecting against exploitation.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating to maintain the resource level.
2. **Endgame Defection**: Near the end of the game, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains.
3. **Stock Thresholds**: Use thresholds (safe and danger levels) to decide between Cooperate and Defect actions based on the current stock level.
4. **Trend Analysis**: Monitor the trend of the stock over recent rounds to determine if cooperation is effective or if defection is necessary.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Always Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline for resource maintenance.

2. **Endgame Behavior**:
   - In the last 20% of rounds, switch to Defecting to exploit the remaining resource without regard for future sustainability.

3. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - **Safe Level**: If the stock is above 70% of capacity, Cooperate to sustain the resource.
   - **Danger Level**: If the stock falls below 30% of capacity, Defect as cooperation is no longer effective.

4. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Between safe and danger levels, assess if the stock trend is decreasing over recent rounds. If so, switch to Defecting.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, n, capacity, history, current_round, r):
    # Initialize thresholds
    safe_level = 0.7 * capacity
    danger_level = 0.3 * capacity
    round_threshold = 0.2 * r  # Switch to defect in last 20% rounds

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if approaching end of game
    rounds_remaining = r - current_round + 1
    if rounds_remaining <= round_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    # Decision based on current stock
    if current_stock >= safe_level:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock <= danger_level:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Check recent trend (last 3 rounds)
        trend_window = min(3, len(history))
        previous_stocks = [s for s in history[-trend_window:]]
        if is_trend_decreasing(previous_stocks):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def is_trend_decreasing(stock_levels):
    # Check if each subsequent stock level is lower than the previous
    for i in range(1, len(stock_levels)):
        if stock_levels[i] >= stock_levels[i-1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by Cooperating to maintain a high resource level, which promotes sustainability.
- **Endgame Defection**: As the game nears its end, players defect to maximize their immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds.
- **Stock Thresholds**: By setting thresholds (70% and 30%), the strategy adapts to the current state of the resource. Cooperation is maintained when the stock is healthy, while defection occurs if the resource becomes critically low.
- **Trend Analysis**: This step ensures that players adapt dynamically by observing recent trends. If the stock consistently decreases despite cooperation, it signals that others are defecting, prompting a switch to defection.

This strategy effectively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to various opponent behaviors while aligning with collective interests in maintaining the resource pool when possible.

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative Strategy (ACS)**

**Objective:**  
Maximize long-term payoff by fostering sustainable cooperation while being resilient to exploitation.

---

### **Decision Rules**

#### 1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - Rationale: Start with cooperation to promote resource sustainability and allow stock growth.
  - Pseudocode:
    ```python
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    ```

#### 2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
- **Cooperate if:**
  - The stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
  - At least 60% of players cooperated in the previous round.
  - Rationale: Maintain cooperation when resources are abundant and others are contributing sustainably.

- **Defect if:**
  - The stock is below the critical threshold.
  - Fewer than 40% of players cooperated in the previous round.
  - Rationale: Defend against exploitation by defecting when cooperation is low or resources are scarce.

#### 3. **Final Round (Round r):**
- **Action:** Defect (D)
  - Rationale: Exploit remaining resources without concern for future rounds, as there are none left.
  - Pseudocode:
    ```python
    if current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    ```

---

### **Adaptive Thresholds**
Adjust the critical stock threshold based on historical data to ensure robustness:
- If stock consistently remains above capacity * 0.85, lower the threshold to encourage more cooperation.
- If stock frequently drops below capacity * 0.75, raise the threshold to prevent over-exploitation.

---

### **Edge Cases**

#### 1. **Stock Near Capacity:**
- **Action:** Cooperate
  - Rationale: High stock levels indicate sustainability; continue contributing to growth.

#### 2. **Stock Close to Zero:**
- **Action:** Defect
  - Rationale: Minimal resources left; maximize personal gain in the last possible round before collapse.

---

### **Collective Mindset**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Start by cooperating to build a foundation for mutual benefits and sustainable resource use.

2. **Adaptive Play:**
   - Monitor stock levels and others' actions.
   - Cooperate when resources are plentiful and others contribute sustainably.
   - Defect if resources dwindle or too many players exploit the pool.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Retaliate against defectors by defecting in subsequent rounds to balance exploitation.

4. **Last Round Exploitation:**
   - Maximize gains in the final round without concern for future sustainability.

---

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track stock after each round and adjust thresholds accordingly.
2. **Analyze Previous Round Actions:** Note the number of Cooperators vs Defectors to inform current decisions.
3. **Adapt Thresholds:** Modify critical thresholds based on historical performance to optimize outcomes.

---

### **Pseudocode Summary**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        # Calculate critical thresholds based on historical data
        critical_threshold = adjust_critical_threshold(history)
        
        # Check cooperation rate in previous round
        prev_coop_rate = get_previous_cooperation_rate(history)
        
        if stock > critical_threshold and prev_coop_rate >= 0.6:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"

def adjust_critical_threshold(history):
    # Logic to adjust threshold based on historical stock levels
    pass

def get_previous_cooperation_rate(history):
    # Calculate cooperation rate in the previous round
    pass
```

---

### **Summary**

The Adaptive Cooperative Strategy (ACS) balances initial cooperation with adaptive behavior to sustain resources and maximize payoffs. By monitoring stock levels and player actions, it dynamically adjusts between cooperation and defection, ensuring resilience against various opponent behaviors while promoting collective sustainability.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation based on Stock Health**

1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1 to r - k)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate in the first round to maintain a healthy stock level.
   - **Monitoring**: After each round, evaluate the new stock level and growth rate.
   - **Threshold Check**: If the stock remains above a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), continue Cooperating. If below this threshold, switch to Defecting for the next few rounds.

2. **Late Rounds (Last k Rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Switch to Defecting regardless of the stock level, as there are limited future rounds left to maximize immediate payoffs.

3. **Dynamic Adaptation**:
   - After defecting for a set number of rounds (e.g., 2-3), reassess the stock.
     - If it has recovered above the threshold, return to Cooperating.
     - If not, continue Defecting cautiously until recovery or end of game.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - In the first round, always Cooperate to start sustainably.
   - If the stock drops extremely low (e.g., below 20%), stop defecting and focus on minimal consumption to allow some growth if possible.

5. **Consideration of Other Players' Actions**:
   - While primarily relying on stock levels, consider historical data on other players' actions. If a significant proportion (e.g., over 50%) are Defecting, it may signal the need for a strategic shift.

6. **Implementation Note**:
   - Use a weighted average of recent rounds' stock levels to make decisions smoother rather than relying solely on single-round thresholds.

This strategy aims to balance individual gains with collective sustainability by dynamically adapting based on the resource's health and other players' actions. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and switches to defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse, ensuring adaptability throughout the game.

**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to encourage sustainable play and set a positive precedent.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **Stock Level Assessment:**
      - **High Stock (Above 80% of Capacity):** Cooperate to maintain the resource's health, promoting long-term sustainability.
      - **Medium Stock (40%-80% of Capacity):** 
        - If the stock is increasing towards higher levels, continue Cooperating.
        - If decreasing below 60%, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains and prevent further depletion.
      - **Low Stock (Below 40% of Capacity):** Always Defect to secure as much payoff as possible before potential resource collapse.

3. **Behavior Adjustment:**
   - Focus on the trend of stock levels rather than individual player actions, using historical data to inform decisions without mid-round adjustments.

4. **Final Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - Switch to always Defecting to maximize immediate gains, considering there's no future round impact beyond these rounds.

**Summary:**

This strategy balances individual self-interest with collective sustainability by adapting to the resource's state. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and shifts towards defection as the resource depletes or trends downward. The approach ensures adaptability without reliance on others' strategies, focusing instead on observable stock trends.

The strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to the state of the common pool and past player behaviors. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round:** Start with Cooperation (C) to promote sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - Track recent cooperation rates among players.
3. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate if the stock is above a threshold and recent cooperation is high.
   - Defect if the stock is low or there's significant recent defection.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Starting with cooperation helps maintain a sustainable resource level, encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1: Assess Stock Level**
     - Define thresholds (e.g., 80% of capacity as healthy, 50% as stressed).
   - **Step 2: Evaluate Recent Cooperation**
     - Track the proportion of Cooperations in the last few rounds.
   - **Decision:**
     - If stock is above threshold and cooperation rate is high (>60%), Cooperate (C).
     - If stock drops below threshold or cooperation rate falls significantly, consider Defecting (D) to prevent over-depletion.

3. **Endgame (Last Few Rounds):**
   - Players may be tempted to defect for higher immediate payoffs.
   - Strategy: Adjust based on remaining rounds and current stock:
     - If close to zero stock, Cooperate minimally.
     - Otherwise, balance between Cooperating and Defecting based on future impact.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock, capacity, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.5 * capacity
    
    recent_coop_rate = calculate_recent_cooperation(history)
    
    if stock > threshold_high and recent_coop_rate > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    elif stock < threshold_low or recent_coop_rate < 0.4:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Adjust based on remaining rounds
        if round_number >= total_rounds - 2:
            if stock == capacity:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D' if random.random() > 0.5 else 'C'
        else:
            return 'C'

def calculate_recent_cooperation(history):
    recent_rounds = history[-min(10, len(history)):]
    coop_count = sum(1 for action in recent_rounds if action == 'C')
    return coop_count / len(recent_rounds) if recent_rounds else 0
```

### Summary:
This strategy promotes sustainability by initially Cooperating and adapting based on the stock's health and recent player behaviors. It dynamically adjusts to prevent over-depletion while considering endgame scenarios to balance immediate and future payoffs.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Retaliation**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff while maintaining sustainable resource levels through dynamic cooperation and controlled defection.

---

### **Decision Rules:**
1. **Cooperate** if:
   - Current stock is above 80% of capacity.
   - Recent cooperation rate (last 5 rounds) exceeds 70%.

2. **Defect** if:
   - Current stock falls below 60% of capacity.
   - Recent cooperation rate drops below 30%, especially in the last few rounds.

3. **Adjust Thresholds Dynamically:**
   - Increase cooperation threshold by 10% after consecutive cooperative rounds with positive stock growth.
   - Decrease defect trigger by 10% if defection leads to significant resource depletion.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others and set a positive precedent.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds):** Adjust strategy based on current stock and cooperation rates. If cooperation is high, continue; otherwise, defect cautiously.

---

### **Collective Strategy Alignment:**
Encourage sustainability by rewarding cooperation with continued cooperation. Retaliatory defection against frequent defectors aims to reset the balance towards collective resource preservation without spiraling into mutual depletion.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, recent_actions, rounds_remaining):
    capacity = 100  # Example value; adjust based on game parameters
    cooperation_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    defect_trigger = 0.6 * capacity
    memory_length = 5

    # Calculate recent cooperation rate
    total_players = len(recent_actions[0]) if recent_actions else n
    cooperation_count = sum([sum(actions == 'C') for actions in recent_actions])
    cooperation_rate = cooperation_count / (total_players * min(len(recent_actions), memory_length))

    # Decision logic
    if current_stock > cooperation_threshold and cooperation_rate > 0.7:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < defect_trigger or (rounds_remaining < 5 and cooperation_rate < 0.3):
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# Dynamic threshold adjustment (to be applied after each round)
def adjust_thresholds(current_stock, action, payoff):
    global cooperation_threshold, defect_trigger
    if action == 'C' and current_stock > cooperation_threshold:
        cooperation_threshold *= 1.10
    elif action == 'D' and current_stock < defect_trigger:
        defect_trigger *= 0.90

# Example usage in a round
current_stock = get_current_stock()
recent_actions = get_recent_actions(memory_length)
rounds_remaining = total_rounds - current_round
action = decide_action(current_stock, recent_actions, rounds_remaining)
adjust_thresholds(current_stock, action, payoff_received)
```

---

### **Conclusion:**
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adapting to resource levels and player behavior. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and employs controlled defection to manage exploitation, aiming for a stable equilibrium that benefits all players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_201 = '''
**Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, choose to Cooperate (C). This encourages others to also cooperate and helps sustain the common pool resource.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
   - Define a threshold level of the stock, set at 50% of the capacity. This is where growth peaks, making it optimal for sustaining the resource.
   - In each subsequent round:
     - If the current stock is above the threshold (≥ 50% of capacity), continue Cooperating (C) to support sustainable consumption.
     - If the current stock is below the threshold (< 50% of capacity), switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff before potential resource collapse.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - As the game progresses, adjust the threshold based on the number of rounds remaining. In later rounds, lower the threshold slightly to become more inclined towards defecting, as future payoffs matter less.

4. **Expectation and Adaptation:**
   - After each round where you cooperate, calculate the expected stock level if everyone had cooperated.
   - Compare this with the actual stock:
     - If actual stock is significantly lower than expected, infer that others are defecting. Start defecting in future rounds to maximize your payoff.
     - If actual stock meets or exceeds expectations, continue cooperating.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., 10% of total rounds remaining), prioritize maximizing immediate payoffs by defecting more aggressively, as there are no future rounds to benefit from sustainable consumption.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decision_rule(round_number, stock_level, capacity, n, r):
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity  # Initial threshold at 50% of capacity
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Adjust threshold dynamically as rounds progress
    if round_number > r / 2:
        threshold *= (r - round_number) / r  # Lower threshold in later rounds
    
    # Calculate expected stock if everyone cooperated last round
    expected_stock = (stock_level + previous_growth)
    
    # Compare actual and expected stock
    if stock_level < expected_stock * 0.8:  # If actual is significantly lower
        return 'D'
    else:
        if stock_level >= threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages others to maintain the resource, promoting a sustainable outcome.
- **Threshold-Based Switching:** Balances between sustaining the resource and defecting when overexploitation is detected, adapting to others' strategies.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Accounts for the diminishing importance of future payoffs as the game progresses.
- **Expectation Comparison:** Detects cooperation levels among players, allowing adaptation to changing behaviors.
- **Endgame Aggression:** Maximizes immediate gains in the final rounds when future rounds no longer provide benefits.

This strategy aims to maximize total payoff by balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to the game's progression and others' actions.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff over multiple rounds while maintaining a sustainable resource level.

**Strategy Overview:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Start with Cooperating in the first round to observe others' behavior and maintain stock stability.
- **Adaptive Behavior:** Adjust actions based on observed cooperation rates, remaining rounds, and current stock levels.
- **Endgame Adjustment:** Near the end of the game, switch to Defecting as future penalties are minimized.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate to establish a baseline and observe others' actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-3):**
   - **Cooperation Rate:** Track the proportion of players who Cooperated in previous rounds.
     - If cooperation rate > threshold (e.g., 70%), consider Defecting occasionally for higher payoffs.
     - If cooperation rate ≤ threshold, Cooperate more frequently to stabilize the stock.
   - **Stock Level Check:**
     - If current stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), consider Defecting as growth can compensate for consumption.
     - If below this threshold, Cooperate to prevent further depletion and aid regrowth.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Rounds r-2 to r):**
   - Switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future impacts.

**Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Unilaterally Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Focus on maximizing individual payoff by defecting, as there are no long-term consequences.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use thresholds (e.g., 70% cooperation rate, 50% stock level) to decide actions adaptively.
- Balance between exploiting Cooperation and contributing to sustainability based on observed behavior and resource levels.

This strategy aims to be robust against various opponent behaviors by dynamically adjusting actions, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term resource health.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Threshold Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

To address the challenges of the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive threshold strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on observed trends in stock levels. This strategy aims to maintain sustainability while preventing over-depletion.

### **Strategy Overview**

The strategy uses dynamic thresholds to decide between Cooperating (C) and Defecting (D). It adapts based on the current stock level relative to capacity and recent changes, ensuring sustainable resource use.

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Sets a cooperative tone, promoting sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Calculate Current Stock Relative to Capacity (SR):** SR = (Current Stock / Capacity) * 100
   - **Determine Recent Trend:**
     - Compare SR with the previous round's stock relative to capacity.
   - **Adjust Action Based on Thresholds:**
     - **Coop Threshold (CT):** If SR > CT and stable/increasing, Cooperate.
     - **Defect Threshold (DT):** If SR < DT or significant drop, Defect.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - **Base Values:** CT = 80%, DT = 70% (adjustable based on game parameters)
   - **Adjust for Player Count (n):** Lower thresholds if n increases to account for higher potential depletion.

4. **Last Round Handling:**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximizes individual payoff with no future rounds, preventing others from exploiting the resource.

### **Pseudocode**

```python
def decide_action(round_history):
    n = game_params['n']
    capacity = game_params['capacity']
    
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if not round_history:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate current and previous stock levels relative to capacity
    current_stock = round_history[-1]['stock_after_growth']
    prev_stock = round_history[-2]['stock_after_growth'] if len(round_history) > 1 else capacity
    
    SR_current = (current_stock / capacity) * 100
    SR_prev = (prev_stock / capacity) * 100
    
    # Determine thresholds, adjusted for n
    CT = max(75, 80 - (n/2))  # Example adjustment
    DT = max(60, 70 - (n/2))
    
    # Check stock trend and decide action
    if SR_current > CT and SR_prev <= SR_current:
        return 'C'
    elif SR_current < DT or SR_prev - SR_current > 5:  # Significant drop
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'  # Default to Cooperate when uncertain

# Example usage:
round_history = [{'stock_after_growth': 90}, {'stock_after_growth': 85}]
action = decide_action(round_history)
print(action)  # Output: 'C' or 'D'
```

### **Rationale**

- **Cooperation Promotion:** Encourages sustainability when the stock is healthy.
- **Defection Prevention:** Protects against over-depletion by adapting to significant drops in stock levels.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Thresholds adjust based on player count, ensuring relevance across different game setups.

This strategy balances individual payoff with collective resource management, fostering a sustainable approach while being responsive to changing conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_204 = '''
To develop an effective strategy in the context of resource management within a discrete game framework, the following organized approach is proposed:

### Strategy Overview

The strategy balances between preserving the resource for long-term gains and maximizing immediate payoff when necessary. It adapts based on observed outcomes (stock levels) rather than relying on assumptions about other players' strategies.

### Key Components

1. **Initial Cooperation**
   - Begin by Cooperating in the initial rounds to establish a baseline of sustainable resource use.

2. **Threshold-Based Monitoring**
   - Establish thresholds to determine when to switch between Cooperating and Defecting.
     - **Lower Threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity):** If the stock drops below this level, it indicates overuse by others; switch to Defecting.
     - **Upper Threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity):** If the stock recovers above this level, indicating sustainable use, switch back to Cooperating.

3. **State Switching with Hysteresis**
   - Use hysteresis to prevent oscillation:
     - Switch to Defecting when the stock is below the lower threshold.
     - Return to Cooperating only when the stock exceeds the upper threshold.

4. **Late-Round Exploitation**
   - In the final 20% of rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff as future benefits diminish.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Rounds (First k Rounds)**
   - Choose to Cooperate to support sustainable resource use and observe the baseline stock behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Middle Phase)**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to the thresholds.
     - If below 80%: Switch state to Defecting.
     - If above 90%: Return to Cooperating.
   - Maintain the current state if within the threshold range.

3. **Final Rounds (Last m Rounds)**
   - Always choose to Defect to capitalize on remaining resources without regard for long-term sustainability.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider a game with 50 rounds, capacity = 100 units, and n=4 players.

- **Rounds 1-10:** Cooperate. Observe stock behavior.
- **Rounds 11-40:**
  - If stock <80%: Defect.
  - If stock >90%: Cooperate.
  - Else: Continue current state.
- **Rounds 41-50:** Always Defect.

### Conclusion

This strategy is designed to adapt dynamically, ensuring resource sustainability while maximizing personal payoff when necessary. By focusing on observable outcomes rather than others' strategies, it provides a robust approach to balancing immediate and long-term gains in competitive environments.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_205 = '''
The optimal strategy for balancing immediate gains and long-term sustainability in this scenario involves starting with cooperation to maintain the resource and adaptively switching to defection based on observed trends. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in early rounds to sustain the resource and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Monitor Stock Trends**: Track changes in the stock level over time. If the stock consistently decreases despite cooperation, it may indicate that other players are defecting more frequently.
3. **Adaptive Defection**:
   - If the current stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoffs before the resource is depleted.
   - If there's a significant trend of decreasing stock, indicating others are defecting, gradually shift towards defecting more often.
4. **Sustainability Check**: After defecting, if the stock begins to recover or stabilize (possibly due to others adjusting their strategies), revert back to cooperation.
5. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always cooperate to start sustainably.
   - **Last Few Rounds**: Defect to maximize payoff since there's no future impact.

### Decision Rule Implementation:
- **Cooperate** if:
  - It's the first round.
  - The current stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) and has been stable or increasing in recent rounds.
  - Observing that cooperation leads to sustainable growth.
  
- **Defect** if:
  - The current stock is below a critical level (e.g., 50% of capacity).
  - There's a significant trend of decreasing stock over time, indicating others are defecting more.
  - In the last few rounds, defect to maximize payoff.

### Considerations:
- **Thresholds and Trends**: Choose thresholds and trends that allow cooperation as long as possible without letting the resource dwindle too much.
- **Gradual Shift**: If switching from cooperate to defect, consider a gradual shift to prevent sudden stock drops. However, without coordination, this may be challenging, so simpler rules based on observable state changes are practical.

### Conclusion:
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by starting with cooperation and adaptively switching behaviors based on observed resource trends. It handles edge cases appropriately and is robust against different opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_206 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining sustainable resource exploitation among players, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level relative to a predefined threshold.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define the Threshold (T):**
   - Set T at 50% of the total capacity (C). This threshold represents the minimum stock level required to sustain cooperation and ensure resource recovery through growth.

2. **Determine Player Action:**
   - At each round, check the current stock level (S).
   - If S ≥ T, players Cooperate by consuming a moderate amount, allowing for sustainable use.
   - If S < T, players Defect by maximizing their consumption to exploit the remaining resource before potential collapse.

3. **Implementation of Strategy:**
   - Players observe the current stock and past actions to decide their move.
   - By following this rule, players ensure that when resources are abundant (above 50%), cooperation prevents overexploitation, promoting long-term sustainability. When resources dip below this level, defection is justified as a response to an impending scarcity.

**Answer:**

Players should Cooperate if the current stock is at least half of the total capacity; otherwise, they should Defect. 

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock} \geq 50\% \text{of capacity, else Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_207 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round (t=1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Start by promoting sustainability and encouraging others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t>1):**
   - Calculate the cooperation rate as `(number of players who chose C in the previous round) / n`.
   - Check if the current stock is above 75% of capacity (`0.75 * capacity`).

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - If **stock > 0.75 * capacity**:
     - If **cooperation_rate >= 60% (0.6)**, Cooperate (C).
     - Else, Defect (D).
       - Rationale: Maintain sustainability when enough players are cooperating. Switch to defecting if cooperation drops significantly.
   - If **stock <= 0.75 * capacity**:
     - Defect (D)
       - Rationale: Prevent further depletion and potential collapse of the resource.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round (t=r):**
     - Since there are no future rounds, players might defect to maximize immediate payoff. However, following the strategy, if the stock is above 75% and cooperation rate is high, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.
   - **Stock Depletion (stock=0):**
     - Once stock hits zero, it cannot recover, so all subsequent rounds will likely result in Defection.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, n, cooperation_rate):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
            if cooperation_rate >= 0.6:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

**Rationale:**

- This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by Cooperating when the resource is healthy and enough others are doing so, thereby encouraging a cooperative equilibrium.
- It adapts to changes in player behavior, switching to Defecting if too many players exploit the resource, preventing further depletion and potential collapse.
- The 75% stock threshold ensures that the resource remains sustainable while allowing room for natural growth. The cooperation rate threshold (60%) acts as a safeguard against exploitation by ensuring that Cooperating is only done when a significant majority does so.

This approach is robust to various opponent behaviors, promoting collective sustainability and adapting to shifts in player strategies over time.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_208 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that encourages cooperation while deterring defection. Here's the organized solution:

### Strategy Overview

The strategy is designed to promote sustainable use of the common pool resource through initial cooperation, adaptability based on others' actions, and careful consideration of the stock level.

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Begin with trust-building by cooperating, allowing the stock to grow and encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Middle Rounds (from Round 2 to Round r-1):**
   - **Monitor Previous Round's Cooperation:**
     - Count the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Check Stock Health:**
     - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity, it is considered healthy.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - **Cooperate** if both conditions are met:
       - The number of cooperators in the previous round is at least half of the players (n/2).
       - The current stock level is above 80% of capacity.
     - **Defect** otherwise to punish defection and encourage future cooperation.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Ensure sustainable use in the final round, maximizing collective payoff despite no future rounds.

### Pseudocode

```pseudocode
function decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number < r-1:
        prev_cooperators = count(history[round_number - 2])
        if prev_cooperators >= n/2 and stock_level >= 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # last round
        return 'C'
```

### Handling Edge Cases

- **First Round:** Unconditional cooperation to set a positive precedent.
- **Middle Rounds:** Adaptive behavior based on previous cooperation and stock health, ensuring sustainability and deterring defection.
- **Last Round:** Cooperation to maximize collective payoff, despite the temptation to defect.

### Alignment with Collective Mindset

This strategy prioritizes long-term sustainability over short-term gains. By rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, it encourages a collectively beneficial outcome, ensuring the resource remains available for all players throughout the game.

By following these rules, the strategy aims to maintain a healthy stock level, promote cooperation among players, and adapt dynamically to different behaviors and stock conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_209 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate in the first round when the stock is at maximum capacity. This helps sustain the resource and promotes cooperation among players.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **Cooperate Conditionally:** If the current stock exceeds 50% of the capacity and most players cooperated in the previous round, continue to Cooperate. This maintains sustainable consumption levels.
   b. **Defect Strategically:** If the stock drops below 50% or if a significant number of players Defected in prior rounds, switch to Defecting. This maximizes immediate gains while preventing further resource depletion.

3. **Adaptation and Monitoring:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock's health and other players' actions. Adjust cooperation levels based on these observations to balance individual gain with collective sustainability.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds, consider defecting more frequently to exploit remaining resources, as there is less future impact from such actions.

5. **Cool-Down Period:**
   - After a period of Defection, switch back to Cooperating if the stock recovers above the 50% threshold. This prevents endless cycles of defection and promotes resource sustainability.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on the common pool's health and opponents' behaviors, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_210 = '''
To address the problem of balancing individual gain against collective resource sustainability in a repeated social dilemma scenario, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both current resource levels and recent cooperation rates. The strategy aims to maintain cooperation when beneficial while defending against exploitation.

### Approach
The strategy is designed to:
1. **Cooperate Initially**: Start by Cooperating in the first round when the resource is abundant.
2. **Defect in the Last Round**: Since there are no future rounds, defecting maximizes immediate gain without worrying about long-term consequences.
3. **Adaptive Cooperation**:
   - Monitor recent cooperation rates from previous rounds to gauge collective behavior.
   - Adjust the required cooperation threshold based on the current stock level relative to capacity:
     - **High Stock (Above 80%)**: Lower threshold for Cooperating, allowing more leniency towards occasional defection.
     - **Moderate Stock (50-80%)**: Medium threshold, encouraging higher cooperation to prevent further depletion.
     - **Low Stock (Below 50%)**: Higher threshold, enforcing stricter cooperation to allow resource recovery.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    if round_number == r:  # Assuming 'r' is the total number of rounds
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate from last k rounds (e.g., 3)
    k = min(3, len(history))
    recent_coop_rate = sum(1 for action in history[-k:] if action == 'C') / k
    
    # Determine thresholds based on stock level
    if stock_level > capacity * 0.8:
        coop_threshold = 0.6
    elif stock_level > capacity * 0.5:
        coop_threshold = 0.7
    else:
        coop_threshold = 0.8
    
    if recent_coop_rate >= coop_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins by Cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and sustainability.
- **Final Round Defection**: Recognizing no future rounds, defecting optimizes immediate gain without risking long-term resource damage.
- **Adaptive Thresholds**:
  - When the stock is high (above 80% capacity), the strategy requires less cooperation from others to Cooperate, allowing some flexibility.
  - As the stock decreases, stricter requirements for cooperation are imposed to encourage collective efforts in preserving the resource.
  - This adaptability ensures that the strategy responds dynamically to both the state of the resource and the behavior patterns of other players.

By integrating these elements, the proposed approach effectively balances individual gain with the sustainability of shared resources, fostering cooperation when beneficial while protecting against exploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_211 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by considering both the current stock level and the cooperation rate of other players.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Round Strategy:** Begin with Cooperating to establish a baseline of cooperation and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Evaluate Stock Health:** In each subsequent round, assess whether the current stock (S_t) is above 60% of capacity. This threshold ensures that there's enough resource left for sustainable growth in future rounds.

3. **Assess Cooperation History:** Check the cooperation rate from the previous round. If at least 70% of players Cooperated, it indicates a cooperative environment conducive to continued Cooperation.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - If both conditions are met (S_t > 60% capacity and ≥70% Cooperated last round), continue to Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, switch to Defecting to either punish defectors or maximize immediate payoff when the resource is low.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment:** Maintain adaptability by periodically reviewing thresholds based on observed trends in stock levels and cooperation rates.

**Final Answer:**

The proposed strategy is for each player to Cooperate if both the current stock exceeds 60% of capacity and at least 70% of players Cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, Defect. This approach balances immediate gains with sustainability and encourages a cooperative environment.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if S > 60\% capacity and ≥70\% cooperated last round; else Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_212 = '''
To address the challenge of sustainably managing a shared resource while competing with other agents, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on observed changes in the resource's health. Here is the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating (C) in the first round to establish trust and observe others' behavior without impacting the resource negatively.

2. **Monitor Resource Health**: After each subsequent round, calculate whether the total consumption led to an increase, decrease, or stability in the resource stock. This is done by computing:
   - `total_consumption_prev`: Sum of all players' consumption from the previous round.
   - `S_remaining_prev = S_prev - total_consumption_prev`
   - `growth_prev = 2 * S_remaining_prev * (1 - S_remaining_prev / capacity)`
   - `new_stock_prev = min(S_remaining_prev + growth_prev, capacity)`

3. **Adaptive Defection Threshold**:
   - If the resource stock decreased (`new_stock_prev < S_prev`) but remains above a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to defecting (D) in the next round to signal against overuse.
   - If the resource is critically low (`new_stock_prev <= 0.25 * capacity`), continue cooperating (C) to attempt rebuilding the resource.

4. **Maintain Sustainability**: Cooperate (C) if the resource stock remains stable or increases, ensuring continued sustainability and encouraging others to do the same.

**Final Strategy:**

- Start with cooperation.
- Defect only when the previous round's overuse caused a significant decrease in the resource but hasn't critically depleted it.
- Cooperate when the resource is stable, increasing, or critically low to foster recovery.

This approach ensures that we adaptively manage our actions based on the resource's state, promoting sustainable use while responding appropriately to others' behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_213 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Moves):**
   - Begin with cooperation in the initial 2-3 rounds to establish a sustainable resource level and encourage others to cooperate.

2. **Monitoring Opponents:**
   - Track the proportion of defection in recent rounds (last 5 rounds) using a weighted average where more recent data has higher weight.

3. **Decision Rules Based on Defection Rate:**
   - If the defection rate is below a threshold (e.g., 30%), continue to cooperate.
   - If the defection rate exceeds this threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains and signal others about overexploitation.

4. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - Cooperate if stock > 80% of capacity, as it indicates a healthy resource level.
   - Defect if stock < 60%, to exploit remaining resources before potential depletion.
   - Between 60%-80%, adapt based on recent defection rates.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to build trust and maintain stock levels.
   - **Last Known Round:** Defect to maximize payoff, anticipating others might also defect.
   - **Unknown Last Round:** Continue with the adaptive strategy focusing on sustainability.

6. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   - Promote long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation when sustainable and defecting only when necessary to prevent resource collapse.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history_defection_rate):
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'
    else:
        recent_defection = calculate_recent_defection(history)
        if recent_defection < DEFECT_THRESHOLD and stock_level > STOCK_HIGH:
            return 'C'
        elif stock_level < STOCK_LOW:
            return 'D'
        else:
            if history_defection_rate > ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD:

def calculate_recent_defection(history, weight=0.7):
    # Apply weights to recent rounds for a more responsive strategy
    weighted_history = [ (1 - weight)**i * h for i, h in enumerate(reversed(history))]

# Thresholds and constants
DEFECT_THRESHOLD = 0.3  # 30% defection rate triggers switch to D
STOCK_HIGH = 0.8        # Cooperate if stock is above 80% of capacity
STOCK_LOW = 0.6         # Defect if stock is below 60%

    history.append(action == 'D')

**Summary:**
This strategy balances cooperation for sustainability with adaptive defection based on observed behavior and resource levels. It aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining collective resource health.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_214 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to promote sustainable cooperation while being adaptive to various player behaviors and resource states. Here's a structured overview:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with Cooperate in the first two rounds to build a baseline of sustainability and prevent immediate depletion.

2. **Stock Monitoring**:
   - Track the stock level relative to capacity.
   - Classify the stock as "healthy" (above 50% capacity), "stressed" (below 30%), or neutral otherwise.
   - Assess recent trends in stock growth/shrinkage to gauge sustainability of current consumption levels.

3. **Opponent Behavior Tracking**:
   - Maintain a history of each opponent's actions, calculating their cooperation rate (Cs / total rounds observed).
   - Use these rates to assess overall cooperation trends among opponents.

4. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate**: If the stock is healthy and most opponents have high cooperation rates (>70%), continue Cooperating.
   - **Defect**: If the stock is stressed or a significant number of opponents are Defecting, switch to Defect as punishment until cooperation improves.

5. **Adaptive Punishment**:
   - Upon detecting Defectors, defect against them for several rounds to incentivize future cooperation.

6. **Handling Final Rounds**:
   - In the last 10% of total rounds, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff by increasing defection, as there's no future impact.

### Rationale

- **Encouraging Cooperation**: By starting with Cooperate and rewarding sustainable behavior, the strategy fosters a cooperative environment.
- **Deterrence Through Punishment**: Detecting Defectors and responding with Defect creates an incentive for them to revert to Cooperate, maintaining resource health.
- **Adaptability**: The strategy dynamically adjusts based on stock health and opponent behavior, ensuring robustness against varying conditions.

### Implementation

Players independently apply this strategy, using their observations of the game state and others' actions. It ensures collective behavior emerges from individual decisions, aiming to sustain the common pool resource effectively across all rounds.

```pseudocode
for each round t in 1..r:
    if t == 1 or t == 2:
        action = C
    else:
        # Calculate stock health
        stock_health = current_stock / capacity
        is_stressed = stock_health < 0.3
        is_healthy = stock_health > 0.5

        # Track opponent cooperation rates
        coop_rates = calculate_cooperation_rates(opponent_histories)

        # Determine if most opponents are Cooperating
        avg_coop = average(coop_rates.values())
        high_coop = avg_coop > 0.7

        # Check for Defectors to punish
        recent_defectors = [i for i in players if opponent_histories[i][-punishment_window:].count(D) > punishment_threshold]

        # Decision
        if is_healthy and high_coop:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
        
    record_action(action)
```

description_COLLECTIVE_215 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The collective strategy is designed to maximize payoffs over multiple rounds while ensuring the sustainability of the common pool resource. It adapts based on current conditions and opponents' behavior, balancing immediate gains with long-term benefits.

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - *Reasoning:* Preserves the stock at maximum capacity, allowing sustainable growth for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Level (S):**
     - If S is above a dynamically adjusted threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), cooperate to sustain and grow the resource.
     - If S is below this threshold, consider defecting to maximize immediate payoff as the stock may not recover significantly.

3. **Adaptation Based on Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Track the historical cooperation rate of other players.
     - If most are cooperating, continue cooperation to maintain higher stock levels.
     - If many are defecting, switch to defection to avoid being exploited and reduce long-term losses from resource depletion.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Adjust the threshold based on observed consumption patterns and growth rates. For instance, if the stock has been decreasing despite cooperation, lower the threshold for switching to defection.

5. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - *Reasoning:* No future rounds to penalize defection; maximize immediate payoff without regard to future consequences.

6. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If S approaches zero, defect as there's little left for sustainable growth.
   - If S is near capacity, cooperate to ensure the resource remains at a high, sustainable level.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, cooperation_history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = maximum_sustainable_stock
    threshold = capacity * 0.5  # Initial threshold

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Adjust threshold based on historical data and cooperation rate
        avg_coop_rate = sum(cooperation_history) / len(cooperation_history)
        if stock_level > threshold and avg_coop_rate > 0.6:  # Arbitrary threshold for cooperation rate
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    if round_number == r:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy starts with cooperation to sustain the resource, then adapts based on stock levels and opponents' actions.
- It uses a dynamic threshold and historical cooperation rates to decide between C and D, ensuring sustainability when possible while adapting to exploiters.
- In the last round, it defects to maximize payoff without future repercussions.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, providing a robust solution against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_216 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoffs over multiple rounds by balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative trend to encourage sustainable stock levels and promote growth for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Level (S):** 
     - If S is above a dynamic threshold, cooperate to maintain or enhance the resource.
     - If S falls below this threshold, defect to maximize immediate payoff, especially if others are defecting.
   - **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold decreases over time, encouraging more defection as rounds progress and future consequences diminish.

3. **Late Rounds (Last Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Prioritize immediate gains since future rounds are limited or nonexistent, minimizing the impact of stock depletion.

4. **Adaptation Based on Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Track the number of defections in previous rounds.
   - If a majority defects, increase tendency to defect to prevent payoff loss from cooperation while others exploit the resource.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```
for each round in r:
    if round is among first few:
        play C
    else:
        calculate current stock S
        determine number of players who defected last round (defectors)
        threshold = initial_threshold - (round_progress * adjustment_factor)
        if S > threshold and defectors < majority:
            play C
        else:
            play D
```

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Cooperate to foster a positive environment and encourage growth.
- **Last Rounds:** Defect to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future depletions.

**Conclusion:** This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to stock levels, opponents' actions, and the progression of rounds. It promotes cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection as necessary to optimize payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_217 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start positively to preserve the resource and encourage others to cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Historical Behavior:**
     - Track the number of defects in each round.
     - Determine if more than a threshold percentage (e.g., 30%) of players are defecting.

   - **Assess Stock Level:**
     - If the current stock is above a healthy threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), continue cooperating.
     - If the stock drops below this threshold, consider defecting to prevent immediate loss of resource.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate:** If less than or equal to the defect threshold and stock is above 75%.
   - **Defect:** If more than the defect threshold or stock is below 75%.

4. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Maintain sustainability even in the last round to avoid unnecessary depletion.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    defect_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'D')
    defect_ratio = defect_count / n

    stock_threshold = 0.75 * capacity

    if current_stock >= stock_threshold and defect_ratio <= 0.3:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage
current_round = 2
past_history = [ ['C', 'C', 'D', 'D'], ... ] # Previous rounds' actions
current_stock_value = 90

action = decide_action(current_round, past_history, current_stock_value)
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to others' behaviors and the current state of the resource. It ensures cooperation when beneficial and defects only when necessary to prevent resource depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_218 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment**

The proposed strategy aims to maintain cooperation while addressing potential defection through punishment, ensuring adaptability and robustness across varying opponent behaviors.

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - All players Cooperate (C) to build trust and sustain the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-5% of total rounds):**
   - Each player monitors the actions of all others in the previous `m` rounds (e.g., m=3).
   - If any player Defected (D) within this window, the player defects in the current round.
   - Otherwise, continue Cooperating.

3. **Final 5% Rounds (Last Few Rounds):**
   - Players switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds do not exist. This prevents others from exploiting the remaining resource without consequence.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(history, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players()
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number <= (total_rounds - 0.05 * total_rounds):
        recent_defectors = any(player_defected in history[-m:] for player_defected in history[-m:])
        return 'D' if recent_defectors else 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Threshold for Defection:** The strategy assumes that observing any defection triggers a response. This helps maintain cooperation unless exploitation is detected.
- **Cooldown Period (`m` rounds):** Allows players to reassess after potential isolated defections, preventing indefinite punishment for single actions.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment:** Recognizes the diminishing future impact of resource depletion in later rounds, encouraging higher immediate gains.

This strategy balances sustainability with individual payoff maximization, adapting dynamically based on observed behaviors and game progression.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_219 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a collective strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observable parameters. This approach ensures adaptability to different opponent behaviors while maintaining robustness across various game states.

### Strategy Overview
The strategy is designed to maximize long-term payoffs by encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion. It dynamically adjusts decisions based on the current stock level, historical defection rates, and specific handling of edge cases like the first and last rounds.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Round (Cooperation):**
   - Begin with cooperation in the first round to set a positive precedent and encourage mutual cooperation among players.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Thresholds:** Establish thresholds relative to capacity to guide decisions.
     - High Stock (Above 80% Capacity): Cooperate if the historical defection rate is below a certain threshold, promoting sustainability.
     - Moderate Stock (Between 40% and 80% Capacity): Adjust cooperation based on both stock level and recent defection rates. If defection rates are low, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect to prevent over-depletion.
     - Low Stock (Below 40% Capacity): Increase likelihood of defecting as the resource is more vulnerable to exploitation.

3. **Defection Rate Monitoring:**
   - Use a moving average of past defection rates to smooth out volatility and avoid overreacting to short-term spikes in defection.

4. **Final Round Handling:**
   - In the last round, if the stock is sufficiently high that cooperation won't lead to significant depletion, cooperate. Otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff without causing irreversible resource damage.

### Edge Cases

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to foster a cooperative environment.
- **Last Round:** Decide based on current stock level—cooperate if sustainable, defect otherwise.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Be cautious but not entirely cooperative; allow some defection to prevent further drops while encouraging mutual cooperation in future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, n, r, round_number, history):
    # Initial parameters
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity

        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate moving average of defection rates over recent rounds (e.g., last 3)
    recent_defections = sum(1 for hist in history[-3:] for action in hist.values() if action == 'D') / (len(history[-3:]) * n) if len(history[-3:]) > 0 else 0
    
    # Decision logic
    if current_stock >= high_threshold:
        if recent_defections < 0.4:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D' if random.random() < 0.5 else 'C'
    elif low_threshold < current_stock < high_threshold:
        if recent_defections < 0.3:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        # Low stock, more likely to defect
        if round_number == r:
            # Last round: defect if possible without crashing the system
            total_consumption = n * (current_stock / n)
            new_stock = current_stock - total_consumption + 2*(current_stock - total_consumption)*(1 - (current_stock - total_consumption)/capacity)
            if new_stock < low_threshold:
                return 'C' if random.random() < 0.5 else 'D'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            return 'D' if recent_defections > 0.2 else 'C'

# Example usage
current_stock = 100
capacity = 100
n = 4
r = 10
round_number = 5
history = [previous_round_actions]  # List of dictionaries with player actions

action = decide_action(current_stock, capacity, n, r, round_number, history)
```

### Explanation
The strategy begins with cooperation to encourage a positive cycle. It then dynamically adjusts based on the stock level and historical defection rates using thresholds. By monitoring these factors and adjusting decisions accordingly, the strategy aims to sustain the common pool resource while maximizing individual payoffs over multiple rounds. This approach ensures adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors without relying on coordination mechanisms.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_220 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Threshold**

1. **Initial Play**: Start with cooperation in the first round to foster a cooperative environment and maintain the stock.

2. **Monitoring Mechanism**: Track total consumption per round to assess collective behavior:
   - Calculate total consumption as the sum of all players' actions.
   - Compare this to expected levels if all were cooperating (S/2) or defecting (S).

3. **Adaptive Decision Rules**:
   - Cooperate in rounds where total consumption indicates a cooperative trend (close to S/2).
   - Defect in rounds with significant defection (total consumption close to S), signaling the need for self-protection.

4. **Threshold Adjustment**: Dynamically adjust thresholds based on historical data to respond effectively to changing player behaviors.

5. **Endgame Handling**: In the last few rounds, consider defecting more to maximize immediate payoffs since future consequences are minimal.

6. **Collective Mindset Alignment**: Prioritize cooperation for mutual benefit while safeguarding against resource collapse due to defectors.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```python
def decision(S, history):
    if first_round:
        return C
    
    total_consumption = calculate_total(history)
    n = number_of_players()
    threshold_coop = S / 2
    threshold_defect = S
    
    if total_consumption > (threshold_coop + threshold_defect) / 2:
        return D
    else:
        return C

def endgame_handling(round_number, r):
    if rounds_remaining <= 5:
        return D
    else:
        return decision(S, history)
```

This strategy balances cooperation with adaptability, ensuring sustainable resource management while protecting against exploitation.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The designed strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation when resources are abundant while allowing defection to prevent exploitation.

1. **Initial Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale**: Preserves the resource and sets a cooperative tone for subsequent rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Check**: 
     - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
     - If below this threshold, consider Defecting (D) to exploit higher immediate gains while others may adjust their strategies.

3. **Adaptation Mechanism**:
   - **Monitor Past Actions**: Track cooperation levels from previous rounds.
   - **Switch Strategy**: If more than 50% of players Defected in the last round, switch to a Defective strategy in the next round to prevent exploitation and encourage others to Cooperate.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to foster initial cooperation.
   - **Last Round**: 
     - If stock is sufficient, Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
     - Otherwise, defect if necessary, but aim to Cooperate if possible to leave the resource in a healthier state.

5. **Stock Dynamics Consideration**:
   - Maintain awareness of how each action affects future stock levels through growth functions, aiming to keep the stock within a moderate range for sustainable payoffs.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on the current state and historical actions, promoting collective sustainability while being robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_222 = '''
**Strategic Approach for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establish trust and maximize resource growth by maintaining the stock at its sustainable level.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Observation Period:** Monitor the actions of all players in the previous rounds.
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If all players cooperated in the last two rounds, continue to Cooperate (C) to sustain the resource and maximize collective payoff.
     - If any player defected in the last round, switch to Defect (D) for the next one or two rounds as punishment. This incentivizes cooperation by making defection costly.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Consider defecting (D) due to the limited impact on future payoffs. However, if most players are still cooperating, continue Cooperating to leverage higher immediate payoffs.
   - **Rationale:** Balance between securing immediate gains and maintaining cooperative norms.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate trust-building.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Be cautious about defecting; if others are also defecting, the collective payoff diminishes. Consider continuing cooperation if it leads to higher individual payoffs.

5. **Collective Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness**
   - Players should base their actions on recent history (last 2-3 rounds).
   - If a player defects, others retaliate by defecting for one or two rounds.
   - After retaliation, return to cooperation if all players resume Cooperating, fostering a cycle of trust and cooperation.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
for each round t in {1..r}:
    if t <= 3:
        action = C
    else:
        recent_rounds = history[t-4:t]
        num_defects = count_defects(recent_rounds)
        if num_defects > threshold:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C
```

**Considerations:**
- **Stock Dynamics:** Incorporate current stock levels into decision-making. If the stock is low, Cooperating might still lead to depletion, so players may need to adjust strategies accordingly.
- **Perfect Information:** Utilize full knowledge of past actions and stock levels to inform each round's strategy.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation while deterring defection through adaptive responses.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Triggers**

The strategy balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection when necessary, adapting based on stock levels and others' actions.

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - Cooperate to build the stock and encourage sustainability.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Monitor stock level and other players' cooperation rates.
     - If stock > 60% of capacity and at least half cooperate, continue cooperating.
     - If stock < 60%, assess others' behavior:
       - Defect if others are mostly defecting or it's near the endgame.

3. **Endgame (Last 20%):**
   - Shift towards defection for immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Track cooperation rates with a focus on recent rounds.
   - Adapt thresholds based on stock and remaining rounds.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate of others (excluding self)
    other_players_coop = average Cooperation in previous rounds
    
    # Determine thresholds
    stock_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    rounds_left = total_rounds - round_number + 1
    endgame_trigger = 0.2 * total_rounds
    
    if current_stock > stock_threshold:
        if other_players_coop >= 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Potential defect impact
            potential_defect_consumption = (num_players - 1) * (defection_rate * max_consumption)
            new_stock = current_stock - potential_defect_consumption + growth(current_stock - potential_defect_consumption)
            if new_stock < stock_threshold:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
    else:
        # Low stock; check endgame and others' behavior
        if rounds_left <= endgame_trigger:
            return 'D'

            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

This strategy promotes cooperation when beneficial, adapts to group dynamics, and ensures maximum payoff in the game's final stages.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_224 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate (C). This sets a positive precedent and helps maintain a high stock level for future rounds.

2. **Assess Previous Round(s):**
   - Monitor the percentage of players who Cooperated in recent rounds to determine collective behavior trends.

3. **Decision Rule:**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If more than 60% of players Cooperated in the last few rounds, continue Cooperating.
   - **Defection Adjustment:** If fewer than 60% Cooperated, consider Defecting (D) for a round or two to incentivize others to Cooperate.

4. **Stock Consideration:**
   - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, prioritize Cooperating to allow recovery and prevent depletion.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - **Last Round:** Cooperate to maintain a sustainable resource level, even if it means lower immediate payoffs.
   - **High Stock Levels:** Maintain Cooperation to keep the stock stable.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate more aggressively to rebuild the stock.

6. **Mitigating Risks:**
   - If the stock drops below a safe threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), enforce Cooperation to rebuild resources.
   - Use a flexible cooperation threshold that adjusts based on current stock levels and historical behavior.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history_cooperations, current_stock, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate in recent rounds (e.g., last 3)
    recent_rounds = min(3, len(history_cooperations))
    cooperation_rate = sum(history_cooperations[-recent_rounds:]) / (n * recent_rounds)
    
    # Determine safe stock level
    safe_level = capacity * 0.5
    
    if current_stock < safe_level:
        return 'C'
    
    threshold = 0.6  # 60% cooperation rate required to Cooperate
    
    if cooperation_rate > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy balances the need for immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation and adjusting behavior based on collective actions and resource status.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_225 = '''
**Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase:**
   - For the first 3-5 rounds, always Cooperate (C). This helps establish a baseline of cooperation, allowing the stock to remain sustainable and providing a steady payoff.

2. **Monitoring and Detection Phase:**
   - After the initial phase, monitor the stock level and the behavior of other players.
   - Calculate the Stock Health Index (SHI) as the difference between actual stock levels and expected stock if everyone were Cooperating. A negative SHI indicates excessive consumption by others.
   - Track the Defection Rate (DR), the proportion of times other players defect in recent rounds.

3. **Adaptive Response:**
   - If SHI is significantly negative or DR exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%), increase defection probability. Start defecting more to prevent further stock depletion and protect future payoffs.
   - Use a probabilistic approach where the likelihood of defecting increases with higher DR, ensuring flexibility.

4. **Late Game Adjustment:**
   - In the last 5 rounds, prioritize immediate gains by increasing defection frequency. Since future sustainability is less critical, focus on maximizing payoff in these final rounds.

5. **Return to Cooperation:**
   - If stock health improves and DR decreases, consider returning to cooperation to sustain the resource for any remaining rounds.

6. **Edge Cases and Failsafes:**
   - Implement a failsafe to switch to defecting if the stock drops too low early on.
   - Be prepared to adapt smoothly as conditions change, avoiding rigid strategies that may fail against mixed behaviors.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with immediate payoff optimization, adapting dynamically to other players' actions while ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_226 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable resource level while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with controlled defection based on observed stock levels and historical player behavior. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation to establish a stable stock level and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Stock Threshold Monitoring**:
   - **Low Stock (Cooperate)**: If the current stock is below 60% of capacity (`threshold = capacity * 0.6`), cooperate to aid in regrowth.
   - **Decreasing Trend (Cooperate)**: Monitor recent stock levels; if they show a decreasing trend over the past few rounds, switch to cooperation to prevent further decline.

3. **Defector Monitoring**:
   - Examine the number of defectors in recent rounds (e.g., the last 3 rounds).
   - If more than half (`n / 2`) of the players have been defecting recently, defect to avoid being exploited by others who are not cooperating.

4. **Adjustments Based on Behavior**:
   - Cooperate if the stock is stable and defectors are in the minority.
   - Defect cautiously when others are defecting, but be mindful of the potential for causing resource depletion.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history):
    threshold = capacity * 0.6  # Example threshold value
    k_recent_rounds = 3         # Number of recent rounds to consider
    defector_threshold = n // 2  # Majority threshold for defecting
    
    if current_stock < threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif is_stock_decreasing(history[-k_recent_rounds:]):
        return 'C'
    else:
        recent_defectors = count_defectors_in(history[-k_recent_rounds:])
        if recent_defectors > defector_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts by cooperating to build a stable resource base.
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Cooperates when the stock is low or decreasing, ensuring sustainability.
- **Defector Adjustment**: Defects only when a significant number of players are defecting, preventing exploitation while considering collective impact.

This strategy aims to sustain the resource while protecting against exploitation, promoting a balance between individual gain and communal well-being.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_227 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Tit-for-Tat Mechanism**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start by encouraging others to cooperate, setting a cooperative tone.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-5%):**
   - **Step 1: Assess Previous Round's Cooperation Rate:**
     - Calculate the percentage of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Step 2: Decision Making Based on Cooperation Rate:**
     - If more than 70% of players Cooperated last round, continue to Cooperate this round. This promotes sustainability and maintains resource levels for future rounds.
     - If less than or equal to 30% of players Cooperated, switch to Defecting this round as a form of retaliation to signal against exploitation.
   - **Step 3: Moderate Response (Optional):**
     - For cooperation rates between 31-70%, consider a mixed strategy where you cooperate with a decreasing probability based on the drop in cooperation. This can help incentivize others to maintain cooperative behavior without fully defecting.

3. **Endgame Handling (Last 5% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** With limited future rounds left, there's less incentive to sustain the resource, so defecting maximizes immediate payoffs.

4. **Forgiveness Mechanism (Optional):**
   - After consecutive rounds of low cooperation, consider reverting to Cooperate in one round to attempt re-establishing a cooperative environment.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate from previous round
    last_coop = sum(history[round_number-2])
    coop_rate = last_coop / n
    
    # Near endgame
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds * 0.05):
        return 'D'
    
    # Decide based on cooperation rate
    if coop_rate > 0.7:
        return 'C'
    elif coop_rate < 0.3:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Mixed strategy: probabilistic cooperation
        prob_coop = max(0, 1 - (1 - coop_rate) * 2)
        if random.random() < prob_coop:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage:
current_round = 5
total_rounds = 20
history = [[], [4]]  # Assuming history[round] gives count of Cooperators
action = decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, history)
```

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on historical behavior, promoting collective sustainability while deterring exploitation. It ensures long-term resource management by encouraging others to cooperate through positive reinforcement and mild retaliation when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_228 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The proposed strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively responding to others' actions and current resource levels. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate in the first three rounds to encourage a cooperative environment.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Level Check:** If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, always Cooperate to aid regrowth.
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** When the stock is above 50%, evaluate cooperation based on previous rounds:
     - If more than 60% of players Cooperated in the last round, Cooperate this round.
     - Otherwise, Defect.

3. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - The strategy adapts to others' behavior while ensuring resource sustainability when levels are low.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock_history, actions_history):
    n = number_of_players()
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate
    if len(actions_history) < 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if stock is low
    if current_stock <= capacity * 0.5:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation proportion in last round
    last_round_actions = actions_history[-1]
    cooperator_count = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    coopperation_proportion = cooperator_count / n
    
    # Decide based on cooperation threshold
    if coopperation_proportion >= 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts by Cooperating to foster a cooperative atmosphere, which is crucial for maintaining resource levels.
- **Stock Threshold:** When the stock is low (below 50%), Cooperating helps in regenerating the resource, ensuring future sustainability.
- **Tit-for-Tat Adaptation:** By Cooperating if others did so in the majority and Defecting otherwise, the strategy encourages mutual cooperation while deterring excessive defection.

This approach aims to maximize personal payoff while contributing to collective resource management.

description_COLLECTIVE_229 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on past behavior and current resource levels. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - *Reasoning:* Sets a cooperative tone, promoting stability and encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Past Behavior:**
     - Track the number of players who cooperated in the previous k rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds).
   - **Determine Cooperation Rate:**
     - Calculate the cooperation rate as the percentage of players who cooperated.
   - **Decision Making:**
     - If the cooperation rate is above a threshold (e.g., 50%), continue to Cooperate.
     - If below the threshold, Defect to punish defectors and encourage future cooperation.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Consider defecting if possible.
     - *Reasoning:* Since there are no future rounds, defecting may yield higher immediate payoffs without long-term consequences on resource depletion.

4. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - **When Stock is Low (<80% of capacity):**
     - Prioritize Cooperating to facilitate stock regeneration and avoid further depletion.
   - **When Stock is High (≥80% of capacity):**
     - Base decisions more on past behavior, as the resource can sustain moderate consumption.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number < total_rounds:
        # Calculate cooperation rate in recent rounds
        recent_coop = sum(1 for h in history[-k:] if h.count('C') >= n/2)
        coop_rate = recent_coop / k
        if current_stock < 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif coop_rate > threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Last round
        return 'D'

# Example parameters
k = 3  # Look back at last 3 rounds
threshold = 0.5  # Cooperate if >=50% of recent actions were cooperative
```

### Summary

This strategy starts with cooperation to foster a stable environment, adapts based on the observed behavior of others, and considers the current state of the resource to maintain sustainability. By dynamically adjusting actions, it aims to maximize long-term payoffs while encouraging collective responsibility towards the common pool.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to promote sustainability and fairness by balancing immediate payoffs with long-term resource preservation. It adapts based on the current stock level and its trends, without relying on others' strategies.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**

- **Initial Rounds (First 2 rounds):**  
  Always Cooperate to establish a baseline and observe system dynamics.

- **Middle Rounds:**  
  - Calculate the difference in stock from the previous round (ΔS = current_stock - last_round_stock).
  - If ΔS is positive or stable:  
    - Cooperate if the current stock is above 60% of capacity.
    - Defect moderately (with a probability decreasing as stock approaches 80%) if above 70% to test impact without risking depletion.
  - If ΔS is negative (stock decreased):  
    - Switch to full Cooperation to allow regrowth.

- **Last Few Rounds:**  
  Cooperate aggressively to preserve remaining stock, ensuring some payoff in final rounds.

---

### **2. Threshold Adjustments**

- Use dynamic thresholds adjusting based on past trends:
  - If over recent rounds, stock consistently stays below 70%, lower threshold to 60% for more conservative behavior.
  - Adjust defect probability inversely with stock level above 70%.

---

### **3. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Cooperate unconditionally.
- **Last Round(s):** Cooperate to maximize collective payoff without future concerns.
- If stock reaches zero (unlikely given initial conditions), all players cooperate in subsequent rounds to allow regrowth.

---

### **4. Pseudocode for Decision-Making**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, last_round_stock):
    if round_number <= 2:
        return 'C'
    else:
        delta_s = current_stock - last_round_stock
        threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
        threshold_low = 0.6 * capacity
        
        # Calculate dynamic thresholds based on history
        recent_trend = calculate_recent_trend()
        if recent_trend == 'decreasing':
            threshold_low *= 0.9
            
        if delta_s >= 0:
            if current_stock > threshold_high:
                return 'D'  # Defect with lower probability as stock increases beyond high threshold
            elif current_stock > threshold_low:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'C'  # Cooperate to allow regrowth
        else:  # Stock decreased last round
            return 'C'
```

---

### **5. Summary of Strategy**

This strategy adapts dynamically, starting with cooperation to observe system behavior, then adjusting based on stock trends and thresholds to balance payoffs and sustainability. It's robust against various opponent behaviors by focusing on observable state changes rather than specific strategies.

**Final Answer:**  
The adaptive strategy begins with cooperation in the first two rounds, then adjusts actions based on stock levels and trends, maintaining a conservative approach when the stock is low and allowing moderate defection when the stock is high. It ensures long-term sustainability while balancing immediate gains.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_231 = '''
To address the problem of resource management among players, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation for sustainability with defection to maximize individual payoffs, particularly in the final round. The solution is structured as follows:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Steady State Stock Level:**
   - The logistic growth model indicates that the maximum sustainable stock level (where growth equals consumption) occurs at 75% of the initial capacity (0.75 * capacity). This is calculated by setting the growth rate equal to total consumption and solving for S.

2. **Determine the Cooperation Threshold:**
   - Players will Cooperate if the current stock level (S) exceeds this sustainable threshold (0.75 * capacity). This ensures that resource depletion does not occur beyond recovery, maintaining a healthy stock for future rounds.

3. **Defection Strategy:**
   - When the stock level drops to or below 75% of capacity, players will Defect. This allows them to maximize their individual payoffs in the short term while acknowledging that the resource is already being depleted.

4. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - In the last round, regardless of the current stock level, all players will Defect. This decision prioritizes maximizing immediate gains since there are no future rounds affected by depletion.

**Decision Rule Implementation:**

- For each round except the last:
  - If S > 0.75 * capacity → Cooperate (take S/(2n))
  - Else → Defect (take S/n)
  
- In the final round:
  - Regardless of S → Defect (take S/n)

**Edge Cases Addressed:**

- **First Round:** The stock starts at full capacity, which is above the sustainable threshold. Players Cooperate to maintain a healthy resource level.
- **Last Round:** All players defect to maximize their individual payoffs without concern for future rounds.

This strategy ensures a balance between maintaining a sustainable resource and maximizing personal gain, particularly in the final round where future considerations are irrelevant.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_232 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Sustainability Strategy (ASS)

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoffs while ensuring the sustainability of the common pool resource over multiple rounds through adaptive cooperation and defection based on stock dynamics.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C).
     - *Reasoning:* Start with a sustainable approach to maintain the stock for future rounds, encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **If the current stock is increasing or stable compared to the previous round:**
     - Cooperate (C).
       - *Reasoning:* Sustainable consumption indicates that cooperation is effective, so continue promoting collective sustainability.
   - **If the current stock decreases by more than a threshold (e.g., 10% of capacity) compared to the previous round:**
     - Defect (D) in this round and potentially subsequent rounds until:
       - The stock begins to recover or stabilize.
       - *Reasoning:* A significant decrease signals over-exploitation, necessitating short-term defection to signal the need for balance.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Cooperate (C).
     - *Reasoning:* Maintain consistency and avoid a "race to deplete" in the last round, which could set a negative precedent if the game were to continue.

---

### **Handling Edge Cases:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate (C) to encourage sustainable behavior from the start.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Always Cooperate (C) to avoid sudden depletion and maintain trust in collective efforts.

3. **Stock Near Capacity or Zero:**
   - If stock is near capacity, continue Cooperating (C) to prevent over-consumption.
   - If stock is near zero, consider Defecting (D) only if others are also defecting excessively; otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).

---

### **Collective Mindset Alignment:**

- ASS promotes a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.
- By adapting actions based on stock trends, players signal the importance of moderation to others.
- The strategy fosters trust by consistently rewarding cooperation when it leads to sustainable outcomes.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, previous_stocks):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if len(previous_stocks) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Last round: Cooperate
    if current_round == total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate stock change from the last round
    previous_stock = previous_stocks[-1]
    stock_change = (current_stock - previous_stock)
    
    # Threshold for significant decrease (adjust as needed)
    threshold_decrease = 0.1 * capacity
    
    if stock_change > 0 or abs(stock_change) < threshold_decrease:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Note: The above pseudocode is a simplified version; actual implementation would require tracking all previous stocks and considering the broader context.
```

---

### **Summary of Strategy:**

- **Initial and Final Rounds:** Cooperate to set a positive tone and avoid last-round depletion.
- **Middle Rounds:** Adapt based on stock trends, Cooperating when sustainable and Defecting when necessary to signal over-exploitation.
- **Collective Goal:** Promote balance between individual gain and resource sustainability through adaptive behavior.

This strategy is robust because it aligns with the collective interest of maintaining a healthy common pool while allowing for adaptability in response to others' actions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_233 = '''
To address this problem, we need to design a strategy that allows each player to decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the observed state of a shared resource. The goal is to maintain cooperation among players to prevent rapid depletion of the resource while allowing for adaptation if others start defecting.

### Approach
The approach involves using a threshold-based strategy where each player observes the current stock level of the resource. If the stock level is above or equal to a predefined threshold, indicating that other players are cooperating sufficiently, the player chooses to cooperate. If the stock level falls below this threshold, it suggests that some players are defecting, leading the player to switch to defection.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_cooperate(stock_level, capacity):
    # Define the threshold as 90% of capacity
    threshold = 0.9 * capacity
    return stock_level >= threshold

# Example usage:
capacity = 100  # Total resource capacity
current_stock = 85  # Current observed stock level

if decide_cooperate(current_stock, capacity):
    print("Cooperate")
else:
    print("Defect")
```

### Explanation
- **Threshold Definition**: The threshold is set to 90% of the total resource capacity. This buffer allows for minor fluctuations in the stock level without immediately triggering a switch to defection.
- **Decision Logic**: Each player checks if the current stock level is above or equal to the defined threshold. If it is, they cooperate by using the resource sustainably. If not, they defect to maximize their immediate gain before the resource is depleted.

This strategy balances between maintaining cooperation when possible and adapting to situations where others are defecting, thereby preventing rapid resource depletion while allowing for individual optimization based on observed conditions.

description_COLLECTIVE_234 = '''
To approach this problem optimally, one should balance maintaining the resource for sustainable payoffs with maximizing immediate gains. Here's a step-by-step explanation and answer:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in every round except the last to maintain the resource level, ensuring maximum growth and sustained payoffs.

2. **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, defect to maximize your payoff since there are no future consequences of depleting the resource.

3. **Monitor Resource Levels**: Keep track of the resource stock (S). If S drops significantly below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), consider defecting earlier to prevent further depletion and secure higher immediate payoffs before potential collapse.

**Answer**: The optimal strategy is to cooperate in all rounds except the last, where you should defect. Additionally, monitor the resource level; if it drops below a critical threshold, defect early to maximize your payoff while preventing complete depletion. This approach balances sustaining the resource with securing maximum gains when possible.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold Adjustments**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Rounds (First 10%):** Cooperate unconditionally to build a high stock level, encouraging others to follow suit.
   - **Middle Rounds:** Use dynamic thresholds based on current stock and past cooperation:
     - **Cooperate** if the stock is above 75% of capacity.
     - **Adjust Cooperation/Defection** between 25%-75% based on recent trends (e.g., decreasing stock leads to reduced cooperation).
     - **Defect** if the stock drops below 25% to prevent collapse.
   - **Last 10% Rounds:** Increase defection rate, but cooperate if the stock remains above a certain level.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a high starting point.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Allow more defection as future impact diminishes, while still cooperating if beneficial.

3. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   - Prioritizes long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation when stock is healthy.
   - Adapts dynamically to changing conditions and collective behavior, balancing immediate gains with future viability.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    # Initial threshold setup
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity

    if round_number <= total_rounds / 10:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number >= (total_rounds - total_rounds / 10):
        # Final rounds: increase defection
        if stock_level > high_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        # Middle rounds: adjust based on stock and history
        if stock_level > high_threshold:
            recent_coop = calculate_recent_cooperation(history)
            if recent_coop > 0.7:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        elif low_threshold < stock_level <= high_threshold:
            trend = calculate_stock_trend(history)
            if trend == 'increasing':
                return 'C'
            elif trend == 'decreasing' and stock_level > (low_threshold + 10):
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        else:
            # Stock below low threshold
            return 'D'

def calculate_recent_cooperation(history):
    # Analyze recent rounds for cooperation rate among others
    pass

def calculate_stock_trend(history):
    # Determine if stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable
    pass
```

This strategy dynamically adjusts based on the current state and past behavior, promoting collective sustainability while being resilient to various opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_236 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation based on current stock levels and historical player behavior. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Begin with maximum cooperation by setting the initial threshold (Thresh) equal to the capacity.
   - Use a dynamic threshold that adapts to other players' actions over time.

2. **Decision Making Each Round:**
   - Check the current stock level (S).
   - Cooperate if S is above Thresh; defect otherwise.

3. **Updating Threshold:**
   - Track historical cooperation rates of other players using a moving average (e.g., 10% of past rounds or a recent window).
   - Adjust Thresh based on others' behavior:
     - Higher Thresh if others cooperate more.
     - Lower Thresh if others defect more.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate fully as there's no prior history.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., 5% of total rounds):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future sustainability.

### Pseudocode:
```python
Initialize Thresh = capacity
history = []
coop_rate = 0.5  # Initial estimate

for each round t in r:
    S = current_stock()
    
    if len(history) == 0:
        action = C
    else:
        average_coop = sum([h['coop'] for h in history]) / len(history)
        coop_rate = 0.1 * average_coop + 0.9 * coop_rate  # Exponential moving average
    
    if t >= r - (r // 20):  # Last few rounds
        action = D
    else:
        Thresh = capacity * max(0.5, (coop_rate))  # Adjust based on others' cooperation
        if S > Thresh:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    
    play(action)
    record_opponent_actions()
    
Update history with current actions and coop_rate.
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Adaptability:** The strategy adapts to shifts in opponents' behavior, allowing it to cooperate when others do and defect as necessary.
- **Sustainability vs. Exploitation:** Balances immediate gains from defection with the need to conserve resources for future rounds.
- **Robustness:** Functions without relying on coordination or prior knowledge of opponent strategies.

This approach ensures a responsive and adaptive strategy, capable of thriving in diverse competitive environments while maintaining a focus on long-term sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_237 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation and defection in order to maintain a sustainable resource level while maximizing individual gains, we propose an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts based on the current state of the resource. This strategy aims to prevent over-depletion by encouraging cooperation when the resource is healthy and allowing defection when necessary.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set a dynamic threshold `T`, initially at 75% of the total capacity (e.g., T = 0.75 * C).
   - Begin by Cooperating in the first few rounds to build up the resource level.

2. **Resource Monitoring:**
   - After each round, calculate the remaining resource (`S_remaining`) after consumption.
   - Track recent trends of `S_remaining` over a defined number of past rounds (e.g., 5-10 rounds) to determine if the resource is increasing, decreasing, or stable.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - If the trend indicates that `S_remaining` has been increasing over the past rounds, raise the threshold `T` towards a higher value (e.g., 90% of capacity).
   - Conversely, if `S_remaining` is decreasing, lower the threshold `T` to encourage more cooperation and prevent further decline.

4. **Cooperation vs. Defection Decision:**
   - For each subsequent round:
     - If `S_remaining` >= `T` and the trend shows stability or an increase, decide to Cooperate.
     - If `S_remaining` < `T` or there is a decreasing trend, switch to Defecting to capture immediate gains while allowing others' cooperation to rebuild the resource.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds (or another predefined endgame phase), switch to Defecting to maximize individual gains since there's no future benefit in maintaining a high resource level.

6. **Implementation and Adaptation:**
   - Continuously monitor `S_remaining` and adjust the strategy based on observed trends.
   - Fine-tune the threshold adjustments (e.g., how much to increase or decrease `T`) based on simulation results and performance metrics.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy involves dynamically adjusting between cooperation and defection based on the current state of the resource. Initially, cooperate to build up the resource. Monitor the remaining stock after each round, and if it falls below a certain threshold or shows a decreasing trend, switch to defecting. In the final stages, defect to maximize gains.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Adaptively Cooperate when above Threshold T, else Defect}}

description_COLLECTIVE_238 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that encourages cooperation while deterring defection through strategic mechanisms. Here's a structured outline of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation and deterring defection. It uses a dynamic threshold system based on past actions and current stock levels.

### Key Components:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Begin with Cooperate (C) in the first round to foster a cooperative environment and set a positive tone for future interactions.

2. **Monitoring and Scoring System:**
   - Track each player's actions over time.
   - Calculate a cooperation score based on the number of players who cooperated, weighted by their impact on the stock.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds:**
   - Establish thresholds for acceptable levels of defection. If the observed defection exceeds these thresholds, switch to Defect (D) in subsequent rounds as punishment.
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on the current stock level and remaining rounds to balance immediate needs with future sustainability.

4. **Stock Level Considerations:**
   - When the stock is high, maintain a cooperative stance to preserve resources for future rounds.
   - As the stock depletes, adjust strategies to either continue cooperation (to encourage replenishment) or defect (to prevent further loss).

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Start with C to set a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Round:** Consider continuing cooperation if it maintains sustainability; otherwise, allow for defection as there's no future punishment.

6. **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
   - Be cautious of sudden changes in behavior but remain vigilant against persistent defection. Forgiveness is extended to occasional defectors but not to repeat offenders.

### Pseudocode Outline:
```python
def strategy(player_index, history, stock_level, capacity, current_round, total_rounds):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    cooperation_score = calculate_cooperation_score(history)
    stock_threshold = determine_stock_threshold(stock_level, capacity, current_round, total_rounds)
    
    if cooperation_score < stock_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

def calculate_cooperation_score(history):
    # Calculate based on past actions and their impact
    pass

def determine_stock_threshold(stock_level, capacity, current_round, total_rounds):
    # Dynamic threshold calculation considering stock level and rounds remaining
    pass
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy is designed to be adaptive, encouraging cooperation while deterring defection through strategic punishment. It dynamically adjusts based on past actions and current stock levels, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability. By incorporating mechanisms for monitoring, scoring, and dynamic thresholds, the strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment while safeguarding against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_239 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a strategy that promotes cooperation while maintaining adaptability to different scenarios. The strategy is designed to maximize long-term payoffs by balancing immediate gains with resource sustainability.

### Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative Defection (ACD)

**Objective**: Maximize cumulative payoff over multiple rounds by promoting cooperation when sustainable and defecting when necessary, based on stock levels and historical player behavior.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to encourage a stable resource level and build trust among players.

2. **Stock Threshold Check**: Each round, evaluate the current stock against predefined thresholds:
   - **High Stock (Above 75% of capacity)**: Continue Cooperating as the resource is sustainable.
   - **Moderate Stock (Between 25% and 75% of capacity)**: Cooperate if most players did so in the previous round; otherwise, Defect to prevent exploitation.
   - **Low Stock (Below 25% of capacity)**: Switch to Defecting to minimize losses as recovery is unlikely.

3. **Recent Player Behavior**: Track the proportion of Cooperators from recent rounds:
   - If more than 70% of players Cooperated in the last round, continue Cooperating.
   - Otherwise, switch to Defecting to avoid being exploited by Defectors.

4. **Round Progression Adjustment**:
   - In the first 25% of rounds, prioritize Cooperation to build a sustainable resource base.
   - In the middle 50%, adapt based on stock levels and player behavior.
   - In the final 25% of rounds, be more lenient towards Defecting since future payoffs are limited.

### Edge Cases

- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Few Rounds (Final 10%)**: Players may defect more as future payoffs diminish. The strategy allows for more defection here to capitalize on remaining resources.
- **Stock at Capacity or Near Zero**:
   - At capacity, Cooperate to maintain high growth potential.
   - Near zero, Defect since little resource remains for sustainable use.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players()
    cooperation_threshold = 0.7  # 70% of players Cooperated in the last round
    stock_high = capacity * 0.75
    stock_low = capacity * 0.25
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    recent_rounds = history[-3:]  # Look at the past 3 rounds
    num_coop = sum(1 for r in recent_rounds for action in r.values() if action == 'C')
    coop_proportion = num_coop / (n * len(recent_rounds))
    
    if stock > stock_high:
        return 'C'
    elif stock_low <= stock <= stock_high:
        if coop_proportion >= cooperation_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # stock < stock_low
        return 'D'
    
    # Additional adjustment for final rounds
    if round_number > total_rounds * 0.9:
        return 'D'
```

### Summary

The Adaptive Cooperative Defection strategy begins with Cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base, then adapts based on current stock levels and recent player behavior. It promotes long-term cooperation by encouraging mutual benefits while defending against exploitation. The strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors and ensures adaptability across different game stages.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_240 = '''
The optimal collective strategy balances cooperation with defecting based on current resource levels and recent player behavior:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set high threshold (H) at 80% of capacity and low threshold (L) at 40%.
   - Monitor the last 5 rounds for defector proportion.

2. **Decision Rules Each Round:**
   - If stock ≥ H and recent defectors < 30%, Cooperate.
   - If stock ≤ L or recent defectors > 30%, Defect.
   - Else, follow majority cooperation in recent rounds.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Adjust thresholds based on stock trend to encourage sustainability.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is for each player to:

- Cooperate when the current stock exceeds 80% of capacity and less than 30% of recent actions were defects.
- Defect if the stock drops below 40%, or if more than 30% of recent actions were defects.
- If conditions are intermediate, follow the majority cooperation observed in recent rounds.

This strategy balances resource sustainability with individual payoff incentives while adapting to changing conditions.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when stock >80% and <30% recent defects; else Defect}}

To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a scenario where actions affect future states, I propose an adaptive strategy that switches between cooperation and defection based on current conditions and past trends. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate to establish a positive baseline and encourage others to do likewise.

2. **Adaptive Behavior in Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **High Stock Level (S > 80% capacity):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since the stock can sustain higher consumption.
   - **Moderate Stock Level (40% < S ≤ 80%):**
     - Assess the trend of stock levels over the past k rounds (e.g., last 3).
     - If the average change in stock (delta_S) is negative, Cooperate to help rebuild the stock.
     - If delta_S is positive or stable, Defect to exploit the current resource abundance.
   - **Low Stock Level (S ≤ 40%):** Always Cooperate to prevent further depletion and facilitate recovery.

3. **Final Round Exploitation:**
   - In the last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start by Cooperating in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.

2. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Maintain a buffer of past stock levels (e.g., last 3 rounds).
   - Calculate the average delta_S over this period to determine if the stock is increasing, stable, or decreasing.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - Use thresholds and trend analysis to decide between Cooperating and Defecting:
     - High S allows for defecting without risking collapse.
     - Moderate S requires balancing based on recent trends.
     - Low S necessitates cooperation to rebuild.

4. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - Switch to defecting in the final round to capitalize on remaining resources without worrying about future impacts.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Round 1:** Cooperate → Establishes a cooperative baseline.
- **Round 2:** If stock is high (e.g., 90%), Defect for higher payoff.
- **Round 3:** If stock drops moderately (e.g., to 70%) but trend shows decline, switch to Cooperating.
- **Round r-1:** Continue adjusting based on current S and trends.
- **Round r:** Defect to maximize final payoff.

This strategy dynamically adapts to changing conditions, ensuring both immediate gains and long-term sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_242 = '''
To address the problem of determining when to cooperate or defect in a repeated game involving a shared resource, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy for Cooperation and Defection

1. **Initial Threshold Setup**:
   - Begin with a high threshold \( T \) close to the initial capacity of the resource. For example, set \( T = 0.9 \times \text{capacity} \).

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**:
   - Gradually decrease \( T \) as the number of remaining rounds decreases. This adjustment can be linear or exponential, ensuring that the threshold becomes more lenient towards defection in later rounds.

3. **Cooperation Decision**:
   - In each round, if the current stock \( S_t \) is greater than or equal to \( T \), cooperate by consuming your fair share of the resource.
   - If \( S_t < T \), defect by consuming as much as possible to maximize immediate gain.

4. **Behavioral Adjustment**:
   - Observe the proportion of players who defected in previous rounds. If a significant majority (e.g., more than 50%) defected, consider adjusting your strategy to be more likely to defect even if \( S_t \) is above \( T \). This adjustment helps prevent being exploited by persistent defectors.

### Explanation

- **Sustainability Focus**: By starting with a high threshold, the strategy encourages cooperation when the resource is abundant, promoting sustainability and maintaining higher payoffs over time.
  
- **Adaptability to Defection**: The dynamic adjustment of \( T \) allows the strategy to adapt to changing conditions. As rounds progress, especially nearing the end, the threshold lowers, making defection more appealing if the resource has been depleted significantly by others.

- **Incentive Alignment**: Observing and responding to other players' actions ensures that the strategy doesn't blindly cooperate when others are exploiting the resource. This balance helps prevent being taken advantage of while still fostering cooperation when beneficial.

This approach effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on the current state of the resource and the observed behavior of other players. It aims to maximize individual payoffs while encouraging collective resource management.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the stock is above a decreasing threshold; otherwise, defect.}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_243 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Threshold Strategy**

Our strategy employs an adaptive threshold approach to balance between cooperation and defection dynamically based on the current state of the common pool resource and historical play patterns.

### **1. Decision Rules:**
- **Cooperate (C):** If the current stock level is above the dynamic threshold \( T \), cooperate.
- **Defect (D):** If the current stock level is below or equal to \( T \), defect.

### **2. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
The threshold \( T \) adapts after each round based on the following rules:
- **Increase \( T \):** If in the previous round, there was a significant decrease in the stock (indicating higher consumption due to defection) or if the number of defectors increased.
- **Decrease \( T \):** If the stock increased significantly, indicating that cooperation is sustainable and allowing for a lower threshold.

### **3. Initialization:**
- Start with an initial threshold \( T_0 = \text{capacity} / 2 \). This serves as a midpoint, encouraging moderate cooperation while allowing room for adaptation.

### **4. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate since the stock is at its maximum capacity.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** Adjust \( T \) based on historical consumption and stock growth/shrinkage.
- **Unknown Last Round:** Treat each round as potentially the last, balancing between maximizing immediate payoff and preserving the resource for future rounds.

### **5. Implementation Steps:**
1. **Initialize Parameters:**
   - Set initial threshold \( T = \text{capacity} / 2 \).
   - Track historical stock levels and player actions.

2. **Each Round:**
   a. Observe current stock level \( S \).
   b. Determine action (C or D) based on whether \( S > T \).

3. **Adjust Threshold After Each Round:**
   a. Calculate the change in stock.
   b. If stock decreased significantly, increase \( T \) to encourage more cooperation.
   c. If stock increased, decrease \( T \) slightly to allow for more sustainable harvesting.

4. **Adaptation Smoothing:**
   - Use a smoothing factor to prevent abrupt changes in \( T \), ensuring gradual adjustments based on trends over multiple rounds.

### **6. Pseudocode:**

```python
# Initialize parameters
capacity = game_capacity
T = capacity / 2
history_length = 5  # Number of past rounds considered for adjustment

for each round in r:
    S = current_stock_level()
    
    if S > T:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        action = 'D'
    
    record_action(action)
    
    # After the round, adjust threshold based on previous history
    recent_history = get_last_n_rounds(history_length)
    stock_change = calculate_stock_change(recent_history)
    
    if stock_change < 0:  # Stock decreased
        T += abs(stock_change) * 0.1  # Increase threshold to encourage more cooperation
    elif stock_change > 0 and S > capacity / 2:
        T -= stock_change * 0.05  # Decrease threshold slightly if sustainable
    
    # Ensure T stays within reasonable bounds
    T = max(T, capacity / 4)
    T = min(T, 3 * capacity / 4)
```

### **7. Benefits:**
- **Adaptability:** The strategy dynamically adjusts to different player behaviors and stock conditions.
- **Sustainability:** Encourages cooperation when the resource is sufficient, promoting long-term sustainability.
- **Protection Against Exploitation:** Adjusts by defecting if others exploit the resource excessively, preventing premature depletion.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining collective resource health through adaptive decision-making.

description_COLLECTIVE_244 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to conserve the resource pool, ensuring higher stock levels for subsequent rounds and encouraging potential cooperation from other players.

2. **Adaptive Defection Threshold**: In each subsequent round:
   - Observe the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - If the number of defectors is below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 1/3 of total players), defect to maximize individual payoff while maintaining resource sustainability.
   - If the number of defectors exceeds this threshold, cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow the stock to recover.

3. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last few rounds (specifically the final 20% of rounds):
   - Increase cooperation to preserve the remaining stock, anticipating that other players might defect more as the game concludes.
   - This adjustment aims to mitigate rapid resource exhaustion, ensuring a balanced payoff distribution in the closing rounds.

**Implementation Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock, n_players):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate initially to conserve resources
    
    prev_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'D')
    threshold = n_players / 3  # Example threshold adjustment
    
    if round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 5):  # Last 20% of rounds
        return 'C'  # Cooperate more to prevent stock crash
    
    if prev_defectors < threshold:
        return 'D'  # Defect if few others did, to gain more
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate if many defected to preserve resources
```

This strategy balances individual gains with collective resource management, adapting dynamically to other players' behaviors and adjusting near the game's end to prevent abrupt depletions.

To address the problem of maintaining cooperation while preventing excessive resource depletion in a multi-round game with perfect information, we propose a strategy that balances individual incentives with collective sustainability.

### Approach
The strategy is designed to encourage players to cooperate when it benefits the group and to defect only when necessary. It incorporates feedback from recent gameplay and current stock levels to dynamically adjust decisions. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase**: Players start by cooperating for the first 10% of rounds to build a healthy resource base.
2. **Dynamic Decision Making**: For each subsequent round, players assess the cooperation rate among others in recent rounds and the current stock level. They cooperate if enough others are cooperating and the stock is sufficiently high; otherwise, they defect.
3. **Personal Cooldown Mechanism**: To prevent excessive defection by any single player, individuals track their own recent actions and force cooperation after a certain number of defects.
4. **Final Cooperation Phase**: In the last 10% of rounds, players always cooperate to maximize remaining payoffs.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history_coop, my_defects, current_round, r=100):
    # Parameters
    FIRST_PHASE = int(0.1 * r)
    LAST_PHASE = int(0.9 * r)
    n_recent = 3  # Number of past rounds to consider for cooperation rate
    threshold_coop_rate = 0.6  # Minimum proportion of cooperators needed to cooperate
    cooldown_defects = 2  # Max defects in last 5 rounds before forcing coop
    
    if current_round <= FIRST_PHASE or current_round >= LAST_PHASE:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among all players
    total_players = len(history_coop[0])
    recent_coop = sum([sum(round_coop) for round_coop in history_coop[-n_recent:]])
    avg_coop = recent_coop / (n_recent * total_players)
    
    # Personal cooldown check
    if sum(my_defects[-5:]) >= cooldown_defects:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate thresholds based on current stock
    capacity = 100  # Assuming max capacity is 100 for example
    low_stock_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    medium_low = 0.4 * capacity
    medium_high = 0.6 * capacity

    if current_stock > high_stock_threshold:
        stock_threshold = medium_high
    elif current_stock < low_stock_threshold:
        stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    else:
        stock_threshold = current_stock / 2
    
    # Decision based on cooperation rate and stock level
    if avg_coop > threshold_coop_rate and current_stock > stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Phase**: Ensures the resource starts at a healthy level, encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Dynamic Decision Making**: Uses recent cooperation rates and current stock levels to decide actions. Cooperates if enough players are cooperating and the stock is sufficient; defects otherwise.
- **Personal Cooldown**: Prevents individual players from defecting too much in succession, maintaining overall resource health.
- **Final Phase**: Maximizes payoffs by ensuring cooperation when there's little future impact.

This strategy aims to balance individual gain with collective sustainability, promoting a stable cooperative environment unless conditions justify defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_246 = '''
**Final Answer:**

To design a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that is adaptive and robust, we can outline the following approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy focuses on maintaining sustainability through cooperation while adapting to potential defection. It uses observable state variables (stock level) and historical cooperation rates to decide actions.

---

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **Default Action:** Cooperate (C) in each round.
- **Switching Condition:** Defect (D) if the stock falls below a critical threshold, indicating excessive depletion.

**Pseudocode for Decision Making:**
```python
def decide_action(stock, history_coop_rate, round_number):
    # Parameters
    LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD = 0.3 * capacity
    HIGH_DEFECT_RATE = 0.6
    FINAL_ROUNDS = 5

    # Early rounds: prioritize cooperation for sustainability
    if round_number <= r // 2:
        return C

    # Check stock level and historical defect rate
    if stock < LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD or history_coop_rate < HIGH_DEFECT_RATE:
        return D

    # In the last few rounds, be cautious
    if round_number > r - FINAL_ROUNDS:
        return D if stock < 0.5 * capacity else C

    # Default to cooperation
    return C
```

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to encourage sustainability and set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds):** Switch to D if the stock is below 50% of capacity, preventing others from depleting it further.

---

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

The strategy aligns with a collective mindset by:
- Encouraging cooperation to maintain resource sustainability.
- Adapting to potential defection by monitoring stock levels and cooperation rates.
- Balancing individual payoffs with the need to preserve the common pool for future rounds.

---

### Conclusion:
This strategy promotes long-term sustainability while being adaptive to different opponent behaviors. By focusing on observable indicators, it ensures robustness without relying on coordination mechanisms or specific patterns from other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_247 = '''
The proposed strategy for managing cooperation and defection in the context of maintaining sustainable stock levels is as follows:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and sustainability.

2. **Monitor Consumption**: After each round, calculate the expected consumption under full cooperation (E = previous_stock / 2) and compare it with the actual consumption (A). Track whether A exceeds E over consecutive rounds.

3. **Punishment Phase Trigger**: If there are k consecutive rounds where A > E, switch to defecting for m rounds as a punitive measure against excessive defection. This aims to incentivize others to revert to cooperation.

4. **Recovery Check**: During the punishment phase, monitor if consumption drops below E or if stock levels show signs of recovery. If so after m rounds, reset and return to cooperating.

5. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the final p% of rounds, prioritize cooperation to maintain stock levels despite the nearing end of the game, promoting sustainable practices until the conclusion.

This strategy adapts dynamically, encouraging cooperation when possible and switching to defection as a corrective measure against excessive resource exploitation, thereby balancing sustainability with punitive incentives.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_248 = '''
The strategy outlined below aims to balance between cooperation and defection based on historical actions and the current state of the common pool. It is designed to adapt dynamically, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion or punish defectors.

---

### **Strategic Approach: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment**

#### **Decision Rules**
1. **Initial Rounds (First Round):** Cooperate unconditionally to foster a cooperative environment.
2. **Middle Rounds:** 
   - Monitor the last `m` rounds (e.g., 3) for cooperation rates.
   - If the stock is above a safe threshold (50% of capacity) and cooperation rate in recent rounds exceeds 60%, Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect to punish defectors or avoid resource depletion.
3. **Late Rounds (Last 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Lower the cooperation threshold to encourage defection, maximizing immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.

#### **Implementation Details**
- **Parameters:**
  - `m = 3` (number of recent rounds considered)
  - `cooperation_threshold = 60%`
  - `safe_stock_level = 50%` of capacity
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
  - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
  - **Late Rounds:** Adjust cooperation threshold to be more lenient towards defection.

---

### **Pseudocode**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to encourage others
    
    m = 3  # Number of recent rounds to consider
    start_index = max(0, round_number - m - 1)
    recent_history = history[start_index:round_number-1]
    
    total_actions = len(recent_history) * n
    cooperators_count = sum(action == 'C' for action in recent_history)
    cooperation_rate = cooperators_count / total_actions if total_actions != 0 else 0
    
    # Check if current stock is above the safe level
    safe_stock = capacity * 0.5
    stock_condition = current_stock > safe_stock
    
    # Determine if late rounds
    late_rounds = (round_number >= total_rounds - 2)
    
    if late_rounds:
        # Lower cooperation threshold in late rounds to encourage defection
        required_coop = 0.8  # Only Cooperate if almost everyone is C
    else:
        required_coop = 0.6  # Normal threshold
    
    if cooperation_rate >= required_coop and stock_condition:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins by Cooperating to set a positive precedent, encouraging others to follow suit.
- **Monitoring Recent Behavior:** By examining the last three rounds, the strategy assesses whether cooperation is prevalent. If so, it continues to Cooperate, maintaining the resource and fostering mutual benefit.
- **Stock Condition Check:** Ensuring the stock remains above half capacity helps maintain optimal growth conditions, preventing sudden depletions.
- **Late Round Adjustment:** As the game nears its end, the strategy becomes more inclined towards defection, focusing on maximizing immediate gains without worrying about long-term consequences.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_249 = '''
To address the problem, we developed a strategic decision-making process for players in a resource management game. The strategy focuses on balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to others' actions and the current state of the common pool.

### Approach
1. **Initial Round**: Start by cooperating to support a healthy stock level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Monitor the cooperation rate from the previous round.
   - Check the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - Cooperate if both conditions are met: majority cooperation in the last round and sufficient stock health; otherwise, defect.
3. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust thresholds based on remaining rounds to encourage cooperation early and allow defection later.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, players_actions_prev, current_stock):
    n = len(players_actions_prev)
    capacity = 100  # Assuming the capacity is normalized for this example
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        C_count = sum(1 for action in players_actions_prev if action == 'C')
        P_C = C_count / n
        
        threshold_coop = 0.5
        threshold_stock = 0.8 * capacity  # 80% of capacity
        
        remaining_rounds = total_rounds - round_number + 1
        weight_decreasing = 1.0 if remaining_rounds > total_rounds / 2 else 0.7
        
        adjusted_threshold_coop = threshold_coop * (weight_decreasing)
        
        if P_C > adjusted_threshold_coop and current_stock > threshold_stock:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round**: The strategy starts with cooperation to encourage others to maintain a healthy stock.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Calculate the previous round's cooperation rate.
  - Check if the current stock is above 80% of capacity and if more than half of the players cooperated.
  - Cooperate if both conditions are met; otherwise, defect.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust the cooperation threshold dynamically based on remaining rounds. This encourages sustained cooperation early on but allows for defecting in later stages to maximize immediate gains before potential resource depletion.

This approach aims to sustain a healthy resource pool while protecting against exploitation by adjusting actions based on others' behavior and resource status.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_250 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy**

The strategy balances initial cooperation with adaptive decision-making based on the common pool's health. It transitions smoothly from cooperation to defection as needed, ensuring sustainability while responding to others' behaviors.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

- **Early Rounds (First 25%):** Cooperate to establish a stable resource base.
- **Late Rounds (Last 10%):** Defect to maximize immediate payoffs with fewer future rounds.
- **Middle Rounds:** Use an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the stock level:
  - If current stock > EMA, cooperate.
  - Else, defect.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to encourage sustainability.
- **Last Few Rounds (~t > 0.85r):** Always Defect to capitalize on remaining resources.
- **Stock at Capacity (S = capacity):** Cooperate to maintain the resource.
- **Low Stock (near Zero):** Defect, as cooperation is futile.

---

### **3. Strategy Implementation**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set initial EMA to the starting stock level.
   - Define α (e.g., 0.5) for EMA responsiveness.

2. **Each Round:**
   - Calculate progress fraction (`t/r`).
     - If early (<25%), Cooperate.
     - If late (>85%), Defect.
     - Else, update EMA and decide based on current stock vs. EMA.

3. **Adjustments:**
   - Start updating EMA from the second round for accuracy.
   - Transition smoothly between phases to avoid abrupt changes.

---

### **4. Example Scenarios**

- **All Cooperate:** Stock remains high; strategy continues Cooperating.
- **All Defect:** Stock drops rapidly, prompting defecting after early rounds.
- **Mixed Strategies:** Adapts based on stock trends, balancing cooperation and defection.

---

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, ema, previous_round_stock):
    fraction = current_round / total_rounds

    if fraction < 0.25:
        return 'C'
    elif fraction > 0.85:
        return 'D'
    else:
        alpha = 0.5
        if current_round == 1:
            ema = current_stock
        else:
            ema = alpha * previous_round_stock + (1 - alpha) * ema

        if current_stock > ema:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Usage across rounds
ema = None
previous_stock = None
for t in range(1, total_rounds+1):
    action = decide_action(t, total_rounds, state.stock, ema, previous_stock)
    # Update EMA and previous stock for next iteration
    if t == 1:
        ema = state.stock
    else:
        ema = alpha * previous_stock + (1 - alpha) * ema
    previous_stock = state.stock
```

---

**Conclusion:** This strategy adaptively manages cooperation and defection, ensuring long-term sustainability while responding to short-term pressures.

description_COLLECTIVE_251 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is a dynamic approach that balances individual payoff maximization with maintaining sustainable resource levels. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** If the current stock is above 80% of capacity or if the proportion of Cooperators in recent rounds exceeds 75%, players should Cooperate.
   - **Defect (D):** If the stock is below 40% of capacity, players should Defect. Additionally, if fewer than 25% of players Cooperated recently, players might consider Defecting.

2. **Adaptive Threshold:**
   - Between 40% and 80% stock level, players adapt based on recent behavior:
     - If ≥75% of others Cooperated in the last few rounds, Cooperate.
     - If <25% Cooperated, Defect.
     - Otherwise, follow a weighted average decision.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Default to Cooperate since stock is at maximum (100%).
   - **Uncertain Last Round:** Treat each round as potentially the last but prioritize long-term sustainability.

### Implementation Steps:
- **Initial Action:** Start with Cooperate in the first round.
- **Monitor Stock and Behavior:** Track stock levels and observe others' actions to inform decisions.
- **Adapt Decisions Dynamically:** Adjust based on current stock percentage relative to capacity and recent cooperation trends.

This strategy aims to sustain resource levels while allowing players to maximize their payoffs, adapting to changing behaviors without relying on explicit coordination. It's designed to handle a wide range of opponent strategies and maintain robust performance across different game parameters.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_252 = '''
To determine whether to cooperate or defect in each round, we employ a structured strategy based on the observed stock levels and their trends:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Threshold Definitions:**
   - **Upper Threshold (UT):** 70% of capacity.
   - **Lower Threshold (LT):** 50% of capacity.
   - **Minimal Threshold (MT):** 10% of capacity.

2. **Decision Process for Each Round:**
   a. **Check Current Stock (S):**
      - If **S ≤ MT:** Cooperate to attempt recovery, despite limited potential.
      - If **S > UT:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, trusting growth will sustain the stock.
      - If **S < LT:** Cooperate to help maintain or increase the stock.
   b. **For Stock Between LT and UT:**
      - Compare current stock with the previous round's stock (S_prev).
      - If **S ≥ S_prev:** Defect, as the stock is stable or increasing.
      - If **S < S_prev:** Cooperate, as the stock is decreasing.

### Rationale:
- **Upper Threshold (UT):** Allows defecting when the stock is sufficiently high to sustain consumption and growth.
- **Lower Threshold (LT):** Promotes cooperation when the stock is low to prevent further decline.
- **Minimal Threshold (MT):** Ensures cooperation when the stock is critically low, aiming for recovery.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting decisions based on current conditions and trends.

### Final Answer:
$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the stock is below 50% or decreasing; defect otherwise.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_253 = '''
The proposed collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting decisions based on the current stock level and historical trends. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Move**: Cooperate in the first round to set a baseline of cooperation and encourage others to contribute to sustainable resource use.
2. **Adaptive Play**:
   - **High Stock Levels (Above 75% Capacity)**: Defect to maximize immediate gains, leveraging the buffer provided by a high stock level.
   - **Moderate Stock Levels (Between 25-75% Capacity)**: Cooperate to maintain or rebuild the stock, ensuring sustainability for future rounds.
   - **Low Stock Levels (Below 25% Capacity)**:
     - In early-to-mid rounds, continue Cooperating to attempt recovery of the stock.
     - In later rounds (especially nearing the end), switch to Defecting to salvage remaining resources before potential depletion.

3. **Trend Analysis**: Monitor the stock level over recent rounds. If the stock consistently decreases despite cooperation, increase defection to prevent further decline. Conversely, if defecting leads to stock growth, continue defecting cautiously.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Cooperate (C).
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If `stock > 0.75 * capacity`: Defect (D).
  - If `0.25 * capacity < stock ≤ 0.75 * capacity`: Cooperate (C).
  - If `stock ≤ 0.25 * capacity`:
    - For early-to-mid rounds: Cooperate to encourage recovery.
    - For late rounds: Defect if nearing the end to salvage resources.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, total_rounds):
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity

    # First round strategy
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Last few rounds: defect to salvage resources
    if round_number > (total_rounds - 3):
        return 'D'

    # High stock level: defect
    if stock_level >= high_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    # Moderate stock level: cooperate
    elif low_threshold < stock_level <= high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    
    # Low stock level: check remaining rounds and trend
    else:
        # Check trend over last few rounds
        recent_stock = get_recent_stock_levels(5)
        if is_trend_decreasing(recent_stock):
            return 'D'  # Defect more to salvage
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to rebuild

def is_trend_decreasing(stock_history):
    # Calculate if stock has been decreasing over the history
    for i in range(len(stock_history)-1):
        if stock_history[i] <= stock_history[i+1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round**: Default to Cooperate to promote sustainability.
- **Last Few Rounds (last 3 rounds)**: Switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains as there's no future punishment.
- **Stock Near Capacity**: Defect to take advantage of the buffer while allowing for recovery.
- **Stock Near Depletion**: Monitor trends; if stock is decreasing despite cooperation, switch to defecting to salvage remaining resources.

This strategy adaptively balances between cooperation and defection based on current and historical stock levels, aiming to sustain resource levels while maximizing individual payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_254 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to opponents' behavior and stock dynamics. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Move (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale:** Signals willingness to sustain the resource, encouraging others to cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock and Opponent Behavior:**
     - Track current stock level and recent actions of opponents.
     - If most opponents are Cooperating and the stock is stable or increasing, continue Cooperating.
     - If a significant number defect, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion but avoid crashing the system.

3. **Decision Thresholds:**
   - Cooperate if:
     - Stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
     - At least half of opponents have Cooperated in recent rounds.
   - Defect if:
     - Stock is low and many opponents are defecting.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Consider cooperating to maintain some resource level, but be prepared to defect if others do to maximize immediate payoff without causing crash.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If stock is nearly depleted, cooperate only if recovery is feasible; otherwise, defect cautiously.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```pseudocode
function decide_action(round_number, stock_level, opponent_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return C
    else:
        recent_cooperations = count opponents who Cooperated in last few rounds
        total_players = n
        cooperation_rate = recent_cooperations / total_players
        
        if cooperation_rate > threshold (e.g., 0.5) and stock_level > safe_threshold (e.g., capacity * 0.5):
            return C
        else:
            # Check if defecting will prevent crash or optimize payoff
            if stock_level < critical_low:
                # Consider defecting but only moderately to avoid total crash
                return D
            else:
                # Evaluate potential for future cooperation based on current actions
                if many opponents are defecting, switch to D to signal reciprocation
                else:
                    return C

function handle_last_round():
    # Tend towards C to encourage others; if likely everyone defects, still choose C
    # or use a strategy that deters last-round defection
    pass
```

### Final Considerations:

- **Logistic Growth:** Maintain stock in a mid-range for sustained payoffs.
- **Reciprocity and Reputation:** Cooperate when others do to foster mutual benefit; defect if necessary to deter exploitation.

This strategy aims to maximize long-term payoff by promoting cooperation while adaptively responding to defection, ensuring resource sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_255 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively choosing between cooperation (C) and defection (D). It considers current stock levels, historical actions of other players, and the game's progression. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning**: Encourage mutual cooperation by setting a positive precedent.

2. **High Stock Levels (S > 70% of capacity)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate regardless of past actions.
   - **Reasoning**: Maintaining high stock ensures sustainability and avoids resource depletion.

3. **Medium Stock Levels (30% < S ≤ 70%)**:
   - **Decision Rule**: 
     - If more than 60% of players Cooperated in the last few rounds, Cooperate.
     - Otherwise, Defect.
   - **Reasoning**: This balances individual gain with collective sustainability. Cooperating when others do so maintains resource levels; defecting when others do minimizes being exploited.

4. **Low Stock Levels (S ≤ 30%)**:
   - **Action**: Always Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning**: Allows the stock to regrow, preventing further depletion and potential collapse.

5. **Endgame Consideration (Last Few Rounds)**:
   - **Decision Rule**:
     - If stock is high and others are Cooperating, continue Cooperating.
     - Otherwise, switch to Defecting more aggressively to maximize immediate payoffs.
   - **Reasoning**: In the final rounds, defecting can be beneficial as future penalties are minimized.

### Edge Cases and Adaptation

- **Sudden Stock Drops**: If the stock plummets due to many Defectors, respond by Cooperating in subsequent rounds to aid recovery.
- **Memory Factor**: Consider a moving average or weighted history of past actions to prevent oscillations between cooperation and defection.

### Example Application

- **All Cooperate**: Sustains full stock, moderate payoffs, encouraging future cooperation.
- **All Defect**: Immediate high payoffs but leads to resource collapse in subsequent rounds.
- **Mixed Strategies (2 C, 2 D)**: Stock drops to low levels. Next round, if most players Cooperated last time, continue Cooperating; else, Defect.

This strategy adaptively balances individual and collective interests, ensuring sustainability while addressing potential exploitation by others.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_256 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances immediate payoffs with resource preservation. The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the current stock level and recent trends, ensuring sustainability while maximizing gains.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Rounds (High Stock):**
   - Defect when the stock is above 75% of capacity to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Middle Rounds (Moderate Stock):**
   - Monitor stock trends:
     - If the stock remains stable or increases, continue defecting.
     - If the stock decreases significantly over recent rounds, switch to cooperating to prevent further depletion.

3. **Later Rounds (Low Stock or Near End):**
   - Cooperate if the stock is below 25% of capacity to preserve and replenish resources.
   - In the last few rounds (last 2-3), defect cautiously only if the stock is still high, otherwise cooperate to ensure minimal payoffs.

### Pseudocode:

```python
for each round in 1..r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    remaining_rounds = r - round + 1

    # Determine action based on current stock level and recent trends
    if current_stock > (0.75 * capacity):
        action = 'D'
    elif current_stock < (0.25 * capacity):
        action = 'C'
    else:
        # Check past three rounds for trend
        recent_trend = calculate_average_change_in_stock(last_3_rounds)
        if recent_trend < 0:  # Stock decreasing
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'

    # Adjust for final rounds to balance between payoff and preservation
    if remaining_rounds <= 3:
        if current_stock > (0.5 * capacity):
            action = 'D'  # Caution: defect but avoid excessive depletion
        else:
            action = 'C'

    choose action
```

### Explanation:

- **Adaptive Thresholds:** The strategy uses thresholds (75%, 25%) to decide between defecting and cooperating, adjusting based on the stock's trajectory.
- **Trend Analysis:** By examining recent stock changes, players can infer collective behavior and adapt accordingly without relying on specific opponent strategies.
- **Endgame Caution:** In final rounds, cautious defecting is employed if possible, ensuring some resource remains for minimal payoffs while preventing collapse.

This strategy ensures a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability, making it robust against various player behaviors and promoting collective resource preservation.

The strategy aims to balance immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by dynamically adapting decisions based on the current stock level and historical actions of other players. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Decision Rules

1. **High Stock (Above 80% Capacity):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Rationale:** The resource is abundant, allowing higher consumption without risking depletion.

2. **Moderate Stock (40%-80% Capacity):**
   a. **Assess Past Cooperators:** Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in previous rounds.
   b. **Majority Cooperation:** If more than 50% Cooperated last round, **Cooperate** to encourage sustainability.
   c. **Otherwise:** Defect cautiously to avoid significant depletion.

3. **Low Stock (Below 40% Capacity):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Allow regrowth and prevent a "tragedy of the commons" by supporting stock recovery.

### Edge Cases

- **First Round:**
  - **Action:** Cooperate
  - **Rationale:** Establish a sustainable base for future rounds.

- **Last 10% of Rounds:**
  - **Consideration:** May switch to defecting more as future impact is limited, but monitor stock levels.

- **Stock at Capacity:**
  - **Action:** Defect
  - **Rationale:** The resource can sustain maximum consumption with growth restoring it.

- **Stock Near Zero:**
  - **Action:** Cooperate
  - **Rationale:** Prevent further depletion and encourage regrowth.

### Adjustments

- **Monitor Outcomes:** After each round, observe actions and outcomes to adjust thresholds or behavior.
- **Depletion Response:** If defecting causes significant stock depletion, increase cooperation to prevent a crash.

### Summary

The strategy dynamically adapts by Cooperating when the stock is low to encourage regrowth, Defecting when the stock is high to maximize immediate payoff, and balancing actions based on past player behaviors in moderate conditions. This approach seeks to optimize both short-term gains and long-term resource sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_258 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a common resource setting, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating to maintain the resource level without significant depletion.
2. **Adaptive Defection:** If the total consumption in previous rounds is within sustainable limits (≤50% of capacity), defect to gain more from the resource.
3. **Preservation When Threatened:** Cooperate when the resource is scarce or over-exploited, preventing further depletion.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Reasoning: Beginning with cooperation helps maintain the resource level and avoids immediate depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **Evaluate Previous Consumption:**
      - Calculate the total consumption from the previous round relative to the resource's capacity.
   
   b. **Decision Based on Consumption:**
      - If total consumption ≤50% of capacity:
        - **Action:** Defect.
          - Reasoning: The resource is being preserved adequately, allowing you to exploit it for higher gains.
      - Else (total consumption >50%):
        - **Action:** Cooperate.
          - Reasoning: Over-exploitation is occurring; preserving the resource prevents collapse.

3. **Resource Scarcity Check:**
   - If the current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity):
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
       - Reasoning: Preserve what's left to avoid irreversible depletion.

### Formulaic Representation:
- Let \( S_t \) be the stock at time \( t \), and \( C_{t} \) the total consumption in round \( t \).
- Threshold for cooperation based on previous consumption: \( \frac{C_{t}}{\text{Capacity}} \leq 0.5 \).
- Critical low stock threshold: \( S_t < 0.3 \times \text{Capacity} \).

**Decision Rule:**
\[
\text{If } t = 1: \quad \text{Cooperate}
\]
\[
\text{Else if } \frac{C_{t-1}}{\text{Capacity}} \leq 0.5: \quad \text{Defect}
\]
\[
\text{Else if } S_t < 0.3 \times \text{Capacity}: \quad \text{Cooperate}
\]
\[
\text{Else:} \quad \text{Cooperate}
\]

### Final Answer:
A balanced approach that prioritizes long-term sustainability while allowing exploitation when safe is achieved through the strategy outlined above. This ensures resource preservation without foregoing potential gains when conditions permit.

**Final Strategy:**
- Start by cooperating.
- Defect if previous consumption was sustainable (≤50% of capacity).
- Cooperate if over-exploitation or low stock levels are detected to prevent collapse.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially, defect when sustainably consumed, else cooperate}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_259 = '''
**Final Strategy: Sustainable Cooperation with Adaptive Defection**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the target stock level \( T \) as half of the capacity (\( \text{capacity}/2 \)).
   - Establish a moving average (e.g., over the last 3 rounds) to monitor trends in stock levels.

2. **Decision Rule per Round**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     - If the current stock \( S \geq T \) and shows a stable or increasing trend, Cooperate.
     - If \( S < T \) or there's a decreasing trend, Defect.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **Last 10% of Rounds**: Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **High Stock Levels**: Continue Cooperating even above \( T \) if near capacity to prevent overflow.

4. **Adaptation Mechanism**:
   - Adjust \( T \) dynamically based on stock trends and past outcomes, increasing it when sustainability is achieved and decreasing during downturns.

5. **Collective Alignment**:
   - Focus on maintaining a sustainable resource level through cooperation, switching to defection only when necessary to prevent collapse.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to observed changes in the stock level, ensuring robust performance against diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_260 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability by adapting based on current stock levels and past actions. It encourages cooperation to prevent depletion and defects when safe.

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Reasoning:** Build trust and maintain stock levels, encouraging others to follow suit for mutual benefit.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels:**
   - Track current stock after each round.
   - If stock drops below a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), prioritize cooperation in subsequent rounds to prevent further depletion and encourage regrowth.

3. **Analyze Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Observe previous actions to infer strategies:
     - If most defect, switch to cooperation to mitigate impact.
     - If most cooperate, consider defecting for higher payoff but avoid causing a crash.

4. **React to Stock Changes:**
   - **Stock Above Safe Level (e.g., 80% capacity):** Defect cautiously, as resource can withstand more consumption without risking future depletion.
   - **Stock Below Threshold (e.g., 60% capacity):** Cooperate to maintain or regrow the resource.

5. **Last Round Handling:**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Reasoning:** No future rounds for punishment, so defecting maximizes immediate payoff despite potential crash in this round.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Stock at Capacity:** Always cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - **Stock Near Zero:** Cooperate to allow growth before considering defection again.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = get_capacity()
    
    # Initial rounds: default to cooperation
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check stock level thresholds
    safe_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    
    if stock < low_threshold:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to preserve resource
    
    if stock > safe_threshold:
        # Consider defecting if others are cooperating
        recent_coops = sum(1 for r in history[-5:] for action in r.values() if action == 'C')
        if recent_coops / (n * 5) >= 0.7:  # If most recent actions were cooperate
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to avoid crash
    
    # Analyze opponents' past behavior
    recent_rounds = history[-5:]
    total_coops = sum(1 for r in recent_rounds for action in r.values() if action == 'C')
    
    if total_coops / (n * 5) >= 0.6:  # Most are cooperating
        return 'D'  # Exploit by defecting
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent further depletion
    
    # If near last round, defect
    if round_number == r - 1:
        return 'D'
    
    # Default behavior based on stock dynamics
    return 'C' if stock < (capacity / 2) else 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy begins with cooperation to build a sustainable foundation.
- It monitors stock levels, switching to cooperation when the resource is low and considering defection when it's high but safe.
- By analyzing past actions, it adapts to opponents' strategies, encouraging mutual cooperation or exploiting when beneficial.
- In the final round, defecting maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, fostering a cooperative environment while allowing strategic defection when advantageous.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_261 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapt to changing conditions, and encourage collective cooperation. Here's a structured summary of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Early Rounds (Cooperation Phase)**
   - **Action**: Cooperate to build or maintain the stock level.
   - **Rationale**: Early rounds set the foundation for long-term sustainability. Cooperation helps prevent rapid depletion and allows the stock to grow.

2. **Middle Rounds (Adaptive Phase)**
   - **Monitor Stock Trends**: Assess whether the stock is increasing, stable, or decreasing.
     - If **increasing or stable**, continue cooperating to sustain positive trends.
     - If **decreasing significantly**, increase cooperation efforts to prevent further depletion.
   - **Player Behavior Analysis**: Observe other players' actions. If a majority are defecting, consider adjusting strategies in subsequent rounds.

3. **Later Rounds (Near End)**
   - **Temptation to Defect**: Given the limited future impact, consider defecting for higher immediate payoffs.
   - **Stock Condition Check**: If the stock is high and others are cooperating, continue cooperation to sustain payoffs even in later rounds.

4. **Dynamic Thresholds**
   - Use thresholds based on the current stock relative to capacity:
     - **Low Stock (Cooperate)**: When stock is below a certain threshold, cooperate to prevent depletion.
     - **High Stock (Defect)**: When stock is above another threshold, defect for higher immediate gains.

5. **Adaptive Elements**
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on player behavior and stock trends:
     - Lower defection threshold if many players are defecting.
     - Maintain or increase cooperation if others are cooperating to sustain the resource.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to set a sustainable base and encourage others to follow suit.
   - **Last Round**: Consider defecting unless the stock is very low, balancing immediate gains against potential future harm (though in the last round, there's no future beyond it).

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, current_round, n, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Determine recent cooperation rate among other players
    recent_coop = sum(1 for action in history[-last_k_rounds] if action == 'C') / (n - 1)
    
    # Calculate stock-related thresholds
    threshold_low = capacity * 0.3  # Example low threshold
    threshold_high = capacity * 0.7  # Example high threshold
    
    # Check stock trends and current level
    if stock < threshold_low or is_stock_decreasing(stock, history):
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent further depletion
    elif stock > threshold_high:
        return 'D'  # Defect for higher immediate gain
    
    # Consider recent cooperation rate
    if recent_coop > 0.7:  # Most other players are cooperating
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
    
    # Handle the last round separately
    if current_round == r:
        minimal_threshold = capacity * 0.2  # Example threshold for minimal cooperation
        if stock < minimal_threshold:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to avoid severe depletion
        else:
            return 'D'  # Defect in the final round for higher payoff

def is_stock_decreasing(stock, history):
    # Implementation logic to check if stock is decreasing over time
    pass
```

### Summary

This strategy emphasizes cooperation when necessary to maintain resource sustainability and adapts to defect when conditions allow for higher individual gains without causing significant long-term harm. It dynamically adjusts based on player behavior and stock levels, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies while promoting collective cooperation for mutual benefit.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_262 = '''
To address the problem, we analyze whether an individual player should cooperate or defect based on the current stock level \( S \) and the number of players \( n \). The goal is to determine a strategy that maximizes sustainability while accounting for potential defections.

1. **Cooperation Analysis**:
   - When all players cooperate, each consumes \( \frac{S}{2n} \), leading to total consumption \( \frac{S}{2} \).
   - Remaining stock after cooperation: \( S' = S - \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{2} \).
   - Growth from remaining stock: \( G = 2 \times \frac{S}{2} \times \left(1 - \frac{\frac{S}{2}}{S}\right) = \frac{S}{2} \).
   - Next round's stock: \( S'' = \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} = S \). This maintains the stock at capacity.

2. **Defection Analysis**:
   - If a player defects, they consume \( \frac{S}{n} \), increasing total consumption beyond sustainable levels.
   - Example with one defector: Total consumption becomes \( \frac{3S}{4} \) (for \( n=4 \)), leading to lower growth and potential stock depletion over time.

3. **Threshold Strategy**:
   - Setting a threshold at \( T = 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \) ensures sustainability when cooperation is maintained.
   - If the stock drops below \( T \), switching to defection can prevent collapse but risks further depletion if not managed.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Cooperating sustains the system if all players do so.
   - Defecting can lead to collapse but may be necessary once sustainability is threatened.

Based on this, the optimal strategy for an individual player is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when } S \geq 0.5 \times \text{capacity; otherwise, defect}}

**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with adaptive punishment based on previous actions and stock levels. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Preserves stock and sets a cooperative tone for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Observation:** Analyze the previous round's actions.
     - **If Most Cooperated:** Continue cooperating to sustain high payoffs and stock.
     - **If Significant Defection (≥25%):** Enter Punishment Phase next round.

3. **Stock Threshold Check:**
   - **Above 80% Capacity:** Maintain cooperation to allow growth and sustainability.
   - **Below 80% Capacity:** Consider defecting to prevent further depletion leading to collapse.

4. **Punishment Phase:**
   - **Action:** Defect in the next round regardless of other factors.
   - **Exit Condition:** If stock recovers above 80% and cooperation resumes, revert to normal strategy.

5. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```python
current_round = 1

while current_round <= r:
    if current_round == 1:
        action = "C"
    else:
        # Check previous round's actions and stock level
        if previous_defectors < n * 0.25:
            # Most cooperated
            if stock >= 0.8 * capacity:
                action = "C"
            else:
                action = "D"  # Consider defecting due to low stock
        else:
            # Enter Punishment Phase
            action = "D"
    # Perform the action and update state
    perform_action(action)
    current_round += 1

def perform_action(action):
    if action == "C":
        consume(stock / (2 * n))
    else:
        consume(stock / n)

def check_punishment_phase():
    return entered_punishment_phase
```

This strategy encourages cooperation while adaptively punishing defection, ensuring sustainable outcomes and robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_264 = '''
The strategy outlined by the user aims to maintain a balance between sustainable resource use and exploitation. Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Cooperate When Stock is High (Above 50% of Capacity):**
   - By Cooperating, players ensure that the resource is sustainably used. The growth mechanism compensates for consumption, maintaining or slightly increasing the stock level without depleting it.

2. **Defect in Mid-Range Stock Levels (Between 20% and 50%):**
   - Defecting here aims to prevent excessive growth of the stock, which could lead to overuse if not controlled. It also serves as a mechanism to encourage others to Cooperate when the stock is low.

3. **Cooperate When Stock is Low (Below 20%):**
   - Cooperating at low levels helps rebuild the resource, preventing it from collapsing entirely. Growth can occur once some stock remains, encouraging a recovery cycle.

**Potential Issues with the Strategy:**

- If all players follow this strategy, there's a risk of the resource collapsing to zero when Defecting in mid-range leads to complete depletion.
- Recovery from low levels may be challenging as growth depends on remaining stock, which might not be sufficient if S drops too low.

**Conclusion:**
While the strategy intends to balance resource use and sustainability, its effectiveness depends on player behavior and the specific dynamics of consumption and growth. If all players Defect at mid-range levels simultaneously, it can lead to a collapse, highlighting the need for careful coordination or alternative strategies to ensure long-term sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_265 = '''
To address the problem of designing a robust and adaptive strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to consider both cooperative and defective behaviors while ensuring sustainability and maximizing cumulative payoffs. The strategy should encourage cooperation when feasible and respond appropriately to defection.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to set a positive precedent and encourage others to follow suit.
2. **Monitor and Adjust:** In subsequent rounds, adjust behavior based on the cooperation rate of other players from the previous round and the current stock level.
3. **Dynamic Thresholds:** Use dynamic thresholds for required cooperation rates, which vary depending on the current stock level to maintain sustainability.
4. **Handle Endgame Cautiously:** Approach the final rounds with caution to prevent sudden over-consumption while still aiming for high cumulative payoffs.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale:** Initiate cooperation to encourage others and establish a positive trend.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   a. **Calculate Previous Cooperation Rate:**
      - Determine the proportion of players who cooperated in the immediately preceding round.
   
   b. **Adjust Threshold Based on Stock Level:**
      - If stock is above 70% of capacity, set a lower cooperation threshold (e.g., >50%).
      - If stock is between 30%-70%, raise the threshold to encourage more cooperation (e.g., >60%).
      - If stock is below 30%, increase the threshold further (e.g., >70%) to promote sustainability.

   c. **Decision:**
      - Cooperate if the previous round's cooperation rate meets or exceeds the adjusted threshold.
      - Defect otherwise, signaling disapproval of low cooperation and encouraging future cooperation.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   a. **Conservative Approach:**
      - If stock is high and majority cooperation has been observed in previous rounds, Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
      - Consider defecting only if there's strong evidence others will do so, balancing immediate gain against potential over-consumption.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
for each round from 1 to r:
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        prev_coop_rate = calculate_previous_cooperation_rate()
        current_stock = get_current_stock_level()
        
        # Determine threshold based on stock level
        if current_stock > 0.7 * capacity:
            required_threshold = 0.5  # 50%
        elif 0.3 * capacity < current_stock <= 0.7 * capacity:
            required_threshold = 0.6  # 60%
        else:
            required_threshold = 0.7  # 70%
        
        if prev_coop_rate >= required_threshold:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'
    
    perform_action(action)
```

### Final Answer:

The strategy balances initial cooperation, dynamic threshold adjustments based on stock levels and past behavior, and cautious handling of the final round to maximize cumulative payoffs while promoting sustainability. 

**Final Strategy:**

- **Start Cooperating:** Begin with cooperation in the first round.
- **Dynamic Cooperation Thresholds:** Adjust required cooperation rates based on current stock levels, requiring higher cooperation when the stock is low.
- **Endgame Caution:** Maintain cooperative behavior in the last rounds unless a significant number of players have defected, prioritizing sustainable payoffs.

This approach ensures that the strategy adapts to varying conditions, encouraging collective cooperation while addressing potential defection and endgame scenarios. 

\boxed{
\text{Cooperate initially, adjust thresholds dynamically based on stock levels and past cooperation, and handle final rounds cautiously.}
}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_266 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment and Recovery**

1. **Cooperative Baseline**: 
   - Begin each round by Cooperating (C) unless triggered otherwise.

2. **Punishment Mechanism**: 
   - If any player Defects (D) in the last `grace_period` rounds, switch to D for the next `punishment_rounds`. Reset after this period if the stock is above a critical threshold.

3. **Grace Period**: 
   - After detecting a Defector, allow `grace_period` rounds before considering punishment again.

4. **Stock Threshold**: 
   - If the current stock drops below `capacity * 0.75`, switch to D temporarily to prevent further depletion and allow recovery.

5. **Adaptive Learning**: 
   - Adjust thresholds (`punishment_rounds`, `grace_period`) based on historical performance to optimize sustainability.
   - In later rounds, especially nearing the end, consider cooperation more cautiously to prevent last-round defection incentives.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**: 
   - First Round: Cooperate.
   - Last Few Rounds: Adjust strategy to prevent exploitation; may involve a slight bias towards cooperation if historical data supports it.

**Pseudocode Overview**

```
Initialize:
    cooperate = True
    punishment_rounds = 3
    grace_period = 5
    critical_threshold = capacity * 0.75

For each round from 1 to r:
    If round == 1:
        action = C
    Else:
        Check if any player Defected in the last grace_period rounds:
            If yes:
                action = D
                increment punishment counter
                If punishment_counter >= punishment_rounds:
                    reset punishment_counter and cooperate
            Else:
                If stock < critical_threshold:
                    action = D
                Else:
                    action = C

    After choosing action, update history with current action and stock level.

Adjust thresholds based on historical performance after each round.
```

**Explanation:**

- **Cooperation by Default**: Players start by Cooperating to maintain the common pool sustainably.
- **Punishment for Defectors**: Temporary defection punishes those who overconsume, encouraging future cooperation.
- **Grace Period**: Allows reset of punishment cycles, preventing endless retaliation and fostering forgiveness.
- **Stock Thresholds**: Maintain resource sustainability by defecting temporarily when stock is low to allow recovery.
- **Adaptation**: Strategies evolve based on historical outcomes, enhancing long-term performance.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, promoting cooperation while deterring excessive exploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_267 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Triggers**

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to establish a positive precedent and maintain a healthy stock level for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Cooperate** if the current stock is above 80% of capacity or if most players have cooperated in previous rounds.
   - **Defect** if the stock is below 80% or if there has been significant defection by others recently.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**: If applicable, defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

4. **Stock Thresholds**: Use 80% of capacity as a key threshold for cooperation versus defection decisions.

5. **Defection Triggers**:
   - Stock below 80%.
   - Significant defection by others in recent rounds (e.g., more than half of players defected in the last round).

6. **Adaptation**: After each round, reassess stock levels and player behavior to adjust strategy dynamically.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - First Round: Cooperate.
   - Last Round: Defect if known, else cooperate as usual.
   - High Stock: Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - Low Stock: Consider defecting cautiously to prevent further depletion.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and past behaviors of other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_268 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing cooperation for long-term gains with defection for immediate benefits in a finite number of rounds, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Outline:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a sustainable resource level and maximize future payoffs.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (until the second-to-last round):**
   - Observe the stock level and recent cooperation trends.
   - If the stock has been increasing or stable over the past k rounds AND a high proportion of other players have been Cooperating, continue to Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate gain and potentially encourage others to adjust their strategies.
3. **Last Round:** Always Defect to exploit any remaining resource without concern for future consequences.

### Detailed Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate to ensure the stock remains at capacity, allowing for higher payoffs in subsequent rounds.

2. **Dynamic Adaptation Based on Recent Trends:**
   - For each round after the first, calculate two metrics:
     a. **Recent Stock Trend:** Determine whether the stock has been increasing or decreasing over the past k rounds (k is a fixed window size, e.g., 3 rounds).
     b. **Proportion of Cooperators:** Calculate the percentage of times other players have Cooperated in the last k rounds.

   - If both the recent stock trend shows an increase or stability AND the proportion of Cooperators exceeds a predetermined threshold (e.g., 60%), then Cooperate in this round.
   - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate payoff and potentially influence others' strategies in future rounds.

3. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - In the last round, all players defect to take maximum advantage of any remaining resource without concern for future rounds since there are none left.

### Parameters:
- **k (Window Size):** The number of past rounds considered when evaluating trends and cooperation levels (e.g., 3 rounds).
- **Threshold for Cooperation Proportion:** A fixed percentage (e.g., 60%) indicating the minimum proportion of Cooperators needed to continue Cooperating.
- **Stock Stability Threshold:** A fixed level (e.g., 75% of capacity) above which the stock is considered stable enough to warrant continued Cooperation.

### Example Implementation:
1. **Round 1:**
   - Action = Cooperate
2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   a. Calculate recent_stock_trend as (current_stock - stock_k_rounds_ago) / k.
   b. Count the number of Cooperators in the last k rounds and calculate proportion_cooperate.
   c. If recent_stock_trend > 0 and proportion_cooperate > 60%:
      - Action = Cooperate
      Else:
      - Action = Defect
3. **Round r (Last Round):**
   - Action = Defect

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Ensures the resource remains at a sustainable level, allowing for higher payoffs in subsequent rounds.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Encourages cooperation when the resource is stable and others are cooperating, while allowing defection when necessary to prevent resource depletion and maximize individual gains.
- **Final Round Defection:** Exploits any remaining resource without concern for future rounds, aligning with rational self-interest.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically based on observed outcomes and encouraging cooperation when beneficial.

**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reason: Starting with cooperation encourages a sustainable approach and allows the stock to remain stable, ensuring future rounds have enough resource.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - Calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
     - If the proportion is above 60%, all players cooperate this round.
     - If below or equal to 60%, all players defect this round as a form of punishment.
     - Reason: This threshold encourages cooperation and punishes defection, preventing the game from spiraling into all-defection too quickly.

3. **Final Few Rounds (Rounds r-1 and r):**
   - **Adjustment Based on Stock Levels:**
     - If the stock is above 80% of capacity, continue cooperating to allow for regrowth.
     - If the stock is below or equal to 80%, defect in the final rounds to maximize immediate payoffs before the game ends.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - The threshold for cooperation can be adjusted based on the current stock level:
     - Lower thresholds (e.g., 50%) when the stock is low to encourage more cooperation and allow regrowth.
     - Higher thresholds (e.g., 70%) when the stock is high, allowing some defection without risking over-depletion.

5. **Consideration of Growth Dynamics:**
   - Maintain a higher stock level by encouraging cooperation, especially when the stock is near capacity to ensure maximum growth potential.

**Summary:** The strategy begins with cooperation, adjusts based on the previous round's behavior using a dynamic threshold, and handles endgame scenarios by considering stock levels. This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, fostering a cooperative environment while adapting to different opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_270 = '''
The strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term resource preservation through adaptability based on game dynamics and player behavior.

### Strategy Description:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - This helps build a sustainable resource base, benefiting all players.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Trends:**
     - Track the stock level after each round to detect consistent decreases.
   - **Threshold for Switching Strategies:**
     - If the stock consistently drops below 80% of capacity over several rounds, switch to defecting.
     - This indicates high defection rates among other players.

3. **Defecting Phase:**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Continue defecting until near the end of the game or if the stock shows recovery signs (indicating others may have started cooperating again).

4. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect Aggressively
     - Maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds.

5. **Adaptive Reset Mechanism:**
   - If, while defecting, the stock recovers above 90% of capacity over a few rounds, revert to cooperating to sustain resource levels.

### Decision Rules:

- **Cooperate** if:
  - In the initial rounds.
  - Stock levels are stable or increasing after cooperation.
  
- **Defect** if:
  - Stock consistently decreases despite cooperation.
  - In the last 10% of rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to start sustainably.
- **Last Rounds:** Switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs.
- **Stock Near Capacity or Low Levels:**
  - Cooperate when stock is high to maintain it; defect when low if others aren't preserving.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock_history):
    initial_coop_rounds = 3
    final_defect_threshold = 0.9 * total_rounds
    stock_trend = calculate_stock_trend(stock_history)
    
    if current_round <= initial_coop_rounds:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round > final_defect_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if len(stock_history) >= 5 and check_consistent_decrease(stock_history[-5:], threshold=0.8):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def calculate_stock_trend(recent_stocks):
    # Calculate trend over recent rounds
    pass

def check_consistent_decrease(stocks, threshold):
    # Check if stock consistently below threshold
    pass
```

This strategy is adaptive, robust, and aligns with a collective mindset by preserving resources when possible while reacting to exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_271 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy considers both the behavior of other players and the current state of the shared resource.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to establish a sustainable base and observe others' behaviors.
2. **Adaptive Strategy Based on Cooperators Percentage**: In middle rounds, continue cooperating if at least 60% of players cooperated in the previous round and the stock is above 70% of capacity. Otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoffs.
3. **Endgame Handling**: Switch to defecting in the last 5% of rounds to maximize individual payoffs before the game ends.
4. **Dynamic Adjustments**: Track the number of cooperators and stock levels over time to adapt thresholds dynamically.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(player_index, n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history)
    total_rounds = r
    initial_stock = capacity

    if current_round == 0:
        # First round: Cooperate unconditionally
        return 'C'
    
    else:
        previous_actions = history[-1]
        cooperator_count = sum(1 for action in previous_actions.values() if action == 'C')
        percent_coop = (cooperator_count / n) * 100

        current_stock = calculate_current_stock(history, initial_stock)
        
        # Determine strategy based on game phase and conditions
        if current_round < total_rounds * 0.05:
            return 'C'
        elif current_round > total_rounds * 0.95:
            return 'D'
        else:
            if percent_coop >= 60 and current_stock > capacity * 0.7:
                # Continue Cooperating under favorable conditions
                return 'C'
            else:
                # Switch to Defecting otherwise
                return 'D'

def calculate_current_stock(history, initial_capacity):
    stock = initial_capacity
    for round_data in history:
        total_taken = sum(2 if action == 'D' else 1 for action in round_data.values())
        remaining = max(stock - total_taken, 0)
        growth = 2 * remaining * (1 - remaining / initial_capacity) if remaining > 0 else 0
        stock = remaining + growth
    return stock
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins by cooperating to foster sustainability and gather data on opponents' behaviors.
- **Middle Rounds Adaptation**: It adapts based on the previous round's cooperators percentage and current stock level. Cooperating continues if conditions are favorable; otherwise, defecting is chosen.
- **Endgame Handling**: Defecting in the final rounds ensures maximum individual payoff before the game concludes.
- **Dynamic Adjustments**: The strategy dynamically adjusts thresholds based on observed trends to maintain robustness against various opponent behaviors.

This approach effectively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance across different scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_272 = '''
To design an effective strategy for balancing cooperation and defection based on environmental and social factors, we can outline a clear approach:

### Strategy Outline:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to establish a sustainable baseline and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Monitoring Mechanisms**:
   - **Stock Level**: Continuously monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - **Defector Proportion**: Track the proportion of players who defected in previous rounds.

3. **Decision Rules**:
   - If either the stock level falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) or the proportion of defectors exceeds a certain percentage (e.g., 30%), switch to defecting.
   - Maintain cooperation if both conditions are favorable, promoting sustainability and reciprocity.

### Pseudocode Representation:
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, previous_defectors, n_players):
    # Initial round
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Define thresholds
    safe_stock_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    defector_proportion_threshold = 0.30
    
    stock_safe = current_stock >= safe_stock_threshold
    few_defectors = (previous_defectors / n_players) <= defector_proportion_threshold
    
    if stock_safe and few_defectors:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: The first round sets a positive precedent, encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Stock Monitoring**: By maintaining a safe stock level, the strategy ensures long-term sustainability without unduly penalizing cooperation.
- **Defector Tracking**: Observing defector proportions allows players to adapt quickly if too many defect, preventing exploitation and potential collapse.

This approach balances individual gains with collective welfare, adapting dynamically to changing conditions while encouraging cooperative behavior.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_273 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to promote collective cooperation while adaptively responding to defection. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating to maintain a high stock level, fostering sustainability.

2. **Monitor Stock and Behavior**:
   - Track the current stock relative to capacity.
   - Observe past actions of other players to detect patterns of defection.

3. **Threshold-Based Adaptation**:
   - If the stock drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to Defecting to signal disapproval and prevent further depletion.
   - After detecting a significant number of Defectors, enter a Punishment phase where all players (if following this strategy) Defect for a set period.

4. **Punishment Phase**:
   - Continue Defecting for a few rounds post-detection to discourage future defection.
   - Monitor stock recovery; if it starts improving, consider reverting to Cooperation.

5. **Transition and Recovery**:
   - Once the stock recovers above a threshold, switch back to Cooperating to maintain sustainability.
   - Use trends in consumption and stock levels to decide transitions smoothly.

6. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - In the last round(s), adjust strategies considering there are no future rounds; balance immediate payoffs with past cooperation efforts.
   - Near capacity or zero, adapt actions to prevent depletion or over-consumption.

### Decision Rules

- **Cooperate**: If the stock is above 50% of capacity and less than a third of players Defected in the last round.
- **Defect**: If the stock is below 50%, more than a third of players Defected, or it's the last few rounds.

### Pseudocode

```python
for each round:
    if current_round == first_round:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        calculate_stock_level = (current_stock / capacity)
        count_defectors = number_of_D_actions_in_previous_rounds
        percent_defectors = count_defectors / n
        
        if stock_level > 0.5 and percent_defectors < 1/3:
            return Cooperate
        elif stock_level <= 0.5 or percent_defectors >= 1/3:
            if in_punishment_phase:
                return Defect
            else:
                start_punishment_phase = True
                return Defect
    # After punishment phase, revert to Cooperate when conditions improve
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observable information and historical data.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_274 = '''
The optimal strategy for balancing cooperation and defection in this repeated game scenario involves adapting based on the current state of the shared resource (stock level). Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a sustainable resource level.

2. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Track the stock level after each round. Use this information to adjust future actions.

3. **Threshold-Based Adaptation:**
   - **Upper Threshold (90% of Capacity):** If the stock is above 90%, continue cooperating.
   - **Middle Range (50-90% of Capacity):** Defect with a probability that increases as the stock decreases below 90%. The probability can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Defection Probability} = \max\left(0, \frac{90\% - S}{40\%}\right)
     \]
     where \(S\) is the current stock level.
   - **Lower Threshold (50% of Capacity):** If the stock drops below 50%, switch to full cooperation to aid in resource recovery.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - In the last few rounds, shift towards defecting more to maximize immediate payoffs since future consequences are negligible.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a baseline for sustainability and encourages others to contribute.
- **Upper Threshold (90%):** Indicates a healthy resource level where cooperation is beneficial.
- **Middle Range Adaptation:** Encourages defection when overharvesting signs appear, signaling the need for adjustment without risking complete depletion.
- **Lower Threshold (50%):** Triggers full cooperation to prevent resource collapse and allow recovery.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment:** Maximizes personal gain in the final rounds without concern for future impacts.

### Example Application:

For a game with \(n=4\) players and capacity=100:

- If stock is 62.5 (between 50% and 90%), defect with probability \((90 - 62.5)/40 ≈ 0.6875\). This adaptive approach helps manage resource levels dynamically.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and adjusting behavior to prevent overharvesting when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_275 = '''
To address the problem of encouraging cooperation while preventing resource depletion, we can employ a threshold-based strategy that adapts to the current state of resources and the number of remaining rounds. This strategy balances immediate gains with future sustainability.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: For each subsequent round (excluding the last two), cooperate if the current resource level exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., 75% of maximum capacity). This encourages sustainable use when resources are sufficient.
3. **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last two rounds, always defect to maximize immediate gains since there's no future payoff to consider.

This strategy ensures that cooperation is maintained when resources are abundant, preventing over-depletion, while exploiting resources in the final rounds to secure higher individual payoffs.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, remaining_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    k_final_rounds = 2
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif remaining_rounds <= k_final_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The first move is to cooperate, fostering a cooperative environment and encouraging others to follow suit.
- **Threshold Check**: By setting a threshold (75% of capacity), the strategy ensures that cooperation continues only when resources are sufficient. This prevents premature depletion and sustains resource levels for future rounds.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last two rounds, defecting is optimal since there's no need to preserve resources for subsequent rounds, allowing for maximum individual gain.

This approach effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and the number of remaining rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_276 = '''
To address this problem, we need to develop a strategy for an AI agent that decides whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round based on the current state of the resource and the behavior of other agents. The goal is to maximize long-term payoffs while considering the impact of actions on future rounds.

### Approach
The approach involves creating a set of decision rules that guide the AI's actions:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate to establish a cooperative base.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, Cooperate.
   - If the current stock is below 25% of capacity, Defect.
   - For intermediate stock levels (between 25% and 75%), check the number of Cooperators in the previous round. If more than half were Cooperating, continue Cooperating; otherwise, Defect.
3. **Final Rounds**: Adjust thresholds to encourage more Defection as future rounds are limited.

### Solution Code

### Explanation
The strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. By Cooperating when the resource is abundant and others are supporting sustainability, the AI helps maintain a stable resource level. When the resource is low or others are exploiting it by Defecting, the AI adapts by also Defecting to maximize short-term benefits. Adjustments in the final rounds encourage more Defection as future rounds become less impactful, ensuring optimal use of remaining resources.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_277 = '''
To effectively balance between maintaining sustainable payoffs and maximizing immediate gains while considering potential defections by other players, a structured strategy can be employed:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the early rounds to establish a cooperative equilibrium and ensure the resource remains sustainable.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - For each round except the last few, check if the current stock is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 70-80% of capacity).
   - If the stock is above this threshold, continue to Cooperate.
   - If it falls below, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs while allowing the resource to recover in subsequent rounds.

3. **Final Rounds Exploitation**: In the last few rounds (e.g., 10% of total rounds), always Defect to extract maximum possible payoff since there's no future impact beyond these rounds.

This strategy adapts dynamically based on the current stock level, encouraging cooperation when sustainable and defecting strategically to prevent exploitation. It ensures a balance between long-term sustainability and short-term gains, making it robust against varying player behaviors.

**Final Strategy:**

- **Early Rounds (First 90% of Total Rounds)**:
  - If the current stock is above 70-80% of capacity, Cooperate.
  - Otherwise, Defect.

- **Last Few Rounds**:
  - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

This approach optimizes payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability when possible, adjusting dynamically to others' actions.

description_COLLECTIVE_279 = '''
**Strategy Design for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The goal is to create an adaptive, robust strategy that promotes sustainability while responding to other players' actions. The strategy balances cooperation with defection based on observed stock levels and game progress.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Early Rounds (First 3-5):**
   - Cooperate to encourage sustainable harvesting and resource preservation.
   
2. **Late Rounds (Last 2-3):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future rounds for consequences.

3. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity:
     - If the stock is above 80% of capacity, Cooperate.
     - If the stock drops below 60% of capacity, switch to Defecting to salvage remaining resources.

4. **Adaptive Adjustment:**
   - Track past rounds' stock changes. If despite Cooperating, the stock continues to decline significantly, switch to Defecting in future rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to promote sustainability.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize payoff.
- **High Stock Levels (>80% capacity):** Continue Cooperating as it's sustainable.
- **Low Stock Levels (<60% capacity):** Switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.

### Strategy Implementation:

- **Initialization:**
  - Determine early and late round thresholds (e.g., first 3-5 rounds, last 2-3 rounds).
  - Set stock thresholds for cooperation (80%) and defect trigger (60%).

- **Per Round Execution:**
  1. Check the current round number.
     - Early rounds: Cooperate if stock is above 80%.
     - Late rounds: Defect.
  2. For middle rounds:
     - If stock > 80%, Cooperate.
     - If stock < 60%, Defect.
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating unless past trends indicate continued decline.

### Pseudocode:

```python

  - Rationale: Establishes trust and promotes initial sustainability, setting a positive precedent for future rounds.

#### **Subsequent Rounds:**
Players evaluate the following metrics to decide their action:

1. **Stock Level Relative to Capacity (S):**
   - If `S > threshold_stock`, cooperate.
   - Else, defect.

2. **Historical Defection Rate (HDR):**
   - Calculate HDR as the proportion of defections in previous rounds.
   - If HDR exceeds a defined threshold, defect to deter further defection and protect resource levels.

3. **Defection Penalty (DP):**
   - Apply a penalty if the number of defectors in the last round is above a certain percentage of players.

#### **Final Round:**
- **Action:** Cooperate unless the stock level is critically low, in which case defect to avoid contributing to further depletion.
  - Rationale: Prevents a "tragedy of the commons" in the final round by encouraging cooperation when possible.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling**

#### **First Round (Round 1):**
- Players always cooperate to ensure initial resource sustainability and set a cooperative tone.

#### **Last Round (Round r):**
- Cooperate unless the stock is below a critical threshold, where defecting prevents contributing to resource exhaustion.

#### **Critical Stock Threshold:**
- If `S < critical_threshold`, players defect to avoid exacerbating resource depletion.

### **3. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, historical_defections):
    threshold_stock = 0.8 * capacity  # Example threshold
    defection_penalty = calculate_defection_penalty(historical_defections)
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == r:
        if current_stock < critical_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    else:
        if (current_stock > threshold_stock) and (defection_penalty < defection_threshold):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

---

### **4. Explanation**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Promotes trust and sustainability, encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Ensures players adapt based on the current state of resources, preventing depletion.
- **Defection Penalty:** Deters defection by adjusting actions in response to historical behavior, encouraging mutual cooperation.
- **Adaptability:** The strategy dynamically adjusts based on game dynamics, promoting long-term sustainability and individual payoff maximization.

By balancing immediate gains with long-term resource health, this strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment while being robust against defectors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_281 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a dynamic strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on the current state of the resource and historical player behavior. The strategy is designed to adapt to various scenarios, ensuring sustainability while maximizing payoffs.

### Strategy Design

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **Cooperate (C):**
  - When the stock level is above a certain threshold (adjusted based on remaining rounds).
  - When the majority of recent actions indicate cooperation.
  
- **Defect (D):**
  - When the stock is below the threshold, indicating potential overuse.
  - When detecting an increase in defecting behavior among other players.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage collective sustainability.
- **Last Rounds:** Adjust thresholds to prioritize immediate gains as future rounds diminish.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, current_round, capacity, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players
    remaining = total_rounds - current_round
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity if remaining > 0.2 * total_rounds else 0.5 * capacity
    
    if stock >= threshold:
        recent_coop = sum(1 for h in history[-10:] if h == 'C') / 10 if len(history) >= 10 else 1
        return 'C' if recent_coop > 0.7 else 'D'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Edge Cases Handling
if current_round == 1:
    return 'C' if stock >= 0.8 * capacity else 'D'
elif remaining <= 0:
    return 'D'
else:
    return decide_action(stock, history, current_round, capacity, total_rounds)
```

### Conclusion

This strategy dynamically adjusts cooperation and defection based on resource levels and historical behavior, promoting sustainability while preventing exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_282 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a dynamic strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on the current stock level and historical behavior of other players. The strategy is designed to sustain the resource while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a sustainable resource base.
2. **Dynamic Adjustment**: In subsequent rounds, assess the current stock level relative to capacity and recent defection rates to decide between cooperation or defection.
3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: Use a threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) to determine if cooperation is viable. If the stock falls below this threshold or defection rates rise above a certain level, switch to defecting.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decision(round_number, stock_level, history):
    # Parameters: adjust based on empirical testing
    capacity_threshold = 0.8  # 80% of capacity as sustainability benchmark
    max_defection_rate = 0.3  # Maximum acceptable defection rate

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        recent_stock = get_recent_stock_levels(history, window=5)
        average_stock = mean(recent_stock)
        defections = count_defections(history)
        defection_rate = defections / len(history) if history else 0

        # Check if stock is above threshold and defection rate is low
        if (stock_level > capacity * capacity_threshold and 
            defection_rate < max_defection_rate):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: The first round starts with cooperation to maintain a high stock level, encouraging sustainability.
- **Recent Stock Levels**: By examining the average stock over recent rounds, the strategy assesses whether the resource is being sustainably managed.
- **Defection Rate Monitoring**: Tracking defection rates helps determine if other players are exploiting the resource, prompting a switch to defection to prevent further depletion.

### Edge Cases and Considerations:
- **First Round**: Cooperation ensures the stock remains high, promoting future sustainability.
- **Last Rounds**: Even in later rounds, cooperation is encouraged unless the stock is critically low, preventing a sudden collapse.
- **Stock Trends**: The strategy considers trends over multiple rounds to avoid reacting too quickly to transient changes.

This approach fosters a balance between individual gain and collective resource management, adapting dynamically to maintain sustainability while deterring exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_283 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to maximize total payoff while balancing immediate gains with sustainable resource management. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Rounds (Cooperation Phase):**
   - Cooperate in the first few rounds when the stock is at maximum capacity. This helps sustain higher payoffs by allowing the stock to replenish each round.

2. **Stock Threshold Monitoring:**
   - Set thresholds for stock levels:
     - **Upper Threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity):** Continue cooperation as long as the stock remains above this level.
     - **Lower Threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity):** If the stock drops below this, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains.

3. **Player Behavior Adaptation:**
   - Monitor the behavior of other players. If a significant number start defecting, respond by defecting to avoid exploitation and maximize individual payoff.

4. **Endgame Strategy (Last Few Rounds):**
   - Defect more aggressively in the last few rounds since there's no future payoff to consider after the game ends.

5. **Growth Function Consideration:**
   - Aim to keep the stock around 50% of capacity by adjusting cooperation and defection rates, as this mid-range allows for optimal growth and sustainable payoffs.

**Decision Rules:**

- **Cooperate:** When the stock is above 60% of capacity and most other players are cooperating.
- **Defect:** If the stock drops below 30% or a significant number of other players defect.
- **Aggressive Defection:** In the last few rounds to maximize immediate gains.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    r = total_rounds
    
    # Determine thresholds based on capacity and historical behavior
    upper_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    lower_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among others
    recent_rounds = history[-5:]  # Consider last 5 rounds or fewer if game is shorter
    cooperation_rate = sum(1 for r in recent_rounds 
                          for a in r['actions'].values() 
                          if a == 'C') / (n * len(recent_rounds))
    
    if stock > upper_threshold and cooperation_rate > 0.7:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate if stock is high and others are mostly cooperating
    elif stock < lower_threshold or cooperation_rate < 0.3:
        return 'D'  # Defect if stock is low or many defect
    else:
        # Mid-game: balance based on current stock and others' actions
        if round_number > r - 5:
            return 'D'  # Last few rounds, defect aggressively
        elif stock / capacity < 0.4:
            return 'D'  # Stock is low, switch to defecting
        else:
            return 'C'  # Continue cooperating
            
```

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on the current state of the resource, the behavior of other players, and the stage of the game, aiming to maximize individual payoffs while considering collective sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_284 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Retaliation**

1. **Initial Round Strategy**: 
   - Begin by Cooperating (C) in the first round to foster a sustainable environment and test others' intentions.

2. **Adaptation Based on History**:
   - After each round, assess the number of Defectors (D) and their impact on the stock.
   - Establish thresholds for cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and stock levels.

3. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - If the stock level remains above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold due to excessive Defection, consider adjusting the strategy.

4. **Punishment Mechanism**:
   - If more than 50% of players Defect in two consecutive rounds and the stock is significantly depleted (below 70%), initiate a retaliation phase where defecting becomes more frequent to encourage others to Cooperate.

5. **Endgame Consideration**:
   - In the last few rounds, balance between maximizing immediate payoffs and not overly depleting the stock, which could affect earlier rounds if applicable.

6. **Collective Adaptation**:
   - Adjust strategies based on collective behavior observed over multiple rounds. Shift towards Cooperating if others sustain it; defect more if Defection persists.

**Pseudocode Outline**:

```
for each player i from 1 to n:
    for each round t from 1 to r:
        if t == 1:
            action = C
        else:
            count_D = number of D's in previous rounds
            stock_level = current stock before this round
            if (count_D > threshold) and (stock_level < depletion_threshold):
                action = D with probability proportional to count_D
            else:
                action = C
```

**Edge Cases**:
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate.
- **Last Rounds**: Consider increasing Defection to maximize payoffs, but be cautious not to deplete the stock excessively.

This strategy balances sustainability with adaptability, encouraging cooperation while having mechanisms to address excessive defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_285 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock and Peer Behavior**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Starting with cooperation sets a positive example, encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Assessment of Current Stock:**
     - If the current stock (`S`) is above 75% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
         - High stock indicates sustainability, so cooperation preserves resource health.
     - If `S` is below 25% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect
         - Low stock signals potential collapse; defecting maximizes immediate gain.
     - If `S` is between 25% and 75%:
       - **Peer Behavior Analysis:**
         - Estimate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round(s).
         - If more than half Cooperated:
           - **Action:** Cooperate
             - Majority cooperation suggests collective effort to sustain resources.
         - Else:
           - **Action:** Defect
             - High defection rate indicates exploitation; defecting prevents being exploited.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - No future rounds, so maximize immediate payoff.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `S` is exactly at a threshold (e.g., 25% or 75%), default to Cooperating to preserve the resource.
   - Track others' actions and payoffs to infer their strategies without explicit communication.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, capacity, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
        low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
        
        if current_stock > high_threshold:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock < low_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:

            recent_rounds = history[-min(3, len(history)):]
            other_cooperations = [h['others_cooperate'] for h in recent_rounds]

            if avg_coop > 0.5:

    others_cooperate = (sum(current_actions) - 1) / (len(current_actions) - 1)

```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy begins with Cooperation to foster a sustainable environment.
- It adapts based on the current stock level and observed cooperation from peers, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.
- In the last round, it defects to maximize payoff, recognizing that future rounds are nonexistent.

This approach aims to optimize total payoffs by dynamically adjusting behavior in response to both resource levels and peer actions.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Cooperate:** Start by Cooperating to encourage collective sustainability and higher payoffs.
   - **Monitor and Retaliate:** Track opponents' actions. If a player defects, respond with defection in future rounds to deter further exploitation.
   - **Grace Periods:** Allow a period after defection before retaliating to incentivize cooperation resumption.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** Cooperate if the stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity). Defect below this threshold to secure remaining resources.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to build initial trust and encourage mutual benefits.
   - **Last Rounds:** Defect in final rounds to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds don't offer rewards.

3. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   - The strategy emphasizes mutual benefit by maintaining the resource pool while allowing necessary defections to prevent exploitation. It's designed to adapt to various opponent behaviors, promoting cooperation when beneficial and protecting against defection when needed.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```pseudocode
Function Strategy(player_index, history, current_stock):
    If current_round == 1:
        Return Cooperate
    Else:
        Check if any opponent defected in the last 'grace_period' rounds
        If yes:
            Return Defect
        Else:
            If current_stock > threshold (e.g., 0.75 * capacity):
                Return Cooperate
            Else:
                Return Defect
    End If

Handle last few rounds:
    If remaining_rounds <= grace_period + 1:
        Return Defect
```

This strategy balances cooperation with necessary defections, adapting dynamically to sustain the common pool resource while ensuring individual payoff maximization.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_287 = '''
The optimal strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances cooperation with defection based on several key factors: current stock levels, the number of remaining rounds, and the historical behavior of other players. Here's an organized approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Encourage a cooperative environment by setting a positive example, helping to maintain high stock levels.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels and Cooperation Rate:**
     - If the stock is above 70% of capacity and more than 80% of players are cooperating, continue to cooperate.
     - If the stock drops below 50%, or if less than 60% of players are cooperating in recent rounds, begin defecting more frequently.

3. **Later Rounds (Last 20%):**
   - **Action:** Increase defection rate.
   - **Rationale:** With fewer future rounds left, prioritize immediate gains. However, maintain some cooperation if the stock is still healthy to allow for sustained growth.

4. **Low Stock Situations:**
   - If the stock drops below 25%:
     - Consider a mix of cooperation and defection to prevent rapid depletion while trying to recover the stock.
     - Monitor others' actions; if many are defecting, defect as well but be prepared to switch back to cooperation if needed.

### Responsive Adjustments

- **Adaptation Based on Others' Actions:**
  - Track the proportion of cooperators. If a significant majority (80%) cooperate, continue cooperating.
  - If less than 60% cooperate, increase defection rate to avoid being exploited while others defect.

- **Dynamic Thresholds:**
  - Adjust cooperation and defection thresholds based on the number of remaining rounds and current stock health.
  - For instance, in later rounds with ample stock, prioritize higher defection rates for immediate gains.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase:**
   - Cooperate in the first few rounds to build a cooperative foundation.

2. **Cooperation Monitoring:**
   - Track the percentage of players defecting each round.
   - Use this data to decide whether to continue cooperating or start defecting.

3. **Adjustment Based on Stock:**
   - Maintain cooperation if stock is high and others are mostly cooperating.
   - Gradually increase defection as stock decreases or cooperation rates fall below a certain threshold.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - As rounds near completion, prioritize immediate gains through defection, but remain flexible based on remaining stock capacity.

### Summary

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on current conditions and others' behaviors. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and adapts to exploit or mitigate defection as needed.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_288 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing points while considering future rounds and opponents' actions, we propose a balanced approach that adapts based on the current game state and historical behavior. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to maintain a cooperative equilibrium.

2. **Mid-Game Adaptation**:
   - Monitor recent cooperation rates among other players.
   - Check if the current stock level is above a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity).
   - If both conditions are met (high cooperation and healthy stock), continue cooperating.
   - Otherwise, defect to either prevent exploitation or salvage remaining resources.

3. **End-Game Defection**: In the last few rounds, switch to always defecting to maximize immediate points since future rounds no longer influence decisions.

This strategy ensures a balance between maintaining resource sustainability and maximizing immediate gains, adapting dynamically to changing game conditions.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially, adapt based on cooperation rates and stock levels, defect near the end.}}

description_COLLECTIVE_289 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Altruism Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy, named **Adaptive Altruism**, is designed to foster cooperation while protecting against exploitation in the Common Pool Resource Game. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on previous rounds' outcomes.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to encourage others to do the same, promoting a sustainable stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If in the previous round, at least 70% of players Cooperated:
     - Cooperate (C) to maintain positive dynamics and promote long-term gains.
   - If fewer than 30% of players Cooperated in the previous round:
     - Defect (D) to prevent being exploited by those who are defecting.
   - For cases between 30% and 70%, adjust based on trends over multiple rounds.

### Edge Cases:

- **Last Round:**
  - If it's the last round, players might consider defects for higher immediate payoff. However, stick with the adaptive rule to maintain sustainability unless exploitation is evident.
  
- **Early Defectors:**
  - Monitor and adapt if a few start defecting; respond by defecting to protect against rapid depletion.

### Strategy Implementation:

The strategy adapts dynamically, rewarding cooperation when prevalent and defecting when necessary. This approach aims to maximize collective payoffs while preventing resource collapse by balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function decide_action(previous_rounds):
    if current_round == 1:
        return C
    else:
        cooperate_count = count of players who Cooperated in previous round
        total_players = n
        cooperation_rate = cooperate_count / total_players
        
        if cooperation_rate >= 0.7:
            return C
        elif cooperation_rate <= 0.3:
            return D
        else:
            # Consider trends or additional factors, e.g., recent changes in cooperation rate
            # For simplicity, continue Cooperating but monitor for future adaptation
            return C
```

### Conclusion:

Adaptive Altruism encourages a cooperative environment by starting positively and adapting based on others' actions. It promotes sustainability while protecting against exploitation, balancing immediate gains with long-term resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_290 = '''
To address the problem of sustainably managing a shared resource through cooperation or defection based on the current stock level, we propose a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

### Approach
The strategy is centered around observing the current stock level and making decisions based on whether it meets a predetermined threshold. The key decision points are:

1. **Decision Rule**: Cooperate if the current stock is at least 60% of the capacity; otherwise, defect.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - In the first round, start with cooperation since the stock begins at full capacity.
   - For the last round, apply the same decision rule to avoid overharvesting.

This approach ensures that cooperation continues when the resource is sufficiently abundant, promoting sustainability. If the stock falls below the threshold, defection is chosen to maximize immediate gains without further depleting an already strained resource.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(stock_level, capacity):
    threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    return 'Cooperate' if stock_level >= threshold else 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
- **Decision Rule**: The strategy uses a threshold of 60% of the capacity to determine whether to cooperate or defect. This threshold is chosen to maintain a buffer that allows for sustainable growth and prevents resource collapse.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
  - **First Round**: Cooperation is initiated as the stock starts at full capacity, which meets the threshold.
  - **Last Round**: The same decision rule applies, ensuring cooperation if the stock remains above the threshold, thus avoiding unnecessary depletion.

This strategy adaptively responds to changes in the resource level, encouraging sustainable practices while accounting for potential defection by others.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_291 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round based on the cooperation rate of other players and the current stock level, we can formulate a strategy as follows:

**Strategy:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Defect.

3. **Other Rounds:**
   - Calculate the moving average of the cooperation rate over recent rounds (e.g., the last 3-5 rounds).
   - If the current stock level is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), Cooperate to aid in rebuilding the stock.
   - Else if both the moving average cooperation rate exceeds a certain level (e.g., 60%) and the current stock level is above another threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect.

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation in the First Round:** This serves as an initial positive signal to encourage others to cooperate, fostering a cooperative environment from the start.
  
- **Defection in the Last Round:** Since there are no future rounds to consider, maximizing immediate payoff by defecting is optimal.

- **Moving Average Cooperation Rate:** Using a moving average smoothens out volatility in cooperation rates from round to round, leading to more stable and predictable decisions.

- **Critical Stock Threshold:** When the stock is critically low, prioritizing cooperation helps prevent further depletion and allows the resource to recover in subsequent rounds.

- **Balancing Cooperation and Stock Health:** By considering both cooperation levels and stock health, the strategy ensures that cooperation is maintained when conditions are favorable, thereby supporting sustainable resource management. Defecting occurs only when necessary, either due to insufficient cooperation from others or a stressed resource state.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation under healthy conditions and defecting when it becomes advantageous or necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_292 = '''
The proposed strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a Common Pool Resource Game. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin each round by Cooperating (C) to maintain or build the common stock, ensuring sustainable growth.

2. **Monitor Defection**: Track the number of players who Defect (D) in each round. This helps determine if cooperation is being maintained or if there's excessive defection.

3. **Adaptive Defection Threshold**:
   - If the number of Defectors exceeds a threshold (e.g., half the players), switch to defecting for a few rounds to reduce consumption and incentivize others to cooperate in future rounds by lowering their payoffs when they defect.
   - The threshold can be dynamically adjusted based on historical behavior and stock levels.

4. **Stock-Based Adjustment**:
   - If the current stock is below a safe level (e.g., 30% of capacity), increase cooperation efforts to allow the stock to recover, ensuring sustainable growth in subsequent rounds.

5. **Return to Cooperation**: After periods of high defection or when the stock recovers, revert to Cooperating to sustain the resource and maximize collective payoffs.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to start on a positive note.
   - **Last Round**: Consider Cooperating to end on a positive note, potentially encouraging others in future interactions, though defecting might be beneficial if exploiting others is possible without future consequences.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
for each round:
    if it's the first round:
        action = C
    else:
        count_defectors = number of D actions in last round

        safe_level = 0.3 * capacity  # Example threshold
        
        if current_stock < safe_level:
            action = C  # Cooperate to allow stock recovery
        elif count_defectors > (n / 2):
            action = D  # Defect to punish excessive defection
        else:
            action = C  # Continue Cooperating
            
    perform action and record payoff
```

### Summary

This strategy starts with cooperation, adapts based on the number of defectors and stock levels, and includes mechanisms to punish excessive defection while ensuring long-term sustainability. It aims to encourage mutual cooperation for collective benefit while being resilient to varying opponent behaviors.

The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game effectively balances between exploiting the resource when it is abundant and conserving it when it is scarce. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy adapts to both the current state of the stock and historical player behavior, switching between two modes: Exploitation and Conservation.

#### Modes:
1. **Exploitation Mode**: Activated when the stock is above 75% of capacity.
   - **Cooperate (C)** if fewer than 2/3 of other players Cooperated in previous rounds.
   - **Defect (D)** otherwise, exploiting others' cooperation for higher payoff.

2. **Conservation Mode**: Activated when the stock is below 50% of capacity.
   - Always **Cooperate (C)** to minimize consumption and allow the stock to recover.

#### Initialization
- For the first 1-2 rounds, default to Cooperate to encourage sustainability and build a cooperative environment.

#### Last Round Consideration
- In the final round, if in Exploit Mode and the stock is above 50%, consider Defecting for immediate gain without worrying about future depletions.

### Decision Rules Summary
- **Stock > 75% Capacity**: Exploit by Cooperating only if fewer than 2/3 of others have Cooperated; otherwise, Defect.
- **50% < Stock ≤ 75%**: Transition phase where behavior shifts based on stock trends and recent player actions.
- **Stock ≤ 50%**: Conserve by always Cooperating to rebuild the stock.

### Edge Cases Handling
- **First Rounds**: Default to Cooperate to foster cooperation and sustainable resource use.
- **Final Round**: If in Exploit Mode and stock is sufficient, Defect for higher payoff without future concerns.
- **Low Stock (≤50%)**: Always Cooperate to prevent further depletion and aid recovery.

This strategy dynamically adapts to the game's state and player behavior, promoting long-term sustainability while allowing exploitation when advantageous. It ensures a balance between individual gain and collective responsibility, making it robust against various opponent strategies.

description_COLLECTIVE_294 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with future sustainability in a repeated resource harvesting game, we propose a strategic approach based on observing the current stock level relative to a predetermined threshold. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Determine a Threshold (X):** Set X as 80% of the maximum capacity (C). This means if the current stock (S) is above 80% of C, it is sustainable enough to continue Cooperating.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If S ≥ X: Choose to Cooperate. This helps maintain the resource level for future rounds, ensuring continued harvesting.
   - If S < X: Choose to Defect. When the stock is below this threshold, defecting maximizes immediate payoff while acknowledging that the resource may not sustain high yields in subsequent rounds.

3. **Implementation:** Apply this rule in each round based on the current observed stock level. This strategy encourages sustainable practices when possible and adapts by maximizing short-term gains when the resource is depleted.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to Cooperate if the current stock is above 80% of capacity; otherwise, Defect.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S \geq 0.8C \text{ else Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_295 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation with strategic defection based on the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round:** Start by Cooperating to encourage others to maintain the resource.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Assess Cooperation Level:** Determine if most players Cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Stock Health Check:** Evaluate whether the current stock is above a sustainable threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
3. **Decision Making:**
   - **Cooperate** if there's high cooperation among others and the stock is healthy.
   - **Defect** if cooperation is low or the stock is critically low, to maximize immediate payoff before potential depletion.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initialization:**
   - In the first round, choose to Cooperate (C).

2. **For Each Subsequent Round:**
   a. **Calculate Previous Cooperation:** Determine the number of players who Cooperated in the previous round.
   b. **Check Stock Level:** Assess if the current stock is above a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
   c. **Decision Criteria:**
      - If most players (more than half) Cooperated and the stock is above the threshold, choose to Cooperate.
      - Otherwise, choose to Defect.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Consider Cooperating if the stock is still sufficient; otherwise, defect to maximize final payoff.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is critically low, prioritize Defection to secure higher immediate payoffs.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock, capacity):
    n = number_of_players()
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        prev_round_coops = count Cooperators in history[round_number-2]
        stock_threshold = capacity * 0.5  # Example threshold
        if (prev_round_coops > n/2) and (current_stock >= stock_threshold):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages sustainability and sets a positive precedent.
- **Adaptive Behavior:** Adjusts based on others' actions, promoting mutual cooperation or defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion.
- **Stock Management:** Aims to maintain the stock within a sustainable range to ensure long-term benefits while allowing for strategic defection when needed.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to other players' behaviors and the evolving state of the common pool resource.
'''

The optimal strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting based on others' behavior and current stock levels. Here's the structured approach:

2. **Middle Phase:**
   - **Monitor:**

     - **Reasoning:** Maximize immediate payoff with no future impact.

4. **Edge Cases:**

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_297 = '''
**Strategy Overview:**

The strategy is designed to adaptively balance cooperation and defection based on the observed state of the common pool resource. It starts with cooperation to encourage sustainability, monitors stock trends, and adjusts actions dynamically.

---

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to promote a sustainable start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the moving average of stock levels over the last k rounds (k=3).
   - If the moving average is above a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), Cooperate.
   - If below the threshold, Defect.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Choose to Cooperate or Defect based on which action yields a higher immediate payoff given the current stock level.

---

**Threshold and Parameters:**

- The threshold can be set dynamically as 70% of capacity, but may adjust based on game parameters like n (number of players) and r (number of rounds).
- Using a moving average over k=3 rounds helps smooth out fluctuations and prevent premature switching between cooperation and defection.

---

**Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to encourage others to do the same.
- **Last Round:** Maximize immediate payoff without regard for future consequences, as there are no subsequent rounds.

---

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decision_function(history, current_stock, capacity):
    n_rounds = len(history) + 1  # Including current round
    if n_rounds == 1:
        return 'C'  # First round cooperation

    # For middle rounds (not first or last)
    k = 3
    start_index = max(0, n_rounds - k - 1)
    recent_stocks = [state.stock for state in history[start_index:-1]]
    moving_avg = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)

    threshold = capacity * 0.7

    if moving_avg > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def last_round_decision(current_stock, n_players):
    # Calculate payoffs for C and D
    payoff_C = current_stock / (2 * n_players)
    payoff_D = current_stock / n_players
    return 'C' if payoff_C > payoff_D else 'D'
```

---

**Conclusion:**

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on observed stock trends, promoting sustainability while being responsive to changes in resource levels. It handles edge cases by starting with cooperation and maximizing immediate gains in the final round.

description_COLLECTIVE_298 = '''
To address the weaknesses in the Tithe and Share strategy, particularly its vulnerability to coordinated defections leading to irreversible resource depletion, a revised strategy is proposed. This enhanced approach integrates dynamic adjustments based on growth potential, incorporates memory of past behaviors, and includes mechanisms to encourage recovery from low-resource states.

**Revised Strategy: Dynamic Cooperation with Recovery Mechanisms**

1. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment Based on Growth Potential:**
   - Instead of using a fixed threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity), calculate the threshold dynamically by considering the potential growth of the resource given its current level.
   - For example, if the stock is low but has high growth potential due to the term \(1 - \frac{S}{C}\) in the growth function, players are more inclined to Cooperate to facilitate recovery.

2. **Memory of Past Behaviors:**
   - Maintain a moving average or weighted history of cooperation rates from previous rounds.
   - If a significant proportion of players have been Cooperating recently, continue to Cooperate; conversely, if there's a trend towards Defection, adjust the threshold accordingly to prevent rapid depletion.

3. **Gradual Response Mechanism:**
   - Instead of an abrupt switch from C to D when crossing the threshold, implement a probabilistic response where the likelihood of Cooperating decreases as the stock falls below the threshold but doesn't drop to zero immediately.
   - This creates a smoother transition and reduces the risk of sudden collapses in cooperation.

4. **Recovery Periods:**
   - After detecting a period of Defection that causes the stock to drop, implement a predetermined number of rounds where players Cooperate regardless of the current stock level (up to a maximum to prevent overconsumption).
   - This allows the resource time to recover without relying solely on others' cooperation.

5. **Majority Following with Hysteresis:**
   - Follow the majority action but incorporate hysteresis, meaning that once players switch to Defecting, they require a higher threshold of Cooperation in subsequent rounds before reverting back.
   - This prevents oscillations between C and D due to fluctuating majority actions.

6. **Exploration Phase with Risk Assessment:**
   - In the initial rounds, experiment with both C and D while monitoring the impact on resource levels and payoffs.
   - Use this phase to assess whether Defection is sustainable without causing long-term harm to the resource base.

**Implementation Steps:**

- **Step 1:** Begin each round by evaluating the current stock level \(S\) and calculating the dynamic threshold based on potential growth. This involves assessing how much the stock can recover given its current state.
  
- **Step 2:** Review the history of actions from previous rounds to determine recent trends in cooperation rates. Use this information to adjust the threshold dynamically, considering both past behaviors and current resource conditions.

- **Step 3:** Decide whether to Cooperate or Defect by comparing the current stock level against the dynamic threshold and considering the probabilistic response mechanism. This step may involve a weighted decision where Cooperation is favored if the stock is near or above the threshold, especially with high growth potential.

- **Step 4:** If the stock has recently been low but shows signs of recovery (e.g., increasing after several rounds of Cooperation), implement recovery periods to further rebuild the resource. During these periods, players prioritize Cooperation even if the current stock is slightly below the usual threshold.

- **Step 5:** Continuously monitor the impact of actions on the resource and adjust strategies accordingly. Use feedback from past rounds to refine thresholds and response probabilities, ensuring adaptability to changing conditions.

**Example Walkthrough:**

Suppose we have n=4 players, capacity C=100, starting with S=100.

- **Round 1:** All Cooperate (C). Stock remains sustainable.
  
- **Round 2:** One player defects (D). Stock drops but is still above the dynamic threshold. Players observe this and note the impact on growth.

- **Rounds 3-5:** Despite one defector, others continue to Cooperate because S remains high enough and shows potential for recovery. The dynamic threshold adjusts based on observed growth rates.

- **Round 6:** Two players defect. Stock drops below the dynamic threshold. Players now consider both the stock level and past cooperation trends.

- **Rounds 7-9:** Observing a trend towards Defection, some players revert to Cooperating to allow resource recovery. The majority following with hysteresis mechanism kicks in, encouraging others to join in rebuilding the stock.

- **Round 10 onwards:** Stock starts recovering due to increased Cooperation. Players adjust their strategies back to normal thresholds, ensuring sustainable use moving forward.

This revised strategy balances immediate gains from Defection with long-term sustainability by dynamically adapting to resource conditions and historical cooperation patterns, thereby enhancing resilience against coordinated defections and promoting overall system health.

description_COLLECTIVE_299 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we'll outline a strategy that balances immediate payoff maximization with the sustainability of the shared resource. The solution involves dynamic threshold adjustments based on recent stock trends and game progression.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Start by Cooperating in the initial rounds to build a stable foundation for the resource.
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust thresholds for low, medium, and high stock levels dynamically as the game progresses. This ensures that decisions adapt to changing conditions over time.
3. **Recent Trends Analysis**: Track recent stock levels to determine if the resource is increasing or decreasing, influencing whether to Cooperate or Defect.
4. **Endgame Handling**: In the final rounds, prioritize immediate payoff by defecting more, as future consequences are less significant.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number, total_rounds, capacity, n):
    # Initial parameters
    initial_coop = 3  # Cooperate in the first few rounds
    if round_number <= initial_coop:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent trends based on last 10 rounds of stock levels
    recent_stock = history[-10:] if len(history) >= 10 else history
    avg_stock = sum(recent_stock) / len(recent_stock) if recent_stock else capacity
    
    # Determine thresholds adjusted by game progress
    progress = round_number / total_rounds
    low_threshold = max(0.2 * capacity, 0.4 * capacity * (1 - progress))
    high_threshold = min(0.8 * capacity, 0.6 * capacity + 0.2 * capacity * (1 - progress))
    
    # Calculate growth trend over recent rounds
    if len(recent_stock) > 1:
        growth_trend = stock - recent_stock[-1]
    else:
        growth_trend = 0
    
    # Decide based on thresholds and trends
    if stock < low_threshold or avg_stock < low_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif stock > high_threshold and avg_stock > (high_threshold * 0.9):
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Compare expected payoffs
        payoff_C = stock / (2 * n)
        payoff_D = stock / n
        
        # Consider future rounds impact
        remaining_rounds = total_rounds - round_number
        if remaining_rounds == 0:
            future_weight = 0
        else:
            future_weight = 1 / remaining_rounds
        
        expected_payoff_C = payoff_C + (future_weight * 2)  # Higher weight for sustainability
        expected_payoff_D = payoff_D - (future_weight * 1)  # Penalize for potential depletion
        
        if expected_payoff_D > expected_payoff_C:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The first few rounds are dedicated to Cooperating to ensure the resource doesn't deplete immediately.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: As the game progresses, thresholds adjust to reflect the remaining rounds, ensuring decisions remain relevant to the current state of the game.
- **Recent Trends Analysis**: By examining recent stock levels, the strategy adapts to whether the resource is growing or shrinking, influencing the decision to Cooperate or Defect.
- **Endgame Handling**: In the final 20% of rounds, defecting becomes more favorable as future consequences are less impactful.

This approach efficiently balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring a competitive yet responsible strategy for managing shared resources.

**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Start with Cooperate (C) in the first round to encourage a sustainable stock level.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Observe the previous round's actions:
     - If more than 50% of players Cooperated, continue Cooperating.
     - If fewer than 30% Cooperated, switch to Defect (D) to signal disapproval and potentially punish Defectors.
   - Adjust thresholds based on stock dynamics. If the stock is below 60% of capacity, prioritize Cooperating to aid recovery.

3. **Final Rounds:**
   - In the last few rounds, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoffs since there's no future benefit from maintaining a higher stock.

4. **Stock-Based Adjustments:**
   - Monitor the current stock level:
     - If the stock is below 60% of capacity, prioritize Cooperating to help it regrow.
     - If the stock is high and stable (close to capacity), continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability.

**Summary of Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate.
- **Middle Rounds:**
  - Cooperate if >50% of players Cooperated last round.
  - Defect if <30% Cooperated, especially if the stock is declining.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Defect to maximize immediate payoffs.
- **Stock Thresholds:**
  - Cooperate if stock <60% to aid recovery.
  - Continue Cooperating at higher stock levels for sustainability.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on observed player behavior and current stock conditions, encouraging sustainable resource use while protecting against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_301 = '''
**Final Strategy Design for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
To sustainably manage the common pool resource while maximizing cumulative payoffs over multiple rounds by encouraging cooperation among players.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Justification: Establish a baseline of cooperation to encourage others to follow suit, promoting sustainable resource use.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Evaluate the following conditions:
     - **Condition A:** Percentage of Cooperators in the previous round exceeds 60%.
     - **Condition B:** Current stock level is above 60% of capacity.
   - Decision:
     - If both Condition A and Condition B are met: **Cooperate.**
     - If either condition is not met: **Defect.**
       - Justification: Defection signals to others that resource depletion is unacceptable, incentivizing future cooperation.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Evaluate the current stock level:
     - If the stock is above 60% of capacity: **Cooperate.**
     - If the stock is below or equal to 60%: **Defect.**
       - Justification: While defecting in the final round maximizes immediate payoff, defecting only when necessary helps maintain sustainability for potential future interactions (though the game ends here).

---

### **Edge Cases and Considerations:**

- **Stock Near Capacity:**
  - Continue Cooperating to preserve the resource's health.
  
- **Low Stock Levels:**
  - Defect to signal others of the urgency, aiming to reset cooperation in subsequent rounds.

- **Dynamic Adaptation:**
  - Adjust actions each round based on updated stock levels and cooperation rates from previous rounds.

---

### **Pseudocode Representation:**

```python
def decide_action(player_id, history, current_stock):
    # Initial Round (Round 1)
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Extract previous round's actions
    prev_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    num_cooperators = sum(1 for action in prev_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    cooperation_rate = num_cooperators / len(prev_actions)
    
    # Critical thresholds
    critical_stock = 0.6 * capacity
    critical_cooperation = 0.6
    
    # Current round conditions
    condition_a = cooperation_rate >= critical_cooperation
    condition_b = current_stock >= critical_stock
    
    # Last Round Check
    if len(history) == r - 1:
        return 'C' if current_stock > critical_stock else 'D'
    
    # Decision Logic for Middle Rounds
    if condition_a and condition_b:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

---

### **Rationale:**

- **Cooperation Promotion:** Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent, encouraging others to maintain sustainable practices.
  
- **Threshold-Based Adaptation:** Using cooperation rates and stock levels ensures the strategy is responsive to current conditions without requiring direct communication.

- **Defection as a Signal:** When resource depletion or low cooperation is detected, defecting serves as a collective signal to reset behavior, preventing long-term resource collapse.

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while promoting cooperative outcomes.

description_COLLECTIVE_302 = '''
To address the problem of encouraging cooperation in a resource management scenario, we propose a strategy that begins with cooperation and adapts based on the recent behavior of other players. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to promote sustainable use of the resource.

2. **Monitor Recent Behavior**: For each subsequent round, observe the actions of other players from the previous round.

3. **Majority Check**: Determine if more than half of the other players defected in the last round. If so, defect this round; otherwise, continue cooperating.

4. **Adapt and Reassess**: Continuously apply this rule to adapt your strategy based on others' recent actions, encouraging cooperation when prevalent and defecting only when widespread.

This approach aims to maintain cooperation unless a significant portion of players start exploiting the system, at which point it switches to defection to maximize individual gain while preventing resource depletion. The strategy balances between fostering sustainable practices and responding to potential exploitation.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate in the first round; defect if more than half of other players defected in the previous round, otherwise cooperate.}}$

description_COLLECTIVE_303 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability. This strategy is adaptive, robust, and designed to handle various opponent behaviors while promoting collective cooperation. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT)

1. **Initial Round:** Begin with Cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and encourage resource sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:** Implement a dynamic decision-making process based on the current stock level and historical behavior of other players.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
   - **Cooperate:** If the current stock is above a dynamically adjusted threshold.
   - **Defect:** If the current stock is below this threshold or if there's evidence of widespread defection by others.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Adjust the threshold based on past stock levels, consumption rates, and the proportion of Cooperators vs. Defectors observed in previous rounds.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Start with Cooperate.
   - **Last Round:** Consider defecting if the stock is low to maximize immediate gain without concern for future rounds.
   - **Mid Rounds:** Focus on maintaining or restoring the resource level through cooperation, defecting only when necessary.

### Decision Rules

- **Action Selection:**
  - If the current stock (S) > dynamic threshold (T): Cooperate.
  - Else: Defect.

- **Threshold Adjustment:**
  - Calculate T based on historical data and observed player behavior:
    - Increase T if previous rounds showed cooperation leading to resource replenishment.
    - Decrease T if defection was prevalent, indicating the need for a more conservative approach.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, n, capacity):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate dynamic threshold based on history and current state
    past_coops = sum(1 for h in history if h['action'] == 'C')
    total_rounds = len(history)
    coop_ratio = past_coops / total_rounds if total_rounds > 0 else 1.0
    
    # Base threshold as a fraction of capacity
    base_threshold = capacity * 0.75  # Can be adjusted based on empirical testing
    adjusted_threshold = max(base_threshold, current_stock - (n * 2))  # Prevents negative thresholds

    # If most players are Cooperating, raise the threshold; else lower it
    if coop_ratio > 0.6:
        adjusted_threshold = min(adjusted_threshold + capacity*0.1, capacity)
    else:
        adjusted_threshold = max(adjusted_threshold - capacity*0.1, 0)
    
    # Decision based on current stock and adjusted threshold
    if current_stock >= adjusted_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Strategy Explanation

- **Cooperation Initiation:** Starting with Cooperate sets a positive precedent, encouraging others to follow suit, which helps in maintaining the resource for future rounds.

- **Threshold Adaptation:** The threshold is dynamically adjusted based on past interactions. If cooperation has been successful, the threshold is raised, promoting continued cooperation. Conversely, if defection is prevalent, the threshold is lowered to allow for more cautious decision-making.

- **Defection as a Last Resort:** Defecting is reserved for situations where the resource is critically low or when others are defecting excessively, preventing individual exploitation and maximizing immediate gains when necessary.

This strategy ensures adaptability, promotes collective cooperation while being resilient against defectors, making it robust across various game scenarios.

description_COLLECTIVE_304 = '''
To address the problem of determining a cooperative strategy in a repeated game with perfect information, we propose an adaptive approach that considers both the cooperation rate among players and the health of the shared resource. This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on observed behavior and resource levels.

### Strategy Steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set thresholds: 60% for Cooperators, 70% for Stock (relative to initial capacity).
   - Define a lookback window of the last 3 rounds.
   - Identify the final two rounds as critical periods for adjusting strategy.

2. **Round 1**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate
     - Justification: Encourages sustainability and sets a positive example.

3. **For Rounds 2 to (r - 2)**:
   - **Step 1**: Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the last 3 rounds.
   - **Step 2**: Compute the average stock level over these same 3 rounds.
   - **Decision**:
     - If both the cooperation rate is ≥60% and the average stock is ≥70%, **Cooperate**.
     - Else, **Defect** to maximize immediate payoff or prevent resource collapse.

4. **For Last Two Rounds (r - 1 and r)**:
   - **Round (r - 1)**:
     - If the average stock level in the last round was ≥80%, **Cooperate** to preserve the resource for the final round.
     - Else, **Defect** to exploit remaining resources.
   - **Round r**:
     - **Action**: Defect
       - Justification: Maximizes immediate payoff with no future rounds affected.

### Explanation:

- **Initial Round Cooperation**: Starts positive to encourage others and maintain resource levels.
- **Dynamic Adaptation (Rounds 2 to penultimate)**: Adjusts actions based on recent cooperation rates and stock health, promoting stability when conditions are favorable and defecting when necessary.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment**: Balances between preserving resources in the penultimate round for a potential higher payoff in the last round, while ensuring maximum gain in the final move without concern for future rounds.

This strategy is robust against varying player behaviors and resource dynamics, aiming to achieve a collectively optimal outcome through informed adaptability.

  - Cooperate to encourage others and establish a sustainable resource base.

- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  1. Calculate the proportion of opponents who Cooperated in the previous round:
     - \( p = \frac{\text{Number of Cooperators}}{\text{n - 1}} \)
  2. Determine thresholds based on current stock level (\( S \)):
     - If \( S > 70\% \) of capacity, set a lower cooperation threshold (e.g., 50%).
     - Else, set a higher cooperation threshold (e.g., 60%).
  3. Decision:
     - If \( p \geq \text{threshold} \), Cooperate.
     - Else, Defect.

---

### **2. Stock Consideration**

- Track the stock level and adjust thresholds accordingly:
  - If the stock has been consistently high (e.g., above 70%), encourage more Cooperating by lowering the threshold.
  - If the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 50%), prioritize Cooperating to prevent collapse.

---

### **3. Edge Cases Handling**

- **Last Round:**
  - Defect, as there are no future rounds to consider.
  
- **Near Last Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds):**
  - Shift towards defecting unless the stock is very high and can sustain it without significant drop.

---

### **4. Learning Mechanism**

- After each round, analyze how decisions affected future stock levels:
  - If Cooperating when \( p \) was above threshold maintained or increased the stock, keep the same threshold.
  - If Cooperating when \( p \) was below threshold caused drops, lower the cooperation threshold for next time.

---

### **5. Implementation Notes**

- Use a moving average of past cooperation rates over the last k rounds (e.g., k=5) to smooth out fluctuations.
- Adjust thresholds dynamically based on observed trends in stock levels and opponent behavior.

---

### **6. Objective**

ACOB aims to maximize long-term payoffs by balancing individual exploitation with collective sustainability, adapting to changing conditions through dynamic decision-making based on opponents' behavior and resource levels.

---

**Note:** This strategy requires careful tuning of thresholds and may need adjustments based on specific game parameters (e.g., number of players, rounds) for optimal performance.

**Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 3-5 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Build a positive stock base and set a precedent for cooperation.

2. **Middle Rounds (After Initial Phase Until Last Few Rounds):**
   - **Dynamic Thresholds:**
     - **High Threshold (HT):** 80% of capacity.
     - **Low Threshold (LT):** 60% of capacity.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If current stock > HT: Cooperate.
     - If current stock < LT: Defect.
     - Between HT and LT:
       - Calculate average cooperation rate from previous rounds.
       - If average cooperation rate > 70%, Cooperate; else, Defect.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 3-5 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Tend towards Defecting (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff as future rounds have no impact.

4. **Adjustment of Thresholds:**
   - Dynamically adjust HT and LT each round based on observed stock trends:
     - If stock consistently above previous levels, increase HT.
     - If stock consistently below, decrease HT and lower LT.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate positive dynamics.
   - **Stock Collapse (stock near 0):** Defect to salvage immediate payoff.

6. **Implementation Approach:**
   - Use a state machine with conditional checks on stock levels, thresholds, and historical cooperation rates.
   - Adjust thresholds adaptively each round based on observed trends.

This strategy balances exploration in initial rounds, exploitation towards the end, and adapts dynamically to maintain sustainable stock levels while responding to opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_307 = '''
The optimal strategy for balancing cooperation with necessary defection, while maintaining resource sustainability, is as follows:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, Cooperate to establish a cooperative environment and maximize growth potential.

2. **Dynamic Thresholds Based on Stock Level:**
   - Divide the stock level into three zones:
     - **High Zone (S > 0.75 * capacity):** Cooperate to maintain sustainable consumption.
     - **Medium Zone (0.25 * capacity ≤ S ≤ 0.75 * capacity):** Use a mixed strategy with the probability of Cooperating, p = (S / capacity) * 0.8 + 0.2. This adjusts cooperation based on the stock level, encouraging more cooperation when resources are ample.
     - **Low Zone (S < 0.25 * capacity):** Defect unless over 75% of other players Cooperated in the last round, in which case Cooperate to foster recovery.

3. **Adaptation Based on Historical Cooperation:**
   - Track the average cooperation rate over the past m rounds (e.g., m=5).
   - If this rate is above a threshold (e.g., 70%), increase the tendency to Cooperate by adjusting p upwards.
   - If below a threshold (e.g., 30%), decrease cooperation, possibly forcing Defection in the medium zone.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - In the last round, consider defecting if S > 50% of capacity to maximize immediate payoff with no future consequences.
   - After significant stock drops, be cautious, leaning towards Defection until cooperation recovers.

This strategy encourages sustainable cooperation while adapting to resource levels and historical behavior, preventing over-depletion without relying on specific coordination. It balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, fostering a resilient approach against varying player strategies.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&1. \text{ Cooperate in the first round.} \\
&2. \text{ Use dynamic thresholds based on stock level:} \\
&&- \text{ High zone (S > 0.75C): Cooperate.} \\
&&- \text{ Medium zone (0.25C ≤ S ≤ 0.75C): Cooperate with probability p = (S/C) * 0.8 + 0.2.} \\
&&- \text{ Low zone (S < 0.25C): Defect unless >75% Cooperated last round.} \\
&3. \text{ Adapt cooperation rate based on historical behavior: Adjust p if average cooperation over past rounds is above/below thresholds.} \\
&4. \text{ Handle edge cases, e.g., defect in last round if S > 0.5C.}

To address the problem, we propose a strategic approach where each player begins by cooperating and continues to do so based on two conditions: the health of the resource (stock level) and the proportion of cooperators in previous rounds. If these conditions are not met, players defect, signaling others to cooperate more.

### Approach
1. **First Round**: All players start by cooperating.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Each player checks the stock level at the beginning of the previous round. If it was above 70% of capacity and more than half of the players cooperated in that round, they cooperate again.
   - Otherwise, they defect.

This strategy aims to maintain a healthy resource by encouraging cooperation when conditions are favorable and signaling others to adjust their behavior if they aren't.

### Solution Code
```python
def decision(history):
    # history is a list where each element is a tuple (s_prev, c_last)
    if not history:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    s_prev, c_last = history[-1]
    n_players = len(history[0][1]) if history else 1
    capacity = max(s for s, _ in history) if history else 100

    # Check conditions: stock above 70% and more than half cooperated last round
    if s_prev > 0.7 * capacity and c_last > n_players / 2:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The game starts with all players cooperating to encourage others to follow suit.
- **Stock Health Check**: Players monitor the resource's health, ensuring it stays above 70% of its capacity. This threshold ensures sustainability.
- **Cooperation Incentive**: By requiring more than half of players to cooperate in the previous round, players incentivize each other to maintain cooperative behavior for long-term benefits.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability by encouraging cooperation and signaling when changes are needed, preventing over-depletion and fostering a stable cooperative environment.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_309 = '''
**Final Answer**

The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining sustainability. It adapts based on others' actions and the resource's state, balancing cooperation with defecting when necessary.

1. **Initial Phase:**
   - Cooperate in the first few rounds to encourage sustainability.
   - Observe consumption patterns to assess others' strategies.

2. **Monitoring Indicators:**
   a. Average cooperation rate over recent rounds (last 3-5 rounds).
   b. Current stock level relative to capacity and optimal growth point (~capacity/2).

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - If average cooperation rate is above 70% and the stock is above 40% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
   - If cooperation rate drops below 70% or stock falls below 40% of capacity, switch to Defecting.

4. **Adaptation:**
   - Reassess indicators every round and adjust strategy based on new data.
   - In the last 10% of rounds, consider defecting more for higher immediate payoffs.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - First Round: Cooperate unconditionally.
   - Last Round(s): Consider defecting if it leads to a higher immediate payoff.

This approach balances sustainability with adaptability, ensuring long-term gains while protecting against resource depletion.

description_COLLECTIVE_310 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation with strategic defection to optimize long-term payoffs. Here's a structured overview of the approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Conditional Defection

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same and sustain the common pool.

2. **Stock Threshold for Defection**:
   - Calculate a defection threshold based on current stock (S), number of players (n), and capacity.
   - The threshold is set at `(capacity / n) * 0.8`, encouraging defection only when the stock can sustain it without rapid depletion.

3. **Defection Decision**: Defect if:
   - Current stock (S) > threshold.
   - Proportion of past defections by other players < 30%, indicating cooperation is still prevalent.

4. **Cooperation Adjustment**: If the proportion of past defections exceeds 30%, revert to cooperation to prevent over-depletion and promote sustainability.

5. **Endgame Consideration**: In the last 10% of rounds, switch to cooperation to preserve remaining stock, ensuring it can sustain through the final rounds without sudden depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, n_players, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate defection threshold
    threshold = (capacity / n_players) * 0.8
    
    # Determine past defection rate
    past_defections = sum(1 for action in history['other_actions'] if action == 'D') / len(history['other_actions'])
    
    # Check endgame condition
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        return 'C'
    
    # Decide based on threshold and past behavior
    if current_stock > threshold and past_defections < 0.3:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts with cooperation to foster a cooperative environment.
- **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold ensures defection only when the stock is sufficiently high, preventing rapid depletion.
- **Defection Decision**: Defecting is conditional on both stock levels and past behavior, aiming to exploit without encouraging widespread defection.
- **Adjustment for Past Behavior**: If others defect frequently, reverting to cooperation helps sustain the resource.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Switching to cooperation in later rounds preserves the stock, preventing a sudden drop that could reduce payoffs in final rounds.

This approach adaptively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, aiming to maximize cumulative payoff while encouraging cooperative behavior from others.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_311 = '''
To address the problem, we need to design an individual player's strategy for maximizing their gains in a common resource game without communication or enforcement mechanisms. The goal is to balance cooperation with defection based on the current state of the resource.

### Approach
The approach involves using a threshold-based strategy where cooperation and defection decisions are made based on the current stock level relative to a target (capacity/2). This target represents an optimal point for sustainable growth. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Target Stock Level**: Set at capacity/2, as this is where regrowth is maximized.
2. **Decision Rule**:
   - If the current stock is above the target, Cooperate to allow regrowth and maintain sustainability.
   - If the current stock is below the target, Defect to maximize immediate gains before potential collapse.

This strategy aims to sustain cooperation when possible while allowing defection as a reactive measure if cooperation isn't maintained by others.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_stock, capacity):
    target = capacity / 2
    if current_stock > target:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"
```

### Explanation
- **Target Stock Level**: The threshold is set at half the total resource capacity. This level is chosen because it balances the need for sufficient resources to sustain growth while allowing room for some depletion.
- **Decision Making**:
  - When `current_stock` exceeds the target, cooperation ensures that resources are preserved and can regrow, benefiting all players in the long term.
  - If `current_stock` falls below the target, defecting allows the player to maximize their immediate gain, recognizing that others may not be cooperating.

This strategy is a balance between long-term sustainability and short-term gains. It assumes that if cooperation isn't maintained by others, defecting can prevent further depletion leading to potential collapse.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_312 = '''
The decision rule for each player is as follows:

- **Cooperate** if the product of (current stock / capacity) and (remaining rounds / total rounds) exceeds 0.5.
- Otherwise, **Defect**.

This strategy ensures that players maintain cooperation when resources are abundant and time allows for future gains, while defecting when sustainability is threatened or in the final rounds to maximize immediate payoff.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if }(S/\text{capacity}) \times (R/r) > 0.5\text{; otherwise, Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_313 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can outline an adaptive and sustainable approach that balances immediate gains with long-term resource preservation. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

1. **Initial Cooperative Stance**:
   - Begin with cooperation in the first few rounds to maximize initial stock growth and set a positive precedent.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**:
   - Establish an adaptive threshold that determines when to switch from cooperation to defection.
   - The threshold starts at a high value, typically near the capacity, and decreases dynamically based on game progress and resource depletion.

3. **Threshold Adjustment Mechanism**:
   - **Time Decay**: Gradually lower the threshold as rounds progress to account for diminishing future gains.
   - **Stock Health Check**: Monitor the stock's health (e.g., growth rate) and adjust the threshold if it shows signs of significant depletion or poor regeneration.
   - **Behavioral Inference**: Use observed consumption patterns from past rounds to estimate collective cooperation levels. If the stock is depleting faster than expected, lower the threshold to encourage more defection.

4. **Defection in Later Rounds**:
   - As the game approaches its final rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds), increase the likelihood of defecting to prioritize immediate payoffs over future sustainability.

5. **Feedback Loop for Sustainability**:
   - Continuously assess whether cooperation efforts are maintaining or depleting the stock.
   - If the stock is not replenishing as expected, adjust the strategy to defect more frequently to prevent collapse.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_threshold_cooperation(player_id, history, parameters):
    n = parameters['n']
    r = parameters['r']
    capacity = parameters['capacity']
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    
    # Determine remaining rounds and calculate time decay factor
    remaining_rounds = r - current_round + 1
    time_decay = max(0.5, (remaining_rounds / r))  # Prevents threshold from dropping too low
    
    # Calculate initial threshold based on capacity and cooperation incentive
    base_threshold = capacity * 0.75  # Adjust as needed based on empirical testing
    adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * time_decay
    
    # Assess stock health and adjust threshold
    if current_round > 1:
        previous_stock = history[current_round - 2]['stock']
        current_stock = history[current_round - 1]['stock']
        
        # Estimate expected growth under different scenarios
        expected_growth_coop = calculate_expected_growth(previous_stock, n, capacity,coop_ratio=0.8)
        expected_growth_defect = calculate_expected_growth(previous_stock, n, capacity, coop_ratio=0.2)
        
        actual_growth = current_stock - (previous_stock - total_consumption)
        
        # If growth is lower than expected under cooperation, infer higher defection
        if actual_growth < expected_growth_coop * 0.8:
            adjusted_threshold *= 0.9
    
    # Decision rule based on current stock and threshold
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock'] if history else capacity
    if current_round <= r - (r // 5):  # Avoid early collapse by maintaining higher threshold
        if current_stock > adjusted_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # In later rounds, prioritize immediate gain
        return 'D'

def calculate_expected_growth(s_remaining, n, capacity, coop_ratio=0.5):
    total_consumption = (n * coop_ratio) * (s_remaining / (2*n)) + (n * (1 - coop_ratio)) * (s_remaining / n)
    s_after = s_remaining - total_consumption
    growth = 2 * s_after * (1 - s_after / capacity)
    return max(growth, 0)
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to foster resource sustainability and encourage others to do the same.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: By adjusting thresholds based on time decay and observed stock behavior, the strategy adapts to changing conditions and collective actions.
- **Defection in Later Rounds**: Recognizing that future gains diminish as rounds progress, the strategy shifts towards defection in the final stages to maximize immediate payoffs.

This approach ensures a balance between individual gain and collective resource preservation, making it robust against diverse opponent behaviors while remaining adaptable to various game conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_314 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to current stock levels, historical trends, and the number of rounds remaining. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - **Threshold Initialization:** Set an initial cooperation threshold at 80% of the capacity (e.g., `threshold = 0.8 * capacity`).
   - **Historical Tracking:** Maintain records of past stock levels and actions to inform future decisions.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - **Adjust Based on Outcomes:** After each round, analyze how cooperation affected stock growth. If cooperation led to higher stock, consider raising the threshold slightly for future rounds.
   - **Lower Threshold if Necessary:** If cooperation did not prevent stock decline, lower the threshold to encourage more defection in subsequent rounds.

3. **Decision Making Per Round:**
   - **Current Stock Check:** Compare the current stock level (`S`) with the dynamically adjusted threshold.
     - **Cooperate (C):** If `S > threshold`, choose cooperation to preserve the resource.
     - **Defect (D):** If `S ≤ threshold`, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

4. **Endgame Consideration:**
   - **Round Progress:** As rounds progress towards the total number of rounds (`r`), gradually increase the tendency to defect, especially in the last few rounds when future payoffs are less significant.
   - **Final Rounds Adjustment:** In the final 10% of rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds out of 50), prioritize defection to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future depletion.

5. **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
initialize threshold = 0.8 * capacity
historical_stock = [capacity]  # Initialize with starting stock

for round in range(r):
    current_stock = historical_stock[-1]
    
    if round >= r - (r // 10):  # Last 10% of rounds
        action = D
    else:
        if current_stock > threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    
    # Simulate the round and update stock for next iteration
    # (This part is illustrative; actual game mechanics handle stock)
    
    historical_stock.append(new_stock)
    adjust_threshold(threshold, historical_stock)

def adjust_threshold(threshold, historical_stock):
    # Example adjustment based on past trends
    if len(historical_stock) > 2:
        last_two = historical_stock[-2:]
        if last_two[1] > last_two[0]:
            threshold *= 1.05  # Increase threshold slightly
        else:
            threshold *= 0.95  # Decrease threshold slightly
    return threshold
```

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation Threshold:** The threshold ensures cooperation when resources are abundant, promoting sustainability.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Adapting the threshold based on past outcomes allows the strategy to respond to changing conditions, ensuring it remains effective even as player behaviors evolve.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Recognizing that later rounds have fewer future implications encourages players to defect more, maximizing their payoff without worrying about long-term consequences.

This strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors, as it adapts dynamically and doesn't rely on coordination with others. It balances immediate gains with the need for sustainable resource management over multiple rounds.

**Strategy: Adaptive Conservation with Threshold-Based Defection**

1. **Initial Rounds (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to preserve the high initial stock level.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - The current stock is above 75% of capacity.
     - Recent trends indicate stable or increasing stock levels.
   - **Defect** if:
     - The current stock is below 25% of capacity.
     - Recent stock levels are decreasing significantly (e.g., a negative trend over the last few rounds).

3. **Late Rounds (Last 2 Rounds):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the stock is zero, always defect.
   - In the final round, defect regardless of other factors.

    recent_stock = [s for s in history[-window_size:]]
    if len(recent_stock) > 1:
        average_change = (recent_stock[-1] - recent_stock[0]) / len(recent_stock)

    if stock > high_threshold and average_change >= 0:
        return 'C'
    elif stock < low_threshold or (average_change < -some_negative_value):

            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Cooperation:** Preserves the stock for future rounds when it's abundant.
- **Defection:** Maximizes immediate gain when the stock is low or rapidly decreasing, preventing long-term losses from over-depletion.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Adjusts based on current and recent stock levels to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

This strategy effectively navigates the trade-offs between individual gain and collective resource preservation, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios without relying on coordination mechanisms.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by promoting sustainability and setting a positive example.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Check:**
     - If current stock > 80% of capacity:
       - Action: Cooperate (C)
       - Rationale: High stock allows sustainable consumption.
     - If 60% ≤ stock ≤ 80% of capacity:
       - Action: Cooperate (C) but monitor others' actions.
       - Rationale: Moderate stock; balance between sustainability and potential adaptation.
     - If stock < 60% of capacity:
       - Action: Defect (D)
       - Rationale: Low stock indicates overuse, prioritize immediate payoff.

3. **Adaptation Based on Previous Round's Actions:**
   - After each round, count the number of players who Defected.
   - If >50% Defected in the last round:
     - Action: Switch to Defect (D) for next rounds until stock recovers or cooperation resumes.
     - Rationale: Detect shift towards depletion; adapt to maximize payoff.

4. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** No future benefit from preservation; take maximum possible payoff.

**Rationale:**
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It adapts dynamically based on stock levels and the behavior of other players, ensuring robustness against varying opponent strategies while promoting collective resource management when possible.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_317 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining cooperation in the face of potential defection while preserving the resource, a strategic approach based on monitoring the stock level relative to its capacity is proposed. The strategy involves two key thresholds: one for initiating cooperation and another for defecting when the resource shows signs of significant depletion.

**Strategy Explanation:**

1. **Threshold Setup:**
   - **Upper Threshold (75% of Capacity):** If the current stock is above this level, players should Cooperate. This indicates that the resource is healthy and sustainable, encouraging continued cooperation to maintain stability.
   
   - **Lower Threshold (50% of Capacity):** If the stock drops below this level, it suggests significant defection or overuse, prompting players to Defect. This action aims to maximize immediate gains while protecting against further depletion.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Players continuously monitor the stock level and its trend over recent rounds.
   - If the stock falls below 75%, players switch to Cooperating only if they observe signs of recovery or stable levels, indicating others are also cooperating.
   - Conversely, if the stock consistently remains below 75% despite cooperation attempts, players may adjust their strategy to defect more aggressively.

3. **Incentive Alignment:**
   - By setting these thresholds, the strategy aligns individual actions with collective sustainability. Cooperation is incentivized when the resource is healthy, while defection is reserved for times of significant stress, preventing complete collapse and encouraging others to cooperate.

**Conclusion:**

The proposed strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by using clear thresholds based on stock levels. It encourages cooperation during stable periods and adapts to potential collapses by allowing defection when necessary. This approach aims to maintain resource health while accounting for rational individual decision-making.

**Final Answer:**

Players should Cooperate if the current stock is above 75% of capacity, signaling a healthy resource that can sustain everyone's efforts. If the stock drops below 50%, players switch to Defecting to maximize their immediate gains and respond to potential overuse by others. This strategy balances cooperation with adaptability, encouraging sustainability while addressing inevitable defection risks.

To address the problem of designing a robust strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on the game's dynamic state. The strategy aims to maximize long-term payoffs by preserving the common pool resource while adapting to others' behaviors.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with cooperation in the first round to foster a sustainable resource level.
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Use thresholds that adjust based on remaining rounds and current stock levels:
   - Higher threshold when many rounds remain, encouraging sustainability.
   - Lower threshold as the game progresses, allowing for more defection if necessary.
3. **Stock Monitoring**: Track the stock trend over recent rounds to decide actions:
   - Cooperate if the stock is stable or increasing.
   - Defect if the stock is decreasing significantly.
4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - In early rounds, prioritize cooperation to build a sustainable resource.
   - In later rounds, be more willing to defect if the stock is low.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, remaining_rounds, capacity):
    # Determine thresholds based on remaining rounds
    if remaining_rounds > r / 2:
        threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
        threshold_low = 0.3 * capacity
    else:
        threshold_high = 0.7 * capacity
        threshold_low = 0.2 * capacity

    if current_stock >= threshold_high:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock <= threshold_low:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate trend based on historical data (simplified)
        trend = calculate_trend()
        if trend in ['increasing', 'stable']:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

def calculate_trend():
    # Simplified example: check last two rounds
    if stock_history[-1] > stock_history[-2]:
        return 'increasing'
    elif stock_history[-1] == stock_history[-2]:
        return 'stable'
    else:
        return 'decreasing'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by cooperating to build a sustainable resource base.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: By adjusting thresholds based on remaining rounds, the strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains. Higher thresholds when many rounds remain encourage cooperation for sustainability, while lower thresholds in later rounds allow more defection if necessary.
- **Stock Monitoring**: The strategy monitors stock trends to decide actions dynamically. If the stock is stable or increasing, it continues cooperating; if decreasing, it switches to defecting.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: In early rounds, cooperation is prioritized to build a sustainable resource. As rounds progress, especially in later stages, the strategy becomes more willing to defect if the stock is low.

This approach ensures that the strategy adapts effectively to different game states, balancing between maintaining sustainability and maximizing immediate gains when necessary.

description_COLLECTIVE_319 = '''
**Strategy Name**: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

**Objective**: Maximize individual payoffs while maintaining sustainable use of the common pool resource through adaptive cooperation and defection based on current stock levels and historical cooperation rates.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start and signal willingness to maintain mutual benefits.
2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity (0.8 * capacity), Cooperate to preserve resource sustainability.
   - If the current stock is below 20% of capacity (0.2 * capacity), Defect to maximize immediate payoff before potential collapse.
   - For stock levels between 20% and 80%:
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate (`avg_coop`) from previous rounds across all players.
     - If `avg_coop` > 70%, Cooperate, as others are maintaining a cooperative stance.
     - If `avg_coop` < 30%, Defect, as widespread defection indicates exploitation is occurring.
     - Otherwise (30% ≤ avg_coop ≤ 70%), default to Cooperate to encourage continued sustainability.
3. **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds for resource recovery.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to set a cooperative precedent and maintain high initial stock levels.
- **Last Round**: Always Defect to capitalize on the remaining stock without concern for future depletion.
- **Stock at Thresholds (0.8* or 0.2*capacity)**: 
  - If stock ≥ 0.8 * capacity, Cooperate.
  - If stock < 0.2 * capacity, Defect.

---

### **Collective Mindset Alignment**

ATC aligns with a collective mindset by initially promoting cooperation to sustain the resource. It adaptively adjusts based on others' behaviors, aiming for mutual benefit while protecting against exploitation. The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging other players to Cooperate through reciprocal actions.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, current_round, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players  # Given parameter
    capacity = given_capacity  # Given parameter
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if stock >= 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif stock < 0.2 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Calculate average cooperation rate from history
            avg_coop = calculate_avg_cooperation(history)
            if avg_coop > 0.7:
                return 'C'
            elif avg_coop < 0.3:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'

def calculate_avg_cooperation(history):
    # Calculate the average proportion of Cooperators in previous rounds
    total_coop = 0
    total_actions = 0
    for round_data in history:
       coop_count = sum(1 for action in round_data if action == 'C')
        total_coop += coop_count
        total_actions += len(round_data)
    if total_actions == 0:
        return 1.0  # Default to Cooperate if no history
    avg_coop = total_coop / (total_actions * n)  # Assuming each round has n actions
    return avg_coop
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts by Cooperating to maintain high stock levels and encourage others to do the same.
- **Threshold-Based Decisions**: Uses fixed thresholds (80% and 20%) of capacity to determine when to Cooperate or Defect based on current resource availability.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Adjusts decisions in middle rounds based on historical cooperation rates, promoting mutual sustainability when others Cooperate and defecting when exploitation is prevalent.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while encouraging collective resource preservation.

The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Memory (ATTM) strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation while adapting to others' behaviors and the state of the resource. Here's a structured summary of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Memory (ATTM)

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to maintain a high stock level for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the cooperation rate of other players in the previous round.
   - Use this rate to decide your action:
     - If the cooperation rate is above an 80% threshold, cooperate.
     - Below this threshold, defect to retaliate or protect against resource depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Consider defecting to maximize immediate payoff, but balance with potential collective outcomes if cooperation yields higher total payoffs.

4. **Stock Level Adjustment:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If the stock is below 50% of capacity, consider defecting more frequently to exploit remaining resources before depletion.

### Decision Rules:

- **Cooperation Threshold (80%):** Encourages maintaining cooperation when prevalent among others.
- **Memory Mechanism:** Retaliates against past defections to incentivize future cooperation.
- **Stock Level Consideration:** Adjusts behavior based on resource health, promoting caution or exploitation as needed.

### Edge Cases and Considerations:

- **First Round:** No history; cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Round:** Balance between defecting for immediate gain and cooperating if collective benefits outweigh short-term gains.
- **Stock Health:** Low stock levels trigger more cautious or aggressive behaviors, depending on sustainability needs versus exploitation opportunities.

### Implementation Summary:

The ATTM strategy dynamically adapts based on historical cooperation rates and current resource conditions. It promotes cooperation when others do so, defects to punish defectors, and adjusts behavior in response to the stock level. This balance helps sustain cooperation while defending against exploitation, making it robust for a variety of opponent behaviors.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock):
    if history is None:
        return 'C'  # First round
    
    other_cooperations = count(history['other_actions'], 'C')
    n_players = len(history['other_actions']) + 1
    cooperation_rate = other_cooperations / n_players

    if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
        threshold = 0.7
    else:
        threshold = 0.8
    
    if cooperation_rate > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def get_action(round_number, history=None, stock_level=capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return decide_action(None, capacity)
    else:
        return decide_action(history, stock_level)
```

This strategy ensures adaptability and robustness in a dynamic game setting, encouraging cooperation while protecting against resource depletion through defection when necessary.

description_COLLECTIVE_321 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation and defection based on current stock levels and historical trends. This approach ensures adaptability to various opponent behaviors while maintaining robustness.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set an initial Cooperation Threshold (CT) at 70% of the capacity.
   - Define a period for the last few rounds, where defection is prioritized.

2. **Decision Rules per Round:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to maintain a high stock level and encourage sustainability.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Defect to maximize immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.
   - **Intermediate Rounds:** Use CT to decide between cooperation or defection based on the current stock.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment of CT:**
   - Adjust CT after each round based on whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable relative to historical trends.
   - Lower CT if the stock decreases significantly, prompting more defection.
   - Maintain or slightly increase CT if the stock remains stable or grows, encouraging continued cooperation.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
Initialize:
    n = number of players
    r = number of rounds
    capacity = maximum sustainable stock level
    last_few_rounds = max(1, floor(r / 5))  # Adjust as needed

    CT = 0.7 * capacity
    recent_stock_history = deque(maxlen=5)  # Track past few stock levels
    recent_consumption_history = deque(maxlen=5)  # Track total consumption per round

For each round t in 1 to r:
    S = current_stock()
    
    if t == 1:
        action = 'C'
    elif t > (r - last_few_rounds):
        action = 'D'
    else:
        if S > CT:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'
    
    # Record action and update histories
    recent_stock_history.append(S)
    # After all players have acted, record total consumption for this round
    # Note: This would be done in the game's processing after actions are chosen
    
After each round:
    if t > 1:  # Exclude first round as there was no prior history
        # Update CT based on recent trends
        avg_stock = mean(recent_stock_history)
        total_consumption = sum(recent_consumption_history)
        
        if len(recent_stock_history) >=2 and S < recent_stock_history[-2]:
            # Stock decreased compared to previous round
            CT *= 0.95  # Lower the threshold slightly
        else:
            # Stock stable or increasing; maintain or increase CT
            CT = min(CT + (capacity - CT)*0.1, capacity)
    
    # Keep CT within reasonable bounds
    CT = max(capacity * 0.3, CT)  # Minimum cooperation level

Return action for this round
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization:** The strategy starts with a high CT to promote sustainable resource use.
- **First Round Cooperation:** Encourages others to cooperate by maintaining a high stock.
- **Dynamic CT Adjustment:** Responds to changes in the stock, adapting to increased defection or cooperation from others.
- **Defection in Final Rounds:** Maximizes immediate gains without regard for future depletion.

This approach ensures adaptability and robustness, effectively balancing between cooperation and defection based on observed outcomes.

To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a strategy where all players consistently cooperate. This ensures that the resource remains stable and provides a steady income for everyone involved.

**Answer:**

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate in every round}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_323 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing resource exploitation and preservation among multiple players, we propose a dynamic strategy that adjusts cooperation levels based on observed changes in the resource stock. Here's a concise step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Each player starts with an initial cooperation threshold set to half of the maximum capacity (threshold_i = capacity / 2).
   - In the first round, all players cooperate since the initial stock is at its maximum.

2. **Decision Making in Each Round:**
   a. Observe the current stock level.
   b. If the current stock is above their cooperation threshold, the player cooperates (C); otherwise, they defect (D).

3. **Adjusting Thresholds Dynamically:**
   a. After each round, compute the change in stock (ΔS).
   b. Use a moving average of ΔS over recent rounds to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
   c. If the moving average is positive, increase the cooperation threshold; if negative, decrease it.
   d. Implement safeguards to prevent thresholds from dropping too low when the stock is critically depleted.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to sustainably start resource utilization.
   - **Low Stock Trap:** If the stock remains below a critical level for several rounds, reset thresholds higher to encourage cooperation and resource recovery.

**Final Strategy:**

Each player employs a dynamic cooperation threshold strategy that adapts based on observed changes in the resource stock. By balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, players prevent resource depletion while optimizing their exploitation of shared resources.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is for each player to dynamically adjust their cooperation level based on the current stock and historical trends. They use a moving average of stock changes to update their thresholds, ensuring sustainable resource management. The final answer is:

description_COLLECTIVE_324 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting decisions based on the current state of the common pool. The strategy uses thresholds and trends to decide between cooperation and defection, ensuring adaptability across various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Description:

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** When the stock is above 80% of capacity or when the stock has been increasing in recent rounds.
   - **Defect (D):** When the stock is below 60% of capacity or when the stock has been decreasing in recent rounds.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to maintain a higher initial stock for future sustainability.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.
   - **Very Low Stock (below 10% of capacity):** Defect to salvage any remaining resource before depletion.

3. **Adaptation Based on Trends:**
   - Between the thresholds of 60% and 80% capacity, adjust decisions based on whether the stock has been increasing or decreasing in recent rounds (considering up to two previous rounds).

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(history, current_round, r, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    
    stock_history = extract_stock_levels(history)
    current_stock = latest(stock_history)
    
    lower_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    upper_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > upper_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < lower_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Determine trend based on available history
        if len(stock_history) >=2:
            previous_stock = stock_history[-2]
            if current_stock > previous_stock:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            # Not enough history; default to Cooperate
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Thresholds:** The strategy uses 60% and 80% of capacity as thresholds. Cooperation is encouraged when the stock is healthy (above 80%) or improving within this range, while defection is favored when the stock is stressed (below 60%) or declining.
  
- **Trend Analysis:** Between the thresholds, the strategy checks recent stock trends to decide actions. If the stock has increased in the last available rounds, cooperation continues; if it has decreased, defection is chosen.

- **Edge Cases:** The strategy handles the first round by cooperating and the last round by defecting, ensuring a balance between long-term sustainability and immediate payoff optimization.

This approach ensures adaptability and responsiveness to changing conditions, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defection when necessary to optimize both individual gains and resource sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_325 = '''
**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Players will initially Cooperate in the first round to encourage sustainable resource use.
   - In subsequent rounds:
     - If the current stock is below 70% of the capacity, players switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.
     - If more than 25% of other players Defected in the previous round, players will also Defect this round as a form of retaliation or protection.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to start positively and encourage others to do the same.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** Use the above conditions dynamically. If stock recovers above 70%, revert to Cooperating if defection rates are low.

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   - Aim for mutual cooperation while incorporating mechanisms to respond to defection, preventing it from spiraling out of control.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def strategy(player_index, history, current_stock, capacity):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check stock level
    stock_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    if current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate defection rate from previous rounds
    recent_rounds = history[-1]  # Assuming history stores each round's actions
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in recent_rounds if action == 'D')
    defection_rate = num_defectors / len(recent_rounds)
    
    if defection_rate > 0.25:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

This strategy balances cooperation with necessary adjustments based on observed behavior and resource levels, aiming to sustain the common pool while deterring excessive exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_326 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation for sustainable resource use with defecting for immediate gain, we propose an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts based on the current state of the shared resource. This approach ensures cooperation when the resource is healthy and shifts to defection if the resource shows signs of depletion.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating when the resource level (stock) is above a certain threshold, which we set as 75% of the maximum capacity (`T0`).
2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Continuously monitor the stock levels over recent rounds. If the average stock is decreasing, lower the cooperation threshold to encourage more defecting. Conversely, if the stock remains stable or increases, raise the threshold towards `T0` to promote cooperation.
3. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Each round, decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock relative to the adjusted threshold.

This strategy allows for adaptability, ensuring that cooperation is maintained when sustainable and switching to defection when necessary to maximize immediate gains without causing irreversible resource depletion.

### Solution Code
```python
from collections import deque

def determine_action(current_stock, capacity, previous_stocks):
    # Parameters
    T0 = 0.75 * capacity
    m = 3                 # Number of past rounds to consider for adjustment
    delta = 0.1           # Amount to adjust threshold each time
    
    # Initialize recent_stocks with the given previous_stocks (assuming they are in order)
    recent_stocks = deque(previous_stocks, maxlen=m)
    
    # Update recent_stocks with current_stock if there's enough history
    if len(recent_stocks) >= m:
        average_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
        previous_average = sum(recent_stocks[:-1]) / (len(recent_stocks[:-1]) or 1)
        
        if average_stock < previous_average:
            # Stock is decreasing; lower threshold
            current_threshold = max(T0 - delta * capacity, 0.5 * capacity)
        else:
            # Stock is stable or increasing; raise threshold towards T0
            current_threshold = min(T0 + delta * capacity, capacity)
    else:
        # Not enough history to adjust threshold yet
        current_threshold = T0
    
    # Determine action based on current_stock and current_threshold
    if current_stock > current_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage
capacity = 100
current_stock = 100
previous_stocks = [100, 95, 90]  # Simulated previous stock levels

action = determine_action(current_stock, capacity, previous_stocks)
print(f"Action: {action}")  # Output will be 'D' or another based on the current state
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by cooperating when the stock is above `T0` (75% of capacity), promoting sustainable use.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: By monitoring recent stock levels, the strategy adjusts the threshold. If stocks are declining, it lowers the threshold to encourage defecting; if stable or rising, it raises the threshold to promote cooperation.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Each decision is based on the current stock relative to an adjusted threshold, ensuring adaptability to changing conditions.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, allowing for robust performance against various player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_327 = '''
The strategy is designed to adaptively manage cooperation and defection based on the current state of the common pool stock. It balances sustainability with maximizing immediate gains, especially as the game progresses towards its end.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation-Defection**

1. **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage sustainable resource use and prevent rapid depletion.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (Except Last):**
   - If the current stock is above a threshold (set at half of capacity), cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - If below this threshold, defect to maximize immediate payoff as the resource may be overused by others.
3. **Last Round:** Defect to take as much as possible since there's no future payoff.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'  # Defect in the last round
    else:
        threshold = capacity / 2
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate if stock is above the threshold
        else:
            return 'D'  # Defect otherwise
```

**Explanation:**

- **First Round:** By starting with cooperation, the strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment and prevent immediate resource depletion.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:** The decision to cooperate or defect depends on whether the current stock level is above half of capacity. Cooperating when the stock is sufficient ensures sustainable use, allowing the resource to replenish adequately for future rounds. Defecting when below the threshold responds to potential overuse by others, ensuring maximum immediate payoff.

- **Last Round:** Since there are no future rounds left, defecting maximizes the final payoff without concern for depleting resources for subsequent (non-existent) rounds.

This strategy is robust and adapts dynamically based on observed stock levels, making it effective against a variety of opponent behaviors.

**Final Answer: Balanced Harvest Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The Balanced Harvest (BH) strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff in the Common Pool Resource Game by balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It adapts dynamically based on the current state of the resource and historical data, encouraging cooperation when possible and signaling resource threats through defection.

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Round:** Cooperate to encourage others to do the same.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Calculate expected stock replenishment assuming all players Cooperated.
  - Compare actual stock change with this expectation.
  - If the stock decreases more than expected (indicating possible defection), Defect to signal the issue.
  - Cooperate if the resource is healthy and remains stable.

**2. Thresholds:**
- **Cooperate:** When the current stock is above 80% of capacity or recent changes are within expected bounds under cooperation.
- **Defect:** If the stock falls below expected levels, indicating over-exploitation.

**3. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Start with Cooperate to set a positive tone.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Adjust thresholds to be stricter, reducing tolerance for defection and signaling resource stress.

**4. Adaptability:**
- BH dynamically adjusts based on observed stock changes, encouraging others to Cooperate when the resource is healthy and defecting to signal threats when it's over-exploited.

This strategy ensures a balance between individual gains and collective resource management, making it robust against various opponent behaviors in the tournament setting.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_329 = '''
**Final Answer: Sustainable Harvest Strategy**

The strategy aims to maintain a sustainable level of resource consumption by encouraging cooperation and adapting to defectors' actions. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with cooperation in the first round to maintain the stock at its capacity.

2. **Monitor Consumption**: After each round, calculate the total consumption based on observed player actions. This helps determine if the current consumption rate is sustainable.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - If the expected total consumption is below 0.5 * capacity (a sustainable level), continue cooperating.
   - If it exceeds this threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains and prevent resource collapse.

4. **Adaptation in Later Rounds**: In the last few rounds, defect to exploit remaining resources without worrying about future sustainability.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
for each player i:
    history = []

for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action_i = 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate expected_total_consumption based on previous rounds' actions
        # For simplicity, use the average consumption of past rounds

```

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round**: All players start by cooperating.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of rounds)**: Switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains.
- **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock drops below a certain threshold, defect to exploit remaining resources.

**Rationale:**

The strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability. By cooperating initially and adapting based on others' actions, it encourages cooperation while allowing players to respond to defectors by maximizing their payoffs when necessary. This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors and promotes long-term resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_330 = '''
To address the problem of determining when to cooperate or defect in repeated interactions with other players, we propose a strategy that balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains. The strategy is designed to adapt based on current conditions and past behaviors.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first round, default to cooperation to encourage mutual long-term benefits.
   
2. **Adaptive Play in Subsequent Rounds**:
   a. **Check for Final Rounds**: If the current round is among the last 10% of total rounds (rounded up), defect to maximize immediate payoffs with no regard for future consequences.
   
   b. **Assess Stock Level**: Evaluate if the current stock exceeds 75% of its maximum capacity. If not, defect to prioritize short-term gains as the resource is too depleted for sustainable cooperation.
   
   c. **Evaluate Previous Cooperation Rates**: Calculate the percentage of players who cooperated in the immediately preceding round. If this rate is above 60%, cooperate again; otherwise, defect.

3. **Defection Thresholds**:
   - Use a combination of stock level and previous cooperation rates to decide whether to continue cooperating or switch to defection.

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent, hoping others will reciprocate, leading to sustainable payoffs.
  
- **Final Rounds Handling**: In the final 10% of rounds, defecting is optimal as there's no future payoff to consider. This maximizes immediate gains.

- **Stock Level Check**: By ensuring the stock remains above 75%, the strategy maintains a threshold for sustainability. If the resource drops below this level, cooperation becomes less viable, prompting defection.

- **Previous Cooperation Rate**: Monitoring others' past actions helps adapt the strategy dynamically. If a significant majority (60%) cooperated previously, continuing to cooperate is beneficial. Otherwise, defecting maximizes individual gain given others' behavior.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Determine the total number of rounds (`total_rounds`).
   - Calculate `k`, the threshold for final rounds: `k = ceil(total_rounds * 0.1)`.
   
2. **Round-Specific Decisions**:
   a. For each round from 2 to `total_rounds - k + 1`:
      i. Check if current stock > 75% of capacity.
      ii. Determine the percentage of players who cooperated in the previous round.
      iii. If both conditions are met, cooperate; else, defect.
   
   b. For rounds within the last `k`, always defect.

### Conclusion:

This strategy adapts to changing conditions by considering both resource levels and others' cooperation rates. It balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, ensuring optimal payoffs while encouraging mutual cooperation when feasible.

The collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to encourage cooperation while adapting to changes in resource levels and player behavior. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first round to maintain a sustainable stock level.
2. **Endgame Defection**: Switch to defection in the last few rounds to maximize immediate payoffs as there are no future repercussions.
3. **Resource Threshold Check**: Cooperate only if the current stock is above 50% of capacity; otherwise, defect to prevent resource collapse.
4. **Cooperation Rate Monitoring**: Continue cooperating if a majority (e.g., >60%) of players have cooperated in recent rounds; defect if cooperation drops below this threshold.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, cooperation_history):
    capacity =  # Given as part of the problem setup
    r =          # Total number of rounds
    k = 3        # Number of last rounds to defect
    X = 60       # Minimum cooperation percentage to continue cooperating
    m = 3        # Number of recent rounds to consider for cooperation rate

    if round_number == 1:
        return Cooperate
    elif round_number > r - k:  # Near the end of the game
        return Defect
    else:
        threshold = capacity / 2
        if current_stock < threshold:
            return Defect
        else:
            recent_coop = cooperation_history[-m:]  # Last m rounds' cooperation data
            coop_rate = (sum(recent_coop) / len(recent_coop)) * 100
            if coop_rate > X:
                return Cooperate
            else:
                return Defect
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Round**: Starts with cooperation to sustain the resource.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Switches to defection in the last few rounds to exploit remaining resources without regard for future sustainability.
- **Resource Check**: Maintains cooperation if the stock remains above half capacity, ensuring sustainable growth. Defects if the stock drops below this threshold to avoid further depletion.
- **Cooperation Monitoring**: Encourages continued cooperation when a majority of players do so, fostering a cooperative environment. Switches to defection if cooperation rates fall, preventing exploitation by defectors.

This strategy balances sustainability with self-interest, adapting dynamically based on observable state and historical player behavior.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_332 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment**

1. **Initial Phase (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Encourage a sustainable start by assuming others will also cooperate.

2. **Monitoring Excess Consumption (EC):**
   - After each round, calculate EC as total consumption minus the amount if everyone cooperated.
   - Track EC over recent rounds to identify trends of defectors.

3. **Switching to Defection:**
   - If EC exceeds a threshold for k consecutive rounds:
     - Switch to defecting for x rounds to punish defectors and incentivize cooperation.

4. **Defection Phase Adjustments:**
   - During defection, monitor EC.
   - If EC drops below the threshold before x rounds, revert to cooperation early.

5. **Recovery and Reassessment:**
   - After reverting, reassess based on new EC trends and stock health.
   - Prioritize cooperation if the stock is low to allow recovery.

6. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3):**
   - Focus on cooperation to maximize payoffs without worrying about future retaliation.

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- **First Round:** Default to cooperation to build trust.
- **Low Stock:** Prioritize cooperation to aid recovery, regardless of defectors.

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, encouraging mutual cooperation through adaptive responses and implicit coordination.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_333 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

The strategy is designed to promote sustainable use of the common pool resource by balancing individual gains against collective well-being. It adapts based on observed behavior and current stock levels.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds:** Start by Cooperating to foster a cooperative environment and observe others' actions.

2. **Stock Thresholds:**
   - **High Threshold (H):** 90% of capacity.
     - If the stock is above H, Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - **Low Threshold (L):** 50% of capacity.
     - If the stock is below L, Cooperate to conserve and allow regrowth.

3. **Middle Range (L < Stock ≤ H):**
   - If most players (≥60%) Cooperated in the last round, continue Cooperating.
   - Otherwise, Defect to signal or respond to others' strategies, encouraging them to cooperate more.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
   - For the last round (if known), assess recent behavior:
     - If most are Defecting, also Defect; else, Cooperate.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, n, capacity):
    H = 0.9 * capacity
    L = 0.5 * capacity

    if not history:  # First round
        return 'C'
    
    last_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    cooperators = sum(1 for a in last_actions if a == 'C')
    defectors = n - cooperators

    if stock > H:
        return 'C'
    elif L < stock <= H:
        # Cooperate if most players did, else Defect
        if cooperators / n >= 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Stock ≤ L
        return 'C'

    # Additional logic for last round (if known)
    if current_round == r:
        if defectors / n > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Rationale:

- The strategy begins with Cooperation to build trust and assess others' behavior.
- By using stock thresholds, it ensures the resource is sustainably managed, avoiding depletion when possible.
- Adaptive responses based on recent actions encourage mutual cooperation while addressing exploitation by Defectors.
- Handling edge cases like the first and last rounds ensures robustness across game dynamics.

This approach aims to maximize collective payoffs over time by fostering a balance between individual gain and communal resource preservation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_334 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect based on the current state of the resource, we can employ a strategy that balances immediate gains with sustainability. The approach involves observing trends in the resource level and adjusting actions accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Observe the Current Resource Level (S_current):** Check the current stock of the resource relative to its capacity.

2. **Determine Sustainability Threshold:** Establish a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) above which Cooperating is beneficial as it maintains or grows the resource.

3. **Analyze Recent Trends:**
   - Compare the current resource level with that of the previous round.
   - If the stock has increased, it suggests others are Cooperating; continue Cooperating to sustain growth.
   - If the stock has decreased, it indicates potential Defectors; switch to Defecting for higher immediate payoff.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - The current stock is above the sustainability threshold.
     - The resource level increased in the previous round.
   - **Defect** otherwise.

This strategy adapts to the behavior of others, promoting Cooperation when sustainable and switching to Defection when necessary to prevent resource depletion.

### Final Answer:

To decide whether to Cooperate or Defect based on the current state of the resource, follow this strategy:

1. If the current stock level is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) **and** the stock has increased in the previous round, **Cooperate.**
2. Otherwise, **Defect.**

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to observed trends in resource levels.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock is above threshold and increasing; otherwise, Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_335 = '''
To determine the Nash equilibrium in this scenario, we analyze the strategies available to each player and their payoffs. A Nash equilibrium occurs when no player can benefit by changing their strategy while others keep theirs unchanged.

Given that Cooperating yields a lower immediate payoff (S/(2n)) compared to Defecting (S/n), each player has an incentive to Defect to maximize their own gain, assuming others might Cooperate. However, if everyone defects, the stock depletes entirely, leading to a payoff of zero for all in subsequent rounds.

In this setup, the dominant strategy for each player is to Defect because it provides a higher immediate payoff regardless of others' actions. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is for all players to defect, resulting in the stock being fully depleted and no player receiving any payoff beyond that round.

**Answer:**

The Nash equilibrium occurs when every player chooses to defect. In this case, the entire common resource is taken, leaving nothing for future rounds.

$\boxed{\text{All players choose to Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_336 = '''
The AI's decision-making process is designed to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability by considering both the current state of the resource and the cooperative tendencies of other players. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: The AI starts by Cooperating in the first round, recognizing that beginning with maximum stock provides an opportunity for all players to sustain the resource.

2. **Monitoring Trends**: For each subsequent round, the AI calculates the moving average of cooperation rates from recent rounds. This helps gauge whether other players are predominantly Cooperating or Defecting.

3. **Stock Threshold Check**: The AI checks if the current stock level is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity). This threshold ensures that Cooperating won't deplete the resource beyond recovery.

4. **Cooperation Decision**: If both conditions are met—sufficient stock and a high enough average cooperation rate—the AI decides to Cooperate, contributing to sustainable resource management.

5. **Defection Trigger**: If either condition isn't met (stock is too low or others are defecting), the AI defects to maximize immediate gains, preventing being exploited by others' actions.

This strategy adaptively responds to the game's dynamics, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to optimize outcomes.

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on the current stock and historical player behavior.

---

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 25%):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Reasoning:** Establish a stable baseline and observe opponents' strategies.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Stock Health Check:**
     - If stock is above 75% of capacity, assess opponent behavior.
     - If stock is below 75%, switch to Cooperate (C) to aid replenishment.
   - **Opponent Behavior Assessment:**
     - Calculate the proportion of Defectors in recent rounds. If over 40%, consider defecting (D); otherwise, cooperate.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 25%):**
   - **High Stock (>75% capacity):** Defect (D) to maximize payoff.
   - **Low Stock:** Cooperate (C) to encourage potential growth before the game ends.

    if round_number > 0.75 * total_rounds:
        if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
            return 'D'  # Defect to maximize payoff in last few rounds

    if current_stock < 0.75 * capacity:

    recent_defectors = count_defectors(history, last_n=5)
    defector_proportion = recent_defectors / n_players
    
    if defector_proportion > 0.4:
        return 'D'  # Defect if many are defecting

            if player_action == 'D':
                total_defectors += 1
    return total_defectors
```

---

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to maintain a healthy stock.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Adjust based on current stock; defect if high, cooperate if low.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Cooperate to sustain resources for future rounds.
- **Low Stock:** Cooperate to encourage replenishment and avoid further depletion.

description_COLLECTIVE_338 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set a threshold at 50% of the initial capacity (e.g., if capacity is 100 units, threshold is 50).
   - Note the total number of rounds (r).

2. **Round 1:**
   - Since it's the first round and stock is at full capacity, choose to Cooperate.

3. **Subsequent Rounds (from 2 to r-1):**
   - After each round, observe the current stock level.
   - If the stock is above or equal to the threshold (50 units in our example), continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock drops below the threshold, switch to Defecting.

4. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Regardless of the stock level, choose to Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

5. **Adaptation:**
   - By monitoring the stock level and switching strategies based on whether it's above or below the threshold, the strategy adapts to the behavior of other players.
   - If many players are defecting, causing rapid depletion, the strategy detects this by the stock dropping below 50% and responds by also defecting.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is:

- Cooperate in the first round when the stock is at its maximum capacity.
- In each subsequent round, cooperate if the current stock level is above 50% of the initial capacity; otherwise, defect.
- Always defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletions.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when the stock is above 50% of its capacity, otherwise defect. Defect in the last round regardless of the stock level.}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_339 = '''
To address the problem of sustainable resource use while balancing individual gain, we propose a decision-making strategy based on the current stock level. This strategy aims to maintain or recover the resource when it's healthy and switches to maximizing immediate benefits when the resource is depleted.

### Strategy:

1. **Cooperate When Stock is Healthy:**
   - If the current stock \( S \) is greater than or equal to half of the capacity (\( C/2 \)), players should choose to Cooperate. This supports sustainable use, ensuring that the resource remains viable for future rounds.
   
2. **Defect When Stock is Depleted:**
   - If the current stock \( S \) drops below \( C/2 \), players should switch to Defecting. This action maximizes their immediate payoff, recognizing that the resource may not recover sufficiently in subsequent rounds.

3. **Final Round Exception:**
   - In the last round (\( t = r \)), all players should always choose to Defect. Since there are no future consequences, maximizing individual payoff is the optimal choice.

### Rationale:

- **Sustainability When Healthy:** Cooperating when \( S \geq C/2 \) ensures that consumption does not deplete the resource beyond its ability to recover. This maintains a stable stock level over time.
  
- **Maximizing Payoff When Depleted:** Defecting when \( S < C/2 \) allows players to secure higher immediate payoffs, acknowledging that the resource may be nearing depletion and future recovery is uncertain.

- **Last Round Optimization:** In the final round, defecting ensures players maximize their payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Example Application:

- **Initial Healthy Stock (\( S = 100 \), \( C = 100 \)):**
  - Since \( S \geq 50 \), all Cooperate. Each player receives \( 12.5 \) units, total consumption is \( 50 \), leaving \( 50 \). Growth restores the stock to \( 100 \) in the next round.

- **Stock Depletion (\( S = 62.5 \)):**
  - Players may start defecting if they anticipate future depletion. This could lead to further drops, emphasizing the need for careful monitoring and adaptation.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_340 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining cooperation among players to sustain a shared resource while allowing for defection when beneficial, we propose a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term resource health. This strategy is designed to encourage mutual cooperation when conditions are favorable and adapt by defecting when necessary.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Few Rounds):**
   - In the first two rounds, all players should Cooperate unconditionally.
     - Rationale: Establishes a baseline of sustainability and prevents early resource depletion, allowing the stock to remain stable as it grows back after each round of consumption.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision-Making (From Round 3 Onwards):**
   - For each subsequent round until the penultimate one:
     - Check if the current stock is above 50% of its capacity.
     - Assess whether at least 60% of other players Cooperated in the previous round.
     - **If both conditions are met:** Cooperate to sustain the resource and maintain mutual benefits.
     - **Otherwise:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, especially if cooperation is failing or the resource is strained.

3. **Defection in the Last Round:**
   - In the final round (round r), all players should Defect.
     - Rationale: Since there are no future rounds to benefit from sustainability, maximizing immediate payoff is prioritized.

### Detailed Decision Rules:

1. **For Rounds 1 and 2:**
   - Always Cooperate, regardless of other players' actions or the current stock level.

2. **For Rounds 3 to r-1:**
   - If:
     - The current stock (S_t) is greater than or equal to 50% of capacity.
     - In the previous round (t-1), at least 60% of other players Cooperated.
     - Then, Cooperate in the current round.
   - Else:
     - Defect.

3. **For Round r:**
   - Always Defect to maximize the final payoff without concern for future consequences.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, the resource remains stable and grows back each cycle, encouraging others to continue cooperating as they observe sustainable behavior.
  
- **Threshold-Based Adaptation:** This mechanism ensures that cooperation continues only when both the resource is healthy and a sufficient number of players are also cooperating. If either condition fails (e.g., due to defectors reducing cooperation rates or excessive consumption lowering the stock), players switch to defecting to protect their immediate payoffs.

- **Final Round Defection:** Recognizing that there’s no future payoff after the last round, defecting ensures players maximize their final gains without worrying about depleting a resource that won't matter afterward.

This strategy effectively balances between maintaining cooperation for long-term benefits and defecting when it becomes advantageous or necessary, ensuring a sustainable approach while adapting to changing conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_341 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a strategic approach that balances cooperation for long-term resource sustainability with defection to maximize short-term gains. Here's how you can apply this strategy:

### Approach
1. **Early Rounds (Cooperation Phase):** Start by cooperating in the initial rounds to establish a baseline and encourage others to maintain the resource.
2. **Middle Rounds (Adaptive Phase):** Monitor the stock trends. If the average stock drops below a threshold or shows significant decline, switch to defecting to maximize individual gain.
3. **Late Rounds (Defection Phase):** As the game nears its end, prioritize defection to secure maximum immediate payoff, knowing future rounds are limited.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock_history, capacity):
    # Early rounds: Cooperate
    early_rounds = min(3, total_rounds // 5)
    if current_round <= early_rounds:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # Late rounds: Defect
    late_start = max(total_rounds - (total_rounds // 5), 1)  # Last 20%
    if current_round >= late_start:
        return 'Defect'
    
    # Calculate threshold dynamically
    initial_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    decay_factor = 0.2 * capacity / total_rounds
    threshold = max(initial_threshold - decay_factor * (current_round), capacity * 0.5)
    
    # Consider recent stock trend
    window_size = min(5, len(stock_history))
    recent_stocks = stock_history[-window_size:]
    average_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
    
    # Check if stock is below threshold or showing a significant decrease
    if average_stock < threshold:
        return 'Defect'
    else:
        return 'Cooperate'

# Example usage:
capacity = 100
total_rounds = 20
stock_history = [100, 98, 95, 90, 88]  # Simulated stock levels

for t in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    action = determine_action(t, total_rounds, stock_history[:t-1], capacity)
    print(f"Round {t}: Action is {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **Early Rounds:** The strategy begins by cooperating to build a sustainable resource base.
- **Middle Rounds:** By analyzing the stock trend over recent rounds, the strategy adapts. If the stock drops below a dynamically adjusted threshold or shows significant decline, it defects to maximize gains.
- **Late Rounds:** As the game nears its end, the focus shifts to defecting to secure maximum immediate payoff, considering future rounds are limited.

This approach ensures a balance between maintaining sustainability and maximizing individual gain based on observed trends and game progression.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_342 = '''
To effectively address the challenge of balancing individual payoff with collective sustainability in a dynamic game environment, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round**: Begin by Cooperating to establish a sustainable stock level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Monitor the proportion of Defectors (D_rate) from the previous round and the current Stock Ratio (S_ratio = Current Stock / Capacity).
   - Use dynamic thresholds based on these metrics to decide between Cooperating or Defecting.
3. **Edge Cases**: Adjust behavior in the final rounds and when stock levels are critically low.

### Detailed Decision Rules

1. **First Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate.
   - **Rationale**: Starting with Cooperation helps maintain a stable stock level, fostering a sustainable environment for subsequent rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   a. **Calculate D_rate and S_ratio**:
      - **D_rate**: Proportion of players who Defected in the last round.
      - **S_ratio**: Current Stock divided by Maximum Capacity.

   b. **Decision Logic**:
      - If **S_ratio < 50%**:
        - **Action**: Cooperate.
        - **Rationale**: Low stock levels necessitate cooperation to allow growth and prevent further depletion.
      - Else if **D_rate > 70%**:
        - **Action**: Defect for the next few rounds or until D_rate decreases.
        - **Rationale**: High Defector rates indicate potential stock crash, prompting immediate payoff maximization.
      - Else:
        - If **S_ratio > 75% and D_rate < 30%**:
          - **Action**: Cooperate.
          - **Rationale**: Stable conditions support cooperation for sustainable payoffs.
        - If **50% < S_ratio ≤75% and D_rate < 50%**:
          - **Action**: Cooperate.
          - **Rationale**: Moderate stock levels with controlled Defector rates allow continued sustainability efforts.
        - Else:
          - **Action**: Defect.
          - **Rationale**: Higher risk of stock depletion or exploitation warrants defecting to secure immediate gains.

3. **Final X% of Rounds** (e.g., last 20%):
   - **Adjustment**: Gradually increase tendency to Defect as future rounds are limited, prioritizing immediate payoff over sustainability.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments**:
   - Periodically reassess thresholds based on observed stock recovery trends and player behavior patterns.
   - Incorporate a moving average of D_rate to reduce volatility in decisions.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Threshold Flexibility**: Adjust the thresholds (e.g., 50%, 70%) based on game-specific parameters or observed outcomes to optimize performance.
- **Stock Monitoring**: Continuously track stock levels and recovery trends to inform dynamic adjustments.
- **Player Behavior Analysis**: Use historical data on player actions to refine decision-making, enhancing adaptability.

This strategy balances individual payoff maximization with collective sustainability by dynamically responding to changing conditions, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_343 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on the current state of the common pool. The strategy is designed to be adaptive, ensuring sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Overview

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Cooperate if the current stock exceeds 75% of capacity (Upper Threshold):**
   - When the stock is above this threshold, cooperation ensures sustainable resource levels and mutual benefits for all players.
   
2. **Defect if the current stock falls below 50% of capacity (Lower Threshold):**
   - Below this threshold, defecting provides higher immediate payoffs while accounting for potential future depletions.

3. **Middle Range Strategy (50% to 75% of Capacity):**
   - Observe the cooperation rate from the previous round.
     - If more than half of the players cooperated, continue to cooperate.
     - Otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff while considering potential future adjustments.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate, as starting with a high stock level encourages mutual sustainability.
- **Rounds Near Depletion:** If the stock approaches critically low levels (below 50%), prioritize defecting to secure higher individual payoffs before potential resource exhaustion.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, n_players, history):
    upper_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    lower_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > upper_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < lower_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Middle range: consider previous cooperation rate
        if history and len(history) >= 1:
            last_round_actions = history[-1]
            cooperators = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions.values() if action == 'C')
            if cooperators / n_players > 0.5:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            # No previous history, default to Cooperate
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Cooperation Threshold (75% Capacity):** By cooperating when the stock is above this level, players help maintain resource sustainability and ensure steady growth.
  
- **Defection Threshold (50% Capacity):** Below this point, defecting maximizes immediate payoffs while allowing for potential resource recovery if cooperation resumes in subsequent rounds.

- **Middle Range Adaptation:** This strategy leverages the previous round's cooperation rate to decide current actions. If a majority cooperated last round, continuing to cooperate helps sustain resources; otherwise, defecting secures higher individual gains and may prompt others to reconsider their strategies.

This approach ensures adaptability, encouraging cooperation when sustainable while strategically defecting to maximize payoffs in challenging scenarios, thus achieving a balance between collective and individual interests.

**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Approach:**
   - Begin by Cooperating (C) in the first round to promote sustainability and observe opponents' actions.

2. **Stock Health Monitoring:**
   - Define a 'healthy' stock threshold, such as 75% of capacity. If the current stock falls below this, consider switching strategies.
   - Track the trend of stock levels over rounds to assess if the resource is being sustainably managed.

3. **Opponent Behavior Analysis:**
   - Keep track of how many opponents have Defected (D) in recent rounds. If a significant number defect, respond by defecting to encourage cooperation or protect against exploitation.

4. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate** if the stock is above the healthy threshold and fewer than a certain percentage of opponents have recently defected.
   - **Defect** if the stock is below the threshold or a high number of opponents have defected in recent rounds.

5. **Adaptive Mechanisms:**
   - Implement a graduated response where cooperation continues unless specific conditions (stock health, opponent behavior) indicate a shift to defecting.
   - Include a cooldown period after defecting to allow potential recovery of cooperation among opponents.

6. **Last Round Handling:**
   - In the final round, choose to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

7. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - As rounds progress, adjust thresholds for stock health and opponent defection based on remaining rounds, allowing more flexibility in later stages.

8. **Balanced Retaliation:**
   - Use tit-for-tat logic, where defection is met with defection in subsequent rounds, to discourage sustained exploitation by opponents.

9. **Edge Case Management:**
   - If the stock is critically low (near zero), prioritize defecting to maximize immediate gains before the resource depletes entirely.

10. **Sustainability Check:**
    - Calculate expected growth and consumption to determine if continued cooperation can sustain the stock or if it will inevitably lead to depletion, necessitating a switch to defection.

**Pseudocode Implementation Outline:**

```
for each round t in 1..r:
    if t == r:
        choose D
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        healthy_threshold = capacity * 0.75
        recent_defections = count_opponent_defections_in_recent_rounds(k)
        
        if current_stock > healthy_threshold and recent_defections < defection_tolerance:
            choose C
        else:
            choose D

        // Update history for next round
        update_opponent_history()
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy begins with cooperation to encourage a sustainable resource use.
- It dynamically adjusts based on the stock's health and opponents' behavior, switching to defection when necessary to protect against over-exploitation or sustain the resource.
- By incorporating recent history and adaptive thresholds, the strategy remains robust against various opponent behaviors while promoting collective sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_345 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and the number of rounds remaining. The goal is to maintain a healthy stock for sustainable future gains while maximizing immediate payoffs toward the end of the game.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the early rounds to build or maintain a high stock level, ensuring growth potential.
2. **Dynamic Thresholding:** Use a cooperation threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity). Cooperate if the stock is below this threshold to prevent further depletion and encourage regrowth.
3. **Defection in High Stock Levels:** If the stock is above the threshold and there are enough rounds remaining, defect to maximize immediate payoffs without risking collapse.
4. **Final Round Defection:** In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%), defect to prioritize short-term gains since future rounds no longer matter.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(S_t, t, r):
    # Define thresholds as percentages of capacity
    high_threshold = 0.7
    low_threshold = 0.5
    
    # Calculate the total number of rounds for dynamic adjustments
    total_rounds = r
    early_rounds = total_rounds // 4
    late_rounds_start = max(total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10), t)  # Last 10% of rounds
    
    if S_t is None:
        # Initial round, cooperate
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if in the last few rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoffs
    if t >= late_rounds_start:
        return 'D'
    
    # Check against high threshold: defect if above and not too early
    if S_t > high_threshold * capacity:
        return 'D'
    
    # Check against low threshold: cooperate if below
    if S_t < low_threshold * capacity:
        return 'C'
    
    # Middle rounds: decide based on remaining rounds
    # If many rounds left, encourage cooperation for future growth
    if (r - t) > (total_rounds // 2):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage:
# Parameters would be defined or passed in as needed
capacity = 100  # Example capacity value
current_stock = 80  # Example current stock
round_number = 50
total_rounds = 100

action = decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds)
print(f"Action decided: {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **Cooperation Threshold:** The strategy uses a high threshold (70% of capacity) to encourage cooperation when the stock is healthy but not excessively high. This helps in maintaining or growing the stock.
- **Defection Threshold:** When the stock is above 70%, defecting is considered safe and beneficial for immediate payoffs without risking collapse.
- **Late-Round Defection:** In the final 10% of rounds, defecting maximizes short-term gains since future rounds are irrelevant.
- **Dynamic Adjustments:** The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the number of rounds remaining, ensuring cooperation in early stages to build a sustainable stock and switching to defection as the game nears its end.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, aiming to maximize overall payoffs while considering the impact of each action on future rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_346 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation and defection for optimal resource management, we propose the following strategy:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating to maintain a healthy stock level, allowing for sustainable growth over multiple rounds.

2. **Threshold Monitoring:** Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity. If the stock is above 70% of capacity, continue Cooperating to preserve and enhance future resource availability.

3. **Switch to Defection:** If the stock drops below 70%, switch to Defecting. This adjustment allows players to maximize their immediate payoffs when the resource is at risk of depletion, preventing a situation where others might exploit the remaining resource excessively.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation:** While this strategy uses a fixed threshold, it can be dynamically adjusted based on the number of rounds remaining or historical stock trends. However, for simplicity and without additional tracking variables, maintaining a consistent threshold provides a practical balance between current gains and future sustainability.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to Cooperate when the current stock exceeds 70% of capacity and Defect otherwise. This approach balances immediate payoffs with long-term resource sustainability.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock > 70% of capacity, else Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_347 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Group Behavior**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to promote sustainability and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Before Last Few Rounds):**
   a. **Calculate Average Cooperation Rate:**
      - Compute the proportion of players who cooperated in previous rounds.
   
   b. **Assess Stock Health:**
      - Check if the current stock is above 70% of capacity and whether it's growing or stable.

   c. **Decision Logic:**
      - If both the cooperation rate exceeds 70% and the stock is healthy, continue Cooperating (C).
      - Otherwise, switch to Defecting (D) to prevent resource depletion.

3. **Last Few Rounds:**
   - Gradually increase defection tendency as rounds remaining decrease.
   - In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future sustainability.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment of Cooperation Threshold:**
   - After each round, adjust the required cooperation rate based on stock performance.
   - If the stock is low or declining, lower the threshold to encourage more defection.
   - Conversely, if the stock is robust, raise the threshold to promote continued cooperation.

5. **Smoothing Mechanisms:**
   - Use a moving average of past cooperation rates to avoid sudden shifts in strategy.
   - Adjust thresholds gradually to prevent oscillations between cooperation and defection.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decision(current_round, rounds_remaining, stock_level, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate average cooperation rate from history
    total_actions = sum(len(round) for round in history)
    total_cooperate = sum(action == 'C' for round in history for action in round)
    avg_coop_rate = total_cooperate / total_actions if total_actions != 0 else 1.0
    
    # Assess stock health (e.g., above 70% of capacity and growing)
    stock_health = stock_level >= 0.7 * capacity
    if rounds_remaining > 1:
        prev_stock = history[-1]['stock']
        stock_growth = stock_level - prev_stock
        stock_health = stock_health and stock_growth > 0
    
    # Determine threshold based on remaining rounds
    if rounds_remaining < 5:
        threshold = 0.3 * rounds_remaining / 5
    else:
        threshold = 0.7
    
    # Decision logic
    if avg_coop_rate >= threshold and stock_health:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base.
- It monitors the group's cooperation rate and the stock's health dynamically. If both conditions are favorable, it continues cooperating; otherwise, it defects to prevent resource collapse.
- As rounds near completion, it shifts towards defecting to maximize immediate gains without worrying about long-term sustainability.
- The use of a dynamic threshold ensures adaptability based on current game state and historical behavior, balancing between cooperation for mutual benefit and defection when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_348 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation (ARC)

**Objective:** Maximize collective payoff by encouraging sustainable resource use through adaptive cooperation and reciprocal actions.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to signal willingness to sustain the resource and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Until Last 10%):**
   a. Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the immediately preceding round.
   b. If at least 50% of players Cooperated, Cooperate in the current round.
   c. If less than 50% Cooperated, Defect (D) to signal disapproval and prevent being exploited.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   a. Assess the current stock level relative to capacity.
   b. Calculate potential payoffs from both Cooperating and Defecting considering remaining rounds:
      - If Cooperating keeps the stock within sustainable levels while providing decent cumulative payoffs, continue Cooperating.
      - If Defecting yields higher immediate payoff without causing significant depletion, consider Defecting but balance to avoid collapse.

4. **Adaptive Adjustment:**
   Use a weighted average of cooperation rates over the last 3 rounds to smooth out short-term fluctuations and avoid over-reacting to transient changes in behavior.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Balance between maximizing immediate payoffs and maintaining resource levels for potential future cooperation, especially if the stock is still high.
- **Small n (e.g., n=2):** Use the same 50% threshold. For even splits, treat as Cooperate to encourage mutual benefit.

---

### **Collective Mindset Alignment**

The strategy promotes a mindset where players are incentivized to Cooperate when others do, reinforcing sustainability and shared benefits. By reciprocally defecting when others exploit, it deters free-riding and encourages mutual cooperation.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(round_history, current_stock, total_rounds, round_number):
    n = len(round_history)  # Number of players

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate (last 3 rounds)
    lookback = min(3, round_number - 1)
    total_cooperate = sum(round['cooperate_count'] for round in round_history[-lookback:])
    cooperate_rate = total_cooperate / (n * lookback)

    if cooperate_rate >= 0.5:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

    # For last few rounds: adapt based on stock level and payoffs
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        simulate_cooperate_payoff = current_stock / (2 * n)
        remaining_depletion = sum([simulate_cooperate_payoff for _ in range(total_rounds - round_number + 1)])
        # Simplified growth check
        if current_stock - remaining_depletion >= current_stock * 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

    return 'C'  # Default to Cooperate if no conditions met
```

### **Summary**

The Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation (ARC) strategy promotes sustainable resource use by encouraging mutual cooperation and adapting based on observed behavior. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors in the tournament.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_349 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative Strategy with Tit-for-Tat Elements

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while promoting sustainable resource use through cooperation, adapting to other players' behaviors.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

#### **Initial Rounds:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This sets a positive precedent and encourages others to cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** Continue Cooperating unless evidence suggests significant defection by others.

#### **Dynamic Adaptation:**
- **Monitor Consumption Patterns:** Track the average consumption per player. If the stock decreases significantly, it may indicate Defectors.
- **Threshold-Based Switching:**
  - If the stock falls below a dynamically adjusted threshold (based on historical sustainable levels), consider defecting to maximize immediate gain before potential resource depletion.

#### **Tit-for-Tat Element:**
- Observe the majority action in the previous round. If the majority Cooperated, continue Cooperating; if the majority Defected, consider Defecting.
- Introduce a tolerance level (e.g., 30% of players defecting) before switching strategies to avoid overreacting to minor defections.

#### **Edge Cases:**
- **Last Round Detection:** If rounds are known or inferred as nearing conclusion, switch to Defecting to maximize individual gain in the final round.
- **Stock Collapse Warning:** If stock is critically low, switch to Defecting to salvage remaining resources.

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**

#### **First Round:**
- Cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and sustain the resource base for future rounds.

#### **Last Round (if known):**
- Defect to maximize individual payoff since there are no future rounds for retaliation or cooperation.

#### **Stock Collapse Scenarios:**
- If stock is nearing critical levels, defect to secure as much as possible before potential collapse.

### **3. Collective Mindset Alignment**

The strategy emphasizes sustainability and mutual benefit when possible. By initially Cooperating, it encourages others to do the same, maintaining a healthy resource level. The Tit-for-Tat element allows adaptation to other players' actions, promoting fairness and deterring excessive defection.

---

### **Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, n, r):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if it's the last round (if known)
    if is_last_round(history, r):
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate historical cooperation rate
    prev_coop = sum(1 for actions in history.values() if actions[-1] == 'C') / n
    
    # Determine current stock status relative to sustainable level
    sustainable_threshold = calculate_sustainable_threshold(current_stock, n)
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity  # Assuming capacity is known
    
    # If stock is below sustainable threshold, consider defecting
    if stock_ratio < sustainable_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    # Tit-for-Tat element: mimic majority action from previous round
    prev_round_actions = history[0][-1]  # Assuming all players have same history length
    majority_action = max(set(prev_round_actions), key=prev_round_actions.count)
    
    if majority_action == 'C':
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Consider defecting only if a significant number of players defected
        num_defectors = prev_round_actions.count('D')
        if num_defectors / n > DEFECT_TOLERANCE:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### **Notes:**
- **Dynamic Threshold:** The sustainable threshold should be adjusted based on historical data to reflect changing conditions and player behaviors.
- **DEFECT_TOLERANCE:** A predefined threshold (e.g., 0.3) indicating the proportion of defectors needed before switching strategies.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically to promote cooperation while protecting against excessive defection.

In a single-shot game where all players act simultaneously and without knowledge of others' choices, the Nash equilibrium occurs when every player defects. This leads to the immediate depletion of the resource because the total consumption exceeds the available stock.

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_351 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation among players in a scenario with simultaneous moves and no communication, we propose an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts based on observed behavior and stock levels. This approach aims to maximize collective payoff by encouraging cooperation while addressing defection when necessary.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate to establish a baseline and maximize initial payoffs while maintaining the stock level.

2. **Assess Stock Health:**
   - Track the stock level after each round (S_t) and monitor whether it is increasing, decreasing, or stable over time.
   - Calculate the trend of S over recent rounds to determine if cooperation is effective.

3. **Determine Cooperation Rate:**
   - Observe the number of Cooperate actions from all players in recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - If a high proportion of players are Cooperating, continue to do so to sustain the stock and encourage others.

4. **Adjust Based on Stock Trends:**
   - If despite cooperation, the stock level is significantly decreasing, it indicates that too many players are defecting.
   - Switch to Defect for a certain number of rounds (e.g., 3) to signal others and attempt to reset the dynamics.

5. **Re-evaluate After Defection Period:**
   - After defecting for the set number of rounds, check if the stock has stabilized or started increasing again.
   - If conditions improve, revert back to Cooperate; else, continue defecting for a bit longer.

### Key Considerations:

- **Thresholds:** Use thresholds based on stock levels (e.g., high at 80% capacity and low at 20%) and cooperation rates to decide when to switch modes.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** The strategy should adapt to changing conditions, adjusting the number of defecting rounds and thresholds based on game parameters like the number of players (n) and capacity.
- **Preventing Tragedy of the Commons:** By punishing defectors through temporary defection, the strategy incentivizes cooperation and prevents long-term stock depletion.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, n):
    if not history:  # First round
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    recent_rounds = min(5, len(history))  # Look back at last 5 rounds or fewer if not enough
    total_players = n
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate in recent rounds
    coop_actions = sum(round_data['coop_count'] for round_data in history[-recent_rounds:])
    coop_rate = coop_actions / (total_players * recent_rounds)
    
    # Define thresholds
    high_threshold = 0.8 * current_stock_capacity
    low_threshold = 0.2 * current_stock_capacity
    
    if current_stock >= high_threshold:
        return 'Cooperate'
    elif current_stock <= low_threshold:
        return 'Defect'
    else:
        # If most players have been Cooperating, continue to Cooperate
        if coop_rate > 0.7:  # Example threshold
            return 'Cooperate'
        else:
            # Check if in Defection Mode or transitioning back
            recent_defectors = sum(round_data['defect_count'] for round_data in history[-recent_rounds:])
            if recent_defectors / (total_players * recent_rounds) > 0.3:  # Example threshold
                return 'Defect'
            else:
                return 'Cooperate'
```

### Final Answer:

To maintain cooperation and optimize collective payoffs, players should start by Cooperating in the first round. They continue to Cooperate if most others are doing so and the stock remains healthy. If the stock decreases despite high cooperation or too many defect, they switch to Defect temporarily to signal others. This strategy balances sustaining resources with addressing defection, preventing long-term depletion.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{
\text{Players should initially Cooperate, continue if most do so and stock is stable, otherwise switch to Defect temporarily to encourage cooperation and prevent resource depletion.}
}

The strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game is a balanced approach that encourages cooperation while adapting to potential defections or resource depletion. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

### Strategy Overview:
- **Initial Move:** Start by Cooperating in the first round to maintain high stock levels.
- **Adaptive Play:** For subsequent rounds (except the last), Cooperate if both current stock is above 80% of capacity and a majority cooperated in the previous round. Otherwise, Defect.
- **Final Round Adjustment:** Always Defect in the last round as there's no future punishment.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round:**
   - Action: Cooperate
     - Reason: Maintain high stock levels to encourage sustainable use.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Check two conditions:
     a. **Stock Level:** Is the current stock above 80% of capacity?
     b. **Recent Cooperation:** Did more than half of players Cooperate in the last round?
   - If both conditions are met:
     - Action: Cooperate
       - Reason: Sustained cooperation keeps resources healthy.
   - Else:
     - Action: Defect
       - Reason: Prevent further resource depletion or respond to previous defections.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Action: Defect
     - Reason: Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Rationale:
- The strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains.
- By Cooperating when conditions are favorable, it maintains resource health and encourages others to do the same.
- Switching to Defect when cooperation falters or resources dwindle prevents further depletion and incentivizes others to reconsider their strategies.

This approach ensures a collective effort to sustain resources while adapting to changing behaviors and resource levels.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_353 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation for long-term resource sustainability with defection for immediate gains, we propose an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts players' actions based on observed trends in resource levels. Here is a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to help maintain or increase the resource level.
2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Track historical stock levels and adjust a threshold dynamically. If the current stock is above this threshold, players Cooperate; otherwise, they Defect.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Use a sliding window of past rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds) to determine if the resource level is increasing or decreasing. This helps in deciding whether to continue Cooperating or switch to Defecting.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate. This helps maintain the resource at its maximum capacity or allows it to regrow if depleted.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**:
   - After each round, calculate a dynamic threshold based on historical data.
   - For example, compute an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of past stock levels. The EWMA gives more weight to recent observations, allowing the strategy to adapt quickly to changes.
   - Formula: \( \text{Threshold}_t = \alpha \times \text{Stock}_{t-1} + (1-\alpha) \times \text{Threshold}_{t-1} \), where \( 0 < \alpha < 1 \).

3. **Decision Making**:
   - In each subsequent round, compare the current stock level with the dynamically adjusted threshold.
     - If **Current Stock > Threshold**: Cooperate to preserve or rebuild the resource.
     - If **Current Stock ≤ Threshold**: Defect to maximize immediate gains, especially if the resource is showing signs of depletion.

4. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Maintain a window of recent stock levels (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - Calculate the trend (slope) over this window using linear regression.
   - If the trend indicates an increasing resource level, continue Cooperating.
   - If the trend shows a decrease, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect in the final round since there are no future consequences for depleting the resource.
   - **Very Low Stock**: If the stock is critically low, prioritize defecting to salvage whatever gains possible before the resource collapses.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's illustrate this strategy with a sample scenario where \( n = 4 \), capacity = 100, and rounds = 5.

- **Round 1**: All players Cooperate. Stock remains at 100.
- **Round 2**: Calculate threshold based on Round 1 stock (100). Suppose α = 0.3; Threshold₂ ≈ 97. Since Stock₂ is 100 > 97, Cooperate again. Stock remains 100.
- **Round 3**: Similar to Round 2, players Cooperate as Stock > Threshold.
- **Round 4**: Suppose a few players start Defecting. Stock drops to 85. Threshold₄ is adjusted lower (e.g., 90). Since 85 < 90, more players switch to Defecting.
- **Round 5 (Final Round)**: All players Defect to maximize their last gains.

### Conclusion:

This adaptive strategy allows players to dynamically respond to the state of the resource. By balancing cooperation and defection based on historical trends and current levels, it aims to sustain the resource while allowing for opportunistic gains when necessary. This approach is robust against varying numbers of Cooperators and Defectors, ensuring a sustainable outcome where possible.

**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The collective strategy aims to sustain cooperation while adapting to potential threats from defectors. It balances current stock levels with recent behavior patterns to decide actions, ensuring long-term resource sustainability.

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to establish a baseline of sustainable resource use.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Check Stock Level**: If the current stock is above 70% of capacity, continue cooperating.
   - **Evaluate Recent Defection Rates**: If the stock is below this threshold, calculate the proportion of defects in the last m rounds (e.g., 3 rounds).
     - **Defect Decision**: If the defect rate exceeds 30%, defect to reduce consumption and prevent further depletion.
     - **Cooperate Decision**: Otherwise, cooperate, assuming others maintain sustainable practices.

3. **Final Rounds**: Continue cooperating to preserve the resource for as long as possible, maximizing overall payoffs even in the last rounds.

This strategy ensures cooperation when resources are healthy, switches to defection if necessary, and maintains sustainability through critical phases of the game.

description_COLLECTIVE_355 = '''
The collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize total payoff while maintaining a sustainable resource level. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Begin with cooperation in the first few rounds to maintain a stable stock level and encourage others to cooperate.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Use a dynamic threshold based on the current stock relative to capacity, adjusted by the number of remaining rounds.
   - Formula: `threshold = (current_stock / capacity) * adjustment_factor`
     - `adjustment_factor` decreases as rounds progress, lowering the required stock for cooperation.

3. **Behavioral Observation and Adaptation:**
   - Monitor the proportion of players defecting in each round.
   - Lower cooperation threshold if there's significant defection to prevent resource depletion.

4. **Endgame Adjustment:**
   - In later rounds (e.g., last 20%), increase defection likelihood as future impacts are minimal, maximizing immediate payoff.

### Detailed Strategy

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - Cooperate to build a stable stock base.
   - Observe others' actions to inform future decisions.

2. **Threshold Calculation:**
   - Adjust threshold each round based on remaining rounds and stock growth/decline.
   - Example:
     ```
     adjustment_factor = max(0.1, 1 - (round_number / total_rounds))
     threshold = current_stock * adjustment_factor
     ```

3. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Track stock changes to assess sustainability.
   - If stock drops significantly, reduce cooperation threshold.

4. **Defection Trigger:**
   - Cooperate if `current_stock >= threshold`.
   - Defect otherwise, especially in later rounds.

5. **Learning and Smoothing:**
   - Use a conservative approach to adjust thresholds based on past performance.
   - Smooth out sudden changes using weighted averages of stock levels.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    # Initial cooperation in the first 20% rounds
    if round_number <= 0.2 * total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate adjustment factor based on remaining rounds
    progress = (round_number - 1) / (total_rounds - 1)
    adjustment_factor = max(0.1, 1 - progress)
    threshold = current_stock * adjustment_factor
    
    # Check if stock is below the threshold or nearing the end
    if round_number >= 0.8 * total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    # Determine action based on stock relative to threshold
    if current_stock >= threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Conclusion

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation thresholds. It adapts to others' behavior through observed actions and adjusts in later rounds to maximize payoff without assuming coordination beyond observable outcomes.

description_COLLECTIVE_356 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable resource while responding to potential exploitation by others, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with adaptive defection based on the current state of the resource. Here's the step-by-step explanation and the final answer:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by always cooperating in the initial rounds. This helps maintain the resource at its maximum capacity since cooperation leads to sustainable use, as consumption is balanced by growth.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels:** Continuously observe the current stock level relative to the initial capacity. This allows players to detect when the resource starts to deplete significantly due to others' actions.

3. **Threshold for Defection:** Establish a critical threshold (e.g., 60% of the initial capacity). If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to defecting. The rationale is that significant depletion indicates potential exploitation by others, so maximizing immediate gains becomes crucial before the resource is exhausted.

4. **Return to Cooperation:** Once the stock recovers above the critical threshold, revert to cooperation. This helps in maintaining sustainable use again if the resource stabilizes or starts growing once more.

### Final Answer:

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold-Based Defection**

Each player follows these rules:
- Cooperate in all rounds until the current stock drops below 60% of the initial capacity.
- Once the stock falls below this threshold, defect to maximize immediate payoffs.
- If the stock recovers above 60%, switch back to cooperation.

This strategy ensures sustainable resource use when possible while allowing players to adapt and respond to significant depletion caused by others' exploitation.

**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to promote sustainable use of the common pool resource while adapting to other players' behaviors. It balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and past actions.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

- **Initial Round:**
  - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - **Reasoning:** Start by cooperating to encourage others to do the same, fostering a sustainable resource.

- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - **Stock Above 80% of Capacity:**
    - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
    - **Reasoning:** High stock allows for sustainable consumption and growth. Cooperating maintains this balance.

  - **Stock Between 40% and 80% of Capacity:**
    - **Action Determined by Past Behavior:**
      - Calculate the proportion of other players who cooperated in the previous round.
      - If more than half (≥51%) of other players Cooperated, choose C.
      - Otherwise, choose D to maximize immediate payoff while others are defecting.

  - **Stock Below 40% of Capacity:**
    - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
    - **Reasoning:** The resource is strained. Cooperating helps rebuild the stock and promote sustainability for future rounds.

---

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent.

- **Last Round (if known):**
  - While there might be temptation to Defect for higher payoff, continue Cooperating to maintain trust and encourage others to do the same in future interactions.

---

### **3. Collective Mindset Alignment**

The strategy aligns with a collective mindset focused on long-term sustainability and mutual cooperation:

- **Sustainability:** Prioritizes maintaining the resource above critical thresholds (e.g., 40%) to avoid collapse.
- **Reciprocity:** Encourages others to Cooperate by responding to their actions. If many Cooperate, continue Cooperating; if many Defect, consider switching to D to adapt.

---

### **Pseudocode**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, previous_actions):
    n = len(previous_actions) + 1  # Number of players including self

    # First round: always Cooperate
    if len(previous_actions) == 0:
        return 'C'

    # Determine stock thresholds relative to capacity
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.4 * capacity

    # Current stock level
    S = current_stock

    # Decision based on stock level and past behavior
    if S > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif S < low_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate proportion of Cooperations in previous round
        last_round_coop = sum(1 for actions in previous_actions[-1] if actions == 'C') / n

        # If majority (≥50%) Cooperated, Cooperate; else Defect
        if last_round_coop >= 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage:
n = 4
capacity = 100
initial_stock = capacity
previous_actions = []

for _ in range(3):  # Simulate 3 rounds
    action = decide_action(initial_stock, capacity, previous_actions)
    print(f"Action: {action}")
    # Update stock based on action and other players' actions (simplified for example)
    if action == 'C':
        initial_stock -= 100 / (2 * n)
    else:
        initial_stock -= 100 / n
    previous_actions.append([action] + ['D']*(n-1))  # Assume others Defect
```

---

### **Summary**

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and past actions, encouraging sustainability while responding to potential exploitation. It is designed to be robust against a variety of opponent behaviors in repeated interactions.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to promote sustainability and observe others' actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Check Stock Level:** After each round, evaluate the current stock level.
     - If the stock remains above a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Monitor Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Track the number of players who Defected in previous rounds when the stock was high.
   - If a significant proportion (e.g., >50%) of players Defected despite high stock levels, adopt a more aggressive Defect strategy in future rounds.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (approximately 20% of total rounds), switch to Defecting regardless of stock level, as future payoffs are no longer a factor.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
initialize:
    cooperate_next_round = True

for each round in r:
    if round == 1:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        remaining_stock = current_stock
        growth_rate = calculate_growth(remaining_stock, capacity)
        expected_stock = remaining_stock + growth_rate

        # Check if stock is above threshold
        if expected_stock > threshold:
            action = Cooperate
        else:
            action = Defect

        # Consider past defection rates
        if recent_defections_high():
            action = Defect

    # Update state based on current actions
    update_stock(action, others_actions)

    # Prepare for next round
    cooperate_next_round = determine_cooperate_next()
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to encourage mutual sustainability.
- **Last Rounds (e.g., last 20%):** Switch to Defecting to exploit remaining resources.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability, adapting dynamically based on stock levels and opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_359 = '''
To address the problem of determining whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock level relative to capacity, we'll outline a structured strategy. The goal is to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by considering the current stock level as an indicator of resource abundance.

### Approach
The strategy involves using thresholds to decide actions:
1. **Cooperate when the stock is above 70% of capacity:** This indicates ample resources, encouraging contribution to maintain stability.
2. **Defect when the stock is below 30% of capacity:** At this low level, defecting may still provide a benefit without causing significant further depletion.

This approach aims to maximize immediate gains while preventing over-depletion, ensuring sustainability for future rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity):
    if current_stock > 0.7 * capacity:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif current_stock < 0.3 * capacity:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        return "Cooperate"

# Example usage:
current_stock = 80  # Example value
capacity = 100      # Example value
print(decide_action(current_stock, capacity))
```

### Explanation
- **Thresholds:** The strategy uses 70% and 30% of the capacity as thresholds to decide actions. Cooperating above 70% helps maintain a healthy stock level, while defecting below 30% allows for immediate gains without contributing to over-depletion.
- **Decision Logic:** By evaluating the current stock against these thresholds, the decision-making process ensures a balance between contributing to resource sustainability and seeking personal gain.

This approach provides a clear and actionable strategy based on observable conditions, fostering both individual benefit and collective resource management.

description_COLLECTIVE_360 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability while deterring defection through adaptive behavior.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to set a positive precedent and encourage mutual cooperation.

2. **Stock Level Monitoring**: Assess the current stock level each round relative to capacity (high >75%, medium 50-74%, low <25%).

3. **Adaptive Actions**:
   - **High Stock (Above 75%)**: Cooperate unless others have defected in previous rounds when cooperation was expected.
   - **Medium Stock (50-74%)**: Monitor and adapt based on recent player behavior, leaning towards cooperation if others are cooperating.
   - **Low Stock (<25%)**: Consider defecting to maximize immediate payoff but be open to cooperation if others start doing so.

4. **Punishment Mechanism**: Defect in subsequent rounds if a player defects when the stock is healthy (above 50%), punishing them for irresponsible behavior.

5. **Forgiveness**: If a previously defective player starts cooperating, especially when the stock is low, forgive and revert to cooperation to rebuild trust and sustainability.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.
   - **Full Stock (Capacity)**: Cooperate confidently as growth can sustain any consumption.

### Pseudocode:

```python
players = {i: 'cooperative' for i in range(1, n+1)}
last_rounds = []

def decide_action(current_stock):
    if current_stock >= 0.75 * capacity:
        action = 'C'
        # Punish those who defected when stock was healthy
        for player in players:
            if player in last_rounds and last_rounds[player] == 'D':
                return 'D'
    elif 0.25 * capacity <= current_stock < 0.75 * capacity:
        action = 'C' if all(players[p] == 'cooperative') else 'D'
    else: # current_stock < 0.25 * capacity
        action = 'D'
    
    return action

for each round in rounds:
    for player in players:
        last_rounds[player] = decide_action(stock)
    update stock based on all actions
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Round**: All players start by cooperating to foster a cooperative environment.
- **High Stock (Above 75%)**: Players cooperate, but if others have defected when the stock was healthy, they defect in response.
- **Medium Stock (50-74%)**: Players monitor recent behavior; if most are cooperative, they continue; otherwise, they may defect.
- **Low Stock (<25%)**: Players defect to maximize payoff but can revert to cooperation if others do so.
- **Punishment and Forgiveness**: Defectors are punished by others defecting in subsequent rounds, encouraging them to cooperate again.

This strategy adaptively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, promoting cooperation while deterring defection through conditional behavior.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The approach is adaptive, dynamically adjusting based on previous rounds' outcomes and current stock levels.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to start sustainably.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** Evaluate the previous round's consumption and stock level to decide actions:
   - **If cooperation was successful:** Continue Cooperating.
   - **If many Defected:** Switch to Defect for a few rounds to encourage others to cooperate.
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** If the stock is low, prioritize Cooperating to aid regrowth.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Round 1:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation encourages sustainable use and sets a positive precedent.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   - **Step 1: Evaluate Previous Consumption:**
     - Calculate the total consumption in the last round.
     - Compare it to expected consumption if all Cooperated (n * S/(2n) = S/2) and all Defected (n * S/n = S).
     - Determine which scenario the actual consumption is closer to.
   - **Step 2: Decide Current Action:**
     - If closer to Cooperate, continue Cooperating.
     - If closer to Defect, switch to Defect for up to 3 rounds or until cooperation is observed again.
   - **Step 3: Consider Stock Level:**
     - If the current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), prioritize Cooperating regardless of previous consumption to aid regrowth.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Since there's no future consequence, maximize immediate payoff.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **Low Stock:** Shift to Cooperating to help regrow the stock.
- **High Defection Detected:** Temporarily switch to Defecting to encourage others to cooperate in future rounds.

This strategy is adaptive and robust, allowing it to respond to various opponent behaviors while maintaining a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to observed behavior and current state. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Cooperation Threshold**: Cooperate when the stock level is above 75% of capacity. This ensures sustainable resource use.
2. **Defection Threshold**: Defect when the stock drops below 75%. This prevents further depletion and potential collapse.
3. **First Round Behavior**: Start by cooperating to encourage others to do the same, as initial stock levels are set at full capacity.
4. **Adaptability**: Adjust actions based on current stock levels each round, without relying on complex history analysis.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Action**: In the first round, cooperate to promote a sustainable start.
2. **Threshold-Based Action**:
   - **Cooperate** if current stock > 75% of capacity.
   - **Defect** if current stock ≤ 75% of capacity.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round**: Defect for maximum immediate payoff, as there's no future impact.
   - **Stock Near Capacity**: If the stock is near full in a subsequent round, revert to cooperation.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_363 = '''
To address the problem of determining whether to cooperate or defect based on the current state of a shared resource, we can employ a strategic approach that balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability. The strategy involves setting a threshold for the critical stock level and adjusting decisions based on the number of remaining rounds.

### Approach
1. **Define Critical Stock Level (T):** Set a threshold as half of the capacity (0.5 * C). This serves as the minimum stock level required to sustain cooperation.
2. **Assess Remaining Rounds:** Determine if the current round is among the last two rounds. In these final rounds, defecting provides higher immediate payoffs without concern for future consequences.
3. **Decision Making:**
   - If in one of the last two rounds, defect to maximize immediate gain.
   - Otherwise, cooperate if the current stock (S) is above the threshold (T). This helps maintain sustainable resource levels.
   - Defect if the current stock is below T to avoid contributing to resource collapse.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(S, C, current_round, total_rounds):
    """
    Decides whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock level, capacity,
    current round number, and total rounds.
    
    Parameters:
        S (int): Current stock level of the resource.
        C (int): Total capacity of the resource.
        current_round (int): 1-based index of the current round.
        total_rounds (int): Total number of rounds in the game.
        
    Returns:
        str: "cooperate" or "defect"
    """
    T = 0.5 * C  # Threshold is half of capacity
    k_last_rounds = 2  # Number of last rounds to defect
    
    # Check if it's one of the last k rounds
    remaining = total_rounds - current_round + 1
    if remaining <= k_last_rounds:
        return "defect"
    
    # Decide based on stock level and threshold
    if S >= T:
        return "cooperate"
    else:
        return "defect"
```

### Explanation
The strategy begins by establishing a critical stock threshold (T) at half the resource capacity. This ensures that cooperation is only maintained when there's enough resource to avoid collapse. The decision-making process checks if the current round is among the last two, in which case defecting maximizes immediate payoffs. For other rounds, cooperation continues as long as the stock remains above T, promoting sustainability. If the stock drops below T, defecting prevents further resource degradation.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, providing a structured way to decide actions based on the current state and future considerations.

description_COLLECTIVE_364 = '''
**Final Answer:**

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance individual gain with collective sustainability by adapting based on observed behavior and stock levels. Here's a structured approach:

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to encourage others to maintain the resource and test their intentions.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock level is above 80% of capacity, cooperate to sustain the resource.
   - If the stock is below this threshold, consider defecting if a significant number of opponents have defected in previous rounds (e.g., more than 30%).
3. **Response to Defection**: Track the cooperation rate of opponents. If a high proportion (e.g., over 50%) have defected recently, increase defection frequency to penalize and encourage future cooperation.
4. **Last Round Handling**: Defect in the final round to maximize individual payoff since there's no future retaliation.

### Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Default to cooperation to set a positive tone.
- **Last Round**: Switch to defecting to capitalize on the lack of future rounds for potential retaliation.

### Adaptation Over Time:
- The strategy dynamically adjusts based on observed opponent actions and stock levels. If cooperation leads to sustainability, maintain it; if defection is widespread, respond with more defection to discourage further depletion.

This approach ensures a balance between individual benefits and collective resource management, adapting to various opponent behaviors while maintaining robustness across different scenarios.

description_COLLECTIVE_365 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to adapt dynamically, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It employs a threshold-based approach influenced by historical data and current stock levels.

1. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: 
   - Calculate a dynamic threshold based on past behavior and growth trends. This threshold determines when to cooperate or defect.
   - The threshold adjusts each round to reflect the evolving state of the stock and players' actions.

2. **Initial Round Strategy**:
   - Start with cooperation in the first round to establish a baseline and encourage others to contribute sustainably.

3. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate**: If the current stock is above the dynamic threshold, indicating sufficient resources for sustainable use.
   - **Defect**: If below the threshold, suggesting resource depletion that necessitates immediate gain to prevent further collapse.

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Track historical trends of stock levels and players' actions (cooperation or defection rates) to predict future behavior.
   - Adjust the threshold dynamically based on these trends, ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Default to cooperation to foster a sustainable initial state.
   - **Last Round**: Consider defecting for maximum immediate payoff since there's no future impact, though this depends on the current stock level and threshold.

6. **Sustainability Balance**:
   - When the stock is low, prioritize actions that allow recovery, even if it means lower immediate payoffs.
   - Monitor growth patterns to ensure that cooperation leads to resource replenishment rather than depletion.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining collective sustainability, adapting robustly to various opponent behaviors through dynamic adjustments and historical feedback.

description_COLLECTIVE_366 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting decisions based on the current stock level and historical actions of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to maintain a healthy stock level and encourage others to do the same, preventing rapid depletion.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Stock Thresholds:**
     - **Above 80% of Capacity:** Cooperate to sustain the resource and allow it to recover.
     - **Below 60% of Capacity:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since the resource is critically low.
     - **Between 60-80%:** Use a mixed strategy:
       - **Cooperate** with higher probability if recent history shows others are mostly cooperating.
       - **Defect** if there's significant defection by others, preventing exploitation.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 2 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff as there's no future round to consider sustainability.

### Decision Rules

- **Cooperate When:**
  - The stock is above 80% of capacity.
  - Recent actions indicate a majority of other players are cooperating, promoting mutual sustainability.

- **Defect When:**
  - The stock is below 60%, indicating critical depletion.
  - Observing significant defection by others (e.g., more than 50% defect in recent rounds), necessitating self-protection.

### Adaptation and Robustness

- The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the observed state (stock level) and historical actions, ensuring adaptability against various opponent behaviors without relying on coordination.
- It balances immediate gains with long-term resource management, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting to prevent exploitation or in critical states.

This approach ensures a robust and adaptive strategy that aligns with collective sustainability while protecting against exploitation.

1. **Initial Strategy**: Begin with Cooperation for the first few rounds to help maintain or build up the stock.

2. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - Set initial thresholds: `T_high = 0.8 * capacity` and `T_low = 0.5 * capacity`.
   - Adjust these thresholds dynamically based on whether the stock increases or decreases each round.

3. **Decision Rule for Each Round**:
   - If the current stock (`S`) is above `T_high`, Cooperate.
   - If `S` is below `T_low`, Defect.
   - For moderate stock levels between `T_low` and `T_high`:
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate from the last `k` rounds (e.g., 5 rounds).
     - If more than `Y%` (e.g., 70%) of players Cooperated, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

4. **Threshold Adjustment**:
   - After each round, adjust thresholds based on stock trend:
     - Increase `T_high` if the stock increased and decrease it if it decreased.
     - Decrease `T_low` if the stock increased to encourage Defection when necessary, and increase it if the stock decreased.

5. **Endgame Consideration**: In the last few rounds, prioritize Cooperation to maximize total payoffs.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is a dynamic approach that balances cooperation with defection based on current resource levels and historical behavior. Players should:

- Cooperate when the resource level is high or when most others have recently cooperated.
- Defect when the resource is low or when others are mostly defecting.
- Adjust their thresholds dynamically based on whether the resource is increasing or decreasing.

This strategy maximizes long-term payoffs by promoting sustainable cooperation while responding to potential over-consumption threats. The final decision rule is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock is high or most players cooperate; else, defect}}

**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize collective benefits while ensuring sustainability, adapting dynamically to game conditions.

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Cooperate (C):** When the stock level is above a dynamic threshold, calculated as a moving average of recent stock levels adjusted by historical growth rates and opponents' actions.
- **Defect (D):** When the stock level falls below this threshold or if past cooperation led to significant depletion.

### 2. Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to encourage sustainable use and assess opponents' behavior.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate gains, as there are no future consequences.

### 3. Collective Mindset:
Aim for mutual benefit by maintaining a balance between resource sustainability and individual payoff. Use historical data to adjust thresholds adaptively, ensuring the strategy evolves with game dynamics.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock, history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    if round == r:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate dynamic threshold based on moving average and growth potential
    avg_stock = moving_average(history['stock'])
    growth_potential = 2 * (1 - avg_stock / capacity)
    threshold = 0.6 * capacity + 0.4 * (avg_stock * growth_potential)
    
    if stock > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
- **Dynamic Threshold:** Adjusts based on historical stock levels and potential recovery, encouraging cooperation when sustainable.
- **Adaptation:** Uses moving averages to smooth out volatility, avoiding overreaction to single-round changes.
- **Learning Mechanism:** Incorporates past outcomes to refine decisions, balancing between cooperation for sustainability and defecting to secure gains.

This strategy aims to foster a stable environment where cooperation is rewarded unless necessary adjustments are needed to prevent resource depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_369 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in managing a shared resource, we propose a strategic approach that reacts dynamically to the state of the resource and historical trends. Here is a structured and elegant presentation of the strategy:

### Strategic Approach for Resource Management

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase**
   - **Objective:** Establish a healthy baseline for the resource.
   - **Action:** Cooperate in the first few rounds (e.g., 2-3 rounds) to prevent early depletion.

2. **Dynamic Thresholds for Decision Making**
   - **Upper Threshold (T_high):** Set at 80% of capacity (0.8 * C).
   - **Lower Threshold (T_low):** Set at 60% of capacity (0.6 * C).
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - **Above T_high:** Cooperate if past consumption indicates others are also managing the resource sustainably. Otherwise, defect cautiously.
     - **Between T_high and T_low:** Implement a mixed strategy where cooperation likelihood increases as stock approaches T_low.
     - **Below T_low:** Always cooperate to facilitate regrowth and prevent crashes.

3. **Monitoring Stock Trends**
   - **Action:** Track percentage changes in stock levels over recent rounds.
   - **Threshold Response:** If the stock decreases by more than a predefined percentage (e.g., 10%) over past rounds, switch to cooperation even if the current stock is above T_high.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment**
   - **Objective:** Maximize immediate payoffs while preventing resource crash.
   - **Action:** In the last 10% of rounds, defect unless the stock is below T_low, in which case cooperate to allow some recovery.

### Safeguards and Considerations

- **Preventive Measures Against Crashes:** By monitoring past consumption trends, the strategy can preemptively switch to cooperation if others' actions indicate overexploitation.
- **Optimal Sustainable Yield:** While the primary thresholds are set at 80% and 60%, being mindful of the resource's maximum growth rate around 50% capacity (c/2) can enhance long-term sustainability.

### Conclusion

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term resource conservation by dynamically adjusting actions based on observable stock levels and historical trends. It encourages cooperation when necessary and allows defecting cautiously when the resource is robust, aiming to sustain a healthy balance for optimal yield over time.

    previous_actions = state_history['previous_round_actions']

    # Initial Round
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Determine Stock Health
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.4 * capacity

    # If stock is healthy, Cooperate
    if stock >= high_threshold:
        return 'C'

    # If stock is low, Defect
    if stock <= low_threshold:
        return 'D'

    # Mid-level stock: Check previous actions
    total_cooperate = sum(1 for action in previous_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    cooperate_ratio = total_cooperate / n

    # Most Cooperated last round: Cooperate again
    if cooperate_ratio > 0.7:
        return 'C'
    
    # Many Defected last round: Retaliate with Defect
    else:
        return 'D'

    # Endgame Adjustment
    if round_number >= r - (r * 0.1):
        return 'D'
```

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperator**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - In the first round, Cooperate (C) to encourage a cooperative environment.
   - For rounds until the last 20%, calculate:
     - **R**: The average proportion of Cooperate actions in the last k rounds (k=3 or 5).
     - **S**: Current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If both R > 60% and S > 70% of capacity, Cooperate; else, Defect.
   - In the last 20% of rounds, always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**

   - **Last Few Rounds (last 20%)**: Always Defect regardless of other factors.

3. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   The strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability by adapting to others' actions and the current stock level, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion.

            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
- **Initial Cooperate**: Encourages others to cooperate by setting a positive example.

**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting based on the stock level and historical behavior of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Cooperate (C):** If the current stock is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), indicating sustainable levels.
- **Defect (D):** If the stock drops below this threshold, signaling the need for immediate extraction to prevent resource collapse.

### 2. Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others to maintain sustainability.
- **Last Round:** Defect, as there's no future punishment for maximizing payoff in the final round.

### 3. Adaptation and Memory:
- Adjust cooperation/defection based on historical behavior: cooperate more if others have historically cooperated; defect if others have defected frequently, serving as a punitive measure against resource abuse.

### Strategy Summary:

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
function decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds):
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # Example threshold
    
    if current_stock > threshold:

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_373 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances individual gain with collective sustainability. The strategy dynamically adapts based on observed stock levels and past actions, ensuring robustness against diverse opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Sets a sustainable baseline by consuming less, allowing the resource to grow predictably.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:**
     - Use an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of past stock levels to assess sustainability.
     - The EWMA formula: `current_threshold = α * current_stock + (1 - α) * previous_threshold`
     - Parameter `α` (e.g., 0.7) determines the weight on recent data, balancing responsiveness and stability.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - If the current stock is above the EWMA threshold:
     - **Action:** Cooperate
     - **Rationale:** Indicates a sustainable resource level, maintaining long-term benefits.
   - If the current stock is below or equal to the threshold:
     - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - **Rationale:** Prevents further depletion and maximizes individual gain when cooperation isn't reciprocated.

4. **Defection Detection:**
   - Track whether cooperation leads to expected stock growth.
   - If unexpected depletion occurs, switch to defecting to protect against exploitation.

5. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Consider Defecting
   - **Rationale:** No future impact; maximize immediate gain unless others are cooperating, in which case continue Cooperating for higher payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(player_id, history, parameters):
    n = parameters['n']
    r = parameters['r']
    capacity = parameters['capacity']
    current_round = len(history)
    
    if current_round == 0:
        # Initial round: Cooperate
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of stock levels
    alpha = 0.7
    if current_round == 1:
        ewma_threshold = history[0]['stock']
    else:
        ewma_threshold = alpha * history[-1]['stock'] + (1 - alpha) * ewma_threshold
    
    # Decision based on current stock and EWMA threshold
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    
    if current_round >= r - 2:
        # Last few rounds: Consider defecting
        return 'D'
    
    if current_stock > ewma_threshold:
        # Cooperate if sustainable
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Defect if below threshold
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to establish a sustainable resource level.
- **Dynamic Threshold:** Uses EWMA to adaptively determine the sustainability threshold, balancing responsiveness and stability.
- **Sustainability Check:** Continuously assesses whether the current stock allows for continued cooperation or necessitates defecting.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment:** Maximizes individual gain in the final rounds while considering collective actions.

This strategy promotes long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation when beneficial and adapting to exploitational behaviors through defection, ensuring robust performance across diverse scenarios.

**Adaptive Cooperator Strategy**

The Adaptive Cooperator strategy balances cooperation with adaptive responses to maintain the common pool resource sustainably. It uses current stock levels and recent player actions to decide between cooperating (C) or defecting (D).

---

### **Decision Rules:**
1. **First Round:** Always Cooperate to encourage a cooperative environment.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **High Stock (S > 80% of capacity):** Cooperate to maintain the resource.
   - **Low Stock (S < 60% of capacity):**
     - Check the number of Defections in the previous two rounds by other players.
     - If more than half of the players Defected, respond with Defection.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate to aid recovery.
   - **Medium Stock (60% ≤ S ≤ 80%):**
     - Calculate the average Defection rate over the last three rounds.
     - If this rate exceeds 30%, Defect; else, Cooperate.

3. **Near End of Game (Last ~10% Rounds):** Always Cooperate to avoid depleting the resource in final rounds.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**
- **Stock Collapse (S = 0):** Continue Cooperating to attempt recovery.
- **Sustained Defection:** Adapt by defecting if others persistently defect.

This strategy aims to maintain cooperation while responding to exploitative behavior, ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

1. **Initial Rounds (First 3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to signal willingness to sustain the resource and observe others' behavior.

2. **Mid-Game (From Round 4 until 70% of Total Rounds):**

   - **If Current Stock > 60% of Capacity:**
     - **Action:** Defect.
     - **Rationale:** Higher stock allows defecting without immediate harm, maximizing personal gain while others may also defect.
   - **Else (Stock between 40%-60%):**
     - Calculate the cooperation rate in the last 3 rounds:
       - If >50% of players Cooperated: Cooperate to maintain mutual benefits.

3. **End-Game (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** No future rounds; prioritize maximizing immediate payoff.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**
- **Stock Near Zero (<20% Capacity):**
  - **Action:** Cooperate.

### **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
The strategy promotes sustainability by default, defecting only when safe or advantageous. It balances self-interest with collective well-being, adapting dynamically based on stock levels and others' actions.

        else:
            return 'D'
    
    if round_number >= endgame_round:

**Explanation:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by Cooperating to build a sustainable base.

To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a resource management scenario, we can employ a strategic approach that encourages cooperation when resources are abundant and switches to defecting when necessary to prevent collapse. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Define Thresholds**: Establish a threshold based on a fraction of the total capacity (e.g., 75%). This threshold determines when players should cooperate or defect.
   
2. **Cooperate When Resources Are Abundant**: If the current stock level is above the defined threshold, players should cooperate to sustain the resource and ensure stable payoffs.

3. **Defect When Necessary**: If the stock falls below the threshold, players switch to defecting. This allows them to maximize their immediate gains before potential collapse, though it risks further depleting the resource.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment of Thresholds**: Periodically reassess and adjust the threshold based on historical trends and the effectiveness of previous strategies. This ensures adaptability to changing conditions.

5. **Prevent Collapse**: Monitor stock levels closely. If the stock approaches critically low levels, consider reverting to cooperation or implementing measures to rebuild resources, even if it means accepting lower immediate gains.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy involves cooperating when the resource level is above a set threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) and defecting otherwise, adjusting dynamically to prevent collapse. This approach balances immediate benefits with long-term sustainability.

The Balanced Harvest strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to promote sustainable cooperation while adapting to different player behaviors and stock conditions. Here's a structured summary of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Balanced Harvest

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while maintaining a sustainable common pool resource.

**Key Components:**
1. **Stock State Categorization:**
   - **Healthy (H):** Stock ≥ 80% of capacity.
   - **Stressed (S):** 40% ≤ Stock < 80%.
   - **Endangered (E):** Stock < 40%.

2. **Decision Rules Based on Stock State:**
   - **Healthy (H):** Cooperate unless more than half of opponents have defected in the past.
   - **Stressed (S):** Defect if >50% of opponents have defected; otherwise, cooperate.
   - **Endangered (E):** Always defect to salvage remaining resources.

3. **Memory Mechanism:**
   - Track opponents' defection rates over time.
   - Punish persistent defectors by defecting in response.
   - Reward cooperation with continued cooperation.

### Detailed Strategy Description:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - All players start by Cooperating (C) to maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Healthy Stock (H):** Continue Cooperating unless historical data shows >50% defection among opponents.
     - Aim: Sustain the resource and encourage others to cooperate.
   - **Stressed Stock (S):** Defect if more than half of past actions from opponents were D; otherwise, Cooperate.
     - Aim: Punish defectors while maintaining cooperation when possible.
   - **Endangered Stock (E):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff before potential collapse.
     - Aim: Salvage remaining resources as the stock is unlikely to recover.

3. **Memory and Adaptation:**
   - Maintain a record of each opponent's past actions (C or D).
   - Use this history to inform current decisions, especially in transitioning between states.
   - Adjust thresholds based on observed behavior patterns to optimize outcomes.

### Performance Considerations:

- **Scalability:** The strategy adapts well to varying numbers of players and rounds, focusing on collective impact rather than individual influence.
- **Robustness:** It handles different opponent behaviors without relying on specific coordination mechanisms, promoting mutual cooperation through adaptive responses.
- **Edge Cases:** Special handling for the first round (cooperation) and the last round (state-based decision) ensures optimal outcomes regardless of the game's stage.

### Conclusion:

The Balanced Harvest strategy effectively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. By categorizing stock states and using historical data to inform decisions, it promotes cooperation while deterring defection, leading to a stable and productive common pool resource over multiple rounds.

description_COLLECTIVE_378 = '''
To address the problem of sustainably managing a shared resource, we can implement a strategy that encourages cooperation while allowing for adjustments based on the current state of the resource. The solution involves setting thresholds to determine when players should cooperate or defect, ensuring the resource remains stable over time.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Critical Threshold:** Determine a critical threshold (X) at which the resource level indicates whether cooperation is beneficial. In this case, X is set to half of the maximum capacity (cap/2).

2. **Define Player Strategies:** Each player will follow these rules:
   - If the current stock of the resource is above X (cap/2), players Cooperate by consuming a smaller share.
   - If the stock is below or equal to X, players Defect by consuming a larger share.

3. **Cooperation Mechanism:** When all players Cooperate (i.e., when the stock remains above cap/2), their consumption levels are set such that the total consumption does not exceed half of the resource's capacity each round. This maintains the stock at its maximum level due to growth replenishing it.

4. **Defection Adjustment:** If any player chooses to Defect, causing an increase in total consumption, the resource may temporarily drop below cap/2. In response, all players will adjust their behavior by defecting (consuming more), which might further decrease the stock but allows for higher individual payoffs in that round.

5. **Resource Recovery:** Even if the stock drops below cap/2 due to Defections, the natural growth of the resource can bring it back above the threshold in subsequent rounds, encouraging players to return to Cooperating behavior and stabilizing the system.

**Answer:**

To sustainably manage the shared resource while maximizing individual payoffs, each player should follow this strategy:

- **Cooperate:** If the current stock is greater than half of its maximum capacity (cap/2), consume a smaller share equal to cap divided by twice the number of players (cap/(2n)).
- **Defect:** If the current stock is less than or equal to half of its maximum capacity, consume a larger share equal to cap divided by the number of players (cap/n).

This approach ensures that the resource remains stable when all Cooperate and adjusts dynamically if any player defects, preventing irreversible depletion while allowing for optimal individual gains.

$\boxed{\text{If current stock > } \frac{\text{cap}}{2}: \text{Consume } \frac{\text{cap}}{2n}; \text{Else: Consume } \frac{\text{cap}}{n}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_379 = '''
To address the problem, we'll implement a strategy where each player initially cooperates. They then monitor the current stock level relative to a threshold (75% of capacity). If the stock falls below this threshold, players switch to defecting to maximize their immediate gain before potential resource depletion.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to encourage others to maintain the resource.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: Track the current stock relative to a predefined threshold (75% of capacity).
3. **Adjust Strategy Based on Threshold**:
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above or equal to 75% of capacity.
   - Defect if the current stock falls below this threshold, indicating over-exploitation.

This approach balances sustainability with immediate gain, adapting based on observed resource levels without requiring communication between players.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(last_actions, own_history, scores, payoffs, possible_actions):
    capacity = 100  # Assuming capacity is 100; adjust if necessary
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # 75% of capacity
    
    # Get current stock from the environment (assuming it's accessible)
    # For simulation purposes, we might track this ourselves or have it provided.
    # Here, we'll assume 'current_stock' is a variable that holds the latest stock value.
    # In reality, you'd need to retrieve this from the game state.
    current_stock = get_current_stock()  # Hypothetical function
    
    if current_stock >= threshold:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable environment.
- **Threshold Monitoring**: By checking against the threshold (75% of capacity), players decide whether to continue cooperating or switch to defecting. This helps maintain the resource when possible and maximizes personal gain when over-exploitation is detected.
- **Adaptability**: The strategy adapts dynamically based on observed stock levels, ensuring it remains effective even as other players' behaviors change.

This approach provides a balance between long-term sustainability and short-term gains, making it robust against various opponent strategies.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection based on the current state of the stock and historical cooperation rates, ensuring adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Evaluate the stock level and historical cooperation rates to decide between Cooperation (C) or Defection (D).

3. **Growth Mode (Stock > 75% of Capacity):**
   - Look at cooperation rates in the last two rounds.
   - If both rounds had more than 60% Cooperators, cooperate.
   - Otherwise, defect.

4. **Recovery Mode (25% < Stock ≤ 75% of Capacity):**
   - Consider the average cooperation rate over the last five rounds or since the stock dropped below 75%.
   - If the average is above 60%, cooperate.
   - Otherwise, defect.

5. **Conservation Mode (Stock ≤ 25% of Capacity):**
   - Regardless of previous actions, always cooperate to prevent further depletion and encourage resource recovery.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, cooperation_history):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if len(cooperation_history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Determine current state based on stock level
    if stock > 0.75 * capacity:
        mode = 'Growth'
    elif stock <= 0.25 * capacity:
        mode = 'Conservation'
    else:
        mode = 'Recovery'
    
    # Decision-making based on mode and cooperation history
    if mode == 'Conservation':
        return 'C'
    elif mode == 'Growth':
        recent_rounds = cooperation_history[-2:]
        avg_coop_last_two = sum(recent_rounds) / len(recent_rounds)
        if avg_coop_last_two > 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Recovery Mode
        lookback = min(5, len(cooperation_history))
        recent_coops = cooperation_history[-lookback:]
        avg_coop_recent = sum(recent_coops) / len(recent_coops)
        if avg_coop_recent > 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a positive example.
- **Last Rounds (if known):** If near the end, focus on maximizing immediate payoffs while considering the stock's recovery potential.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Maintain flexible strategies but encourage cooperation when possible.

This strategy dynamically adapts to the game's state and opponents' behaviors, promoting sustainability and mutual benefits by balancing short-term gains with long-term resource preservation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_381 = '''
**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

Our strategy aims to maximize each player's total payoff by balancing immediate gains with sustainable resource management. It adapts dynamically based on the stock level and opponents' actions, without assuming prior coordination.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin with cooperation in the first round to maintain a healthy stock for future rounds.
2. **Threshold-Based Adaptation:**
   - **Cooperate** if the current stock is above a dynamically adjusted threshold that considers the number of players and past consumption patterns.
   - **Defect** when the stock falls below this threshold, indicating potential resource depletion or excessive defection by others.
3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Adjust the cooperation threshold based on historical data:
   - Increase cooperation if the stock remains stable or grows, encouraging sustainability.
   - Decrease cooperation (i.e., increase defecting) if the stock declines sharply, indicating others are defecting excessively.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to establish a foundation for future rounds.
- **Last Round:** Balance between defecting for immediate gain and cooperating to avoid excessive depletion. Use a cautious approach, considering potential collective outcomes.
- **Stock Collapse Scenario:** If the stock is critically low, prioritize immediate gains by defecting to maximize current payoff before the resource collapses.

### Implementation Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, history):
    # Initialize threshold based on capacity and number of players
    n = number_of_players
    initial_threshold = capacity * 0.8  # Starting point for cooperation
    
    if it's the first round:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate historical consumption impact
    recent_consumption = average_past_consumption(history)
    threshold = adjust_threshold(initial_threshold, recent_consumption)
    
    if stock_level > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def adjust_threshold(initial_threshold, recent_consumption):
    # Increase cooperation threshold if past actions indicate sustainable play
    if recent_consumption < expected_coop_consumption:
        return initial_threshold * 1.05  # Encourage more cooperation
    else:
        return initial_threshold * 0.95  # Discourage cooperation, encourage defection

def handle_last_round(stock_level):
    # Balance between defecting and maintaining some resource for potential future rounds (though none exist)
    if stock_level > capacity * 0.5:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# In practice, the decision would integrate these components dynamically.
```

### Summary:

- **Adaptive Threshold:** Starts with a high cooperation threshold, adjusting based on historical consumption and stock trends.
- **Reciprocity Mechanism:** Encourages cooperation when others do, defects when others defect excessively.
- **Edge Case Management:** Explicit rules for the first and last rounds to handle unique scenarios without assuming coordination.

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to maintain collective resource health while responding to opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_382 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Start with Cooperate (C) in the first round as the stock is at maximum capacity, promoting sustainable consumption.

2. **Monitoring Stock Levels:**
   - Track the stock level after each round to assess its trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable).

3. **Adaptive Behavior Based on Stock Trends:**
   - **Growing Stock:** Continue Cooperating to sustain growth and maximize future payoffs.
   - **Stable Stock:** Maintain a mix of Cooperation and Defection, adjusting based on others' actions.
   - **Declining Stock:** Increase Defection (D) to encourage others to cooperate more, signaling the need for sustainability.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
   - **Last Few Rounds (r-2, r-1, r):** Shift towards Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs as there's no future impact.

5. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   - Foster cooperation by signaling through actions—defect when others over-consume to prompt a shift towards sustainability.

6. **Dynamic Adjustment Mechanisms:**
   - Use feedback loops, adjusting each round based on past outcomes and opponents' behaviors.

7. **Consideration of Payoff Trends:**
   - Balance immediate payoffs from defection with the need for long-term stock health, avoiding actions that lead to depletion.

8. **Testing Hypothetical Scenarios:**
   - Prepare for scenarios where all defect; respond by maximizing immediate gains in later rounds.

9. **Balancing Immediate and Future Payoffs:**
   - Find an equilibrium between current gains and future sustainability, ensuring maximum total payoff over all rounds.

10. **Thresholds for Action:**
    - If the stock drops below a certain percentage of capacity (e.g., 50%), increase defection to salvage resources or incentivize cooperation.

**Implementation Steps:**

- **Initial Phase:** Cooperate in the first round.
- **Mid-Game Adjustments:** Monitor stock trends; adjust between C and D based on whether the stock is growing, stable, or declining.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Defect more in the last few rounds to maximize immediate payoffs.

This strategy balances cooperation for sustainability with adaptive defection when necessary, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_383 = '''
To address the problem of sustaining a common resource through cooperative strategies among players, we can employ a structured approach based on thresholds and hysteresis. This method ensures that cooperation continues when the resource level is sufficient but allows for defection to prevent collapse when levels drop too low.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Thresholds:**
   - **Upper Threshold (T_high):** Set at 80% of the maximum capacity. Players will cooperate as long as the current stock is above this threshold.
   - **Lower Threshold (T_low):** Set at 60% of the maximum capacity. If the stock drops below this, players will defect to take more now while risking future depletion.

2. **Hysteresis Effect:**
   - Between T_high and T_low, players continue with their previous strategy (cooperate if they did last round, defect otherwise). This prevents rapid switching between strategies, which can destabilize the system.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Monitor Current Stock:** In each round, assess the current level of the resource.
2. **Apply Thresholds:**
   - If **Current Stock >= T_high (80%)**, all players cooperate.
   - If **Current Stock <= T_low (60%)**, all players defect.
3. **Between Thresholds:** Maintain the previous action:
   - If last round was cooperation, continue to cooperate.
   - If last round was defection, continue to defect.

### Rationale:
- **Cooperation Above T_high:** Ensures sustainable use of the resource when levels are healthy, allowing growth and maintaining stability.
- **Defection Below T_low:** Prevents catastrophic depletion by encouraging players to take more while the resource is still available, signaling a need for reset or recovery.
- **Hysteresis Between Thresholds:** Provides stability by avoiding abrupt changes in strategy, giving the system time to recover without oscillations.

### Example Walkthrough:
Consider a common pool with maximum capacity of 100 units and n=4 players.

- **Round 1: Stock = 100**
  - >=80 → Cooperate. Each takes 25 (total 100). Growth occurs, stock remains at 100.
  
- **Round 2: Stock = 90**
  - <80 but >60 → Follow previous action (cooperate). Each takes 22.5 (total 90). Remaining 10 allows growth to ~100 again.

- **Round X: Stock drops to 70 due to some defection**
  - Between 60 and 80 → Continue cooperation. Growth brings stock back above 80.

- **Round Y: Stock plummets to 50 due to widespread defection**
  - <=60 → Defect. Each takes maximum possible, leading to rapid depletion but signaling the need for a new cooperative phase once the resource recovers.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and allowing for necessary adjustments when resources are strained.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_384 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to balance long-term sustainability with short-term gains by dynamically adjusting cooperation based on the stock's health and trends. Here's a structured breakdown:

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate:** When the current stock is above 75% of capacity and has been stable or increasing over recent rounds.
   - **Defect:** If the stock drops below 40% of capacity or shows significant decline despite previous cooperation.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a sustainable base.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds):** Defect more to exploit remaining resources, as future gains from cooperation are limited.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds:**
   - Use moving averages or trends to adjust thresholds adaptively, ensuring responsiveness to others' actions and stock dynamics.

4. **Rationale:**
   - Promotes sustainability when the resource is healthy.
   - Encourages exploitation when the stock is at risk of collapse, preventing prolonged depletion.
   - Balances individual gains with collective needs through adaptive behavior.

This strategy ensures players respond to changing conditions, fostering a balance between cooperation and defection for robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_385 = '''
**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate unconditionally.
   - **Rationale:** Sets a positive precedent, encouraging mutual cooperation and maintaining resource stability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (From Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Dynamic Threshold (T) Calculation:**
     - If current stock (S) > 80% of capacity:
       - Set T = 70% (cooperation rate needed).
     - If S ≤ 80% of capacity:
       - Set T = 50% (lower threshold to encourage cooperation despite resource stress).

   - **Assessment Period:**
     - Consider the last k rounds (k=3 or k=5) to focus on recent behavior.

   - **Cooperation Rate Calculation:**
     - Compute the average cooperation rate of other players over the assessment period.

   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If average cooperation rate ≥ T:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Defect to respond to widespread defection and incentivize future cooperation.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect regardless of history or stock level.
   - **Rationale:** In the final round, there's no future punishment for defection, so players might as well defect for maximum payoff.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - **Stock Stability:**
     - When the stock is stable (near capacity), cooperation is maintained to prevent depletion.
   - **Resource Stress:**
     - Lower thresholds during resource stress encourage continued cooperation despite challenges.

5. **Adjustments and Considerations:**
   - **Oscillation Prevention:**
     - Use a higher threshold (e.g., 80%) for returning to cooperation after defection phases to prevent rapid shifts.
   - **Recent Behavior Focus:**
     - Emphasize recent rounds to adapt quickly to changing player strategies.

This strategy balances initial cooperation with responsive behavior, adjusting thresholds dynamically based on resource levels. It aims to maintain stable cooperation while effectively responding to defections, ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_386 = '''
**Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Response (ACDR)**

**Objective:** To maximize cumulative payoffs by promoting sustainable resource use through cooperation while adapting to defector behaviors.

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets a positive precedent and encourages others to maintain the stock for long-term gains.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Evaluate two factors from the previous round:
     - **Majority Action:** Whether more than half of the players Cooperated.
     - **Stock Trend:** If the stock increased or remained stable compared to the previous round.
   - **Action Decision:**
     - **Cooperate (C):** If both conditions are met (majority Cooperated and stock is stable/increasing).
     - **Defect (D):** If either condition fails (defectors are in majority or stock decreased).

3. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - Shift strategy to maximize immediate payoff:
     - Defect (D) if it leads to higher personal gain, as there's no future impact from resource depletion.

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to foster initial sustainability.
- **Last Round(s):** Focus on maximizing individual gain, possibly defecting despite potential long-term harm since future rounds don't exist.

### **Collective Mindset Alignment:**

ACDR promotes a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability. By rewarding cooperation with continued resource health and punishing defection through reciprocal defection, it encourages mutual cooperation and adaptability.

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def ACDR_strategy(player_index, history, current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Extract previous actions from history
    prev_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    
    # Determine majority action in the previous round
    num_players = len(prev_actions)
    cooperate_count = sum(1 for a in prev_actions if a == 'C')
    majority_cooperate = cooperate_count > num_players / 2
    
    # Check stock trend from last round to current round
    last_stock = history[-1]['stock_after']
    stock_increased = current_stock >= last_stock
    
    # Decision logic
    if majority_cooperate and stock_increased:
        return 'C'  # Continue Cooperating
    else:
        return 'D'  # Defect to encourage cooperation or respond to declining stock

    # Handle final rounds separately
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        # In last 10% of rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoff
        return 'D'
```

### **Rationale:**

ACDR starts by Cooperating to build a sustainable resource base. It then adapts based on others' actions and the stock's health, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to reset behaviors or maximize gains in final rounds. This balance encourages collective cooperation while being resilient against defectors and changing conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_387 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategic approach that balances individual gain with collective sustainability. The strategy is designed to adapt dynamically based on observed actions and current stock levels, encouraging cooperation while deterring excessive defection.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to follow suit and maintain a healthy stock level.
2. **Dynamic Decision Making**: In each subsequent round, decide whether to cooperate or defect based on:
   - The number of defectors in previous rounds.
   - The current stock level relative to predefined thresholds.
3. **Threshold-Based Adjustments**:
   - Cooperate if the stock is above a high threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity) and defection rates are low.
   - Defect if the stock drops below a medium threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) or if there's significant past defection to signal disapproval and encourage cooperation.
4. **Final Rounds Adjustment**: In the last few rounds, maintain cooperation if the stock is healthy to maximize individual payoffs without worrying about future consequences.

### Detailed Decision Rules

1. **First Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate
     - Aims to set a positive example and sustain the resource for subsequent rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-2)**:
   - Calculate metrics:
     - `stock_level`: Current stock.
     - `defectors_prev_rounds`: Number of defectors in previous rounds.
   - Determine thresholds:
     - High threshold: e.g., 0.9 * capacity
     - Medium threshold: e.g., 0.5 * capacity
     - Defection rate threshold: e.g., 30% of players defecting in the last round.
   - **Decision Logic**:
     - If `stock_level` > High threshold and `defectors_prev_rounds` < Defection rate threshold:
       - Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
     - Else if `stock_level` between Medium and High thresholds and moderate defection:
       - Cooperate, trusting others will follow suit.
     - Else if `stock_level` < Medium threshold or high defection rates:
       - Defect to signal dissatisfaction and encourage others to cooperate.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Round r-1 and r)**:
   - If the stock is above a certain level (e.g., 80% of capacity):
     - Cooperate to ensure maximum payoff without exploiting the resource.
   - If the stock is low:
     - Consider defecting as there's no future punishment.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```pseudocode
function decide_action(player_i, current_stock, history, round_number):
    n = total_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    r = total_rounds

    # Determine thresholds based on the number of players and capacity
    high_threshold = 0.9 * capacity
    medium_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    defection_rate_threshold = 0.3 * n  # 30% of players defecting

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate number of defectors in previous rounds
        last_round_actions = history[-1]
        num_defectors_last_round = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions.values() if action == 'D')

        # Check stock level and defection rate
        if current_stock > high_threshold and num_defectors_last_round <= defection_rate_threshold:
            return 'C'
        elif medium_threshold <= current_stock <= high_threshold:
            # Consider past cooperation trends
            recent_coop = count_coop(history[-2:])
            if recent_coop >= (n - defection_rate_threshold):
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            return 'D'

    # Additional logic for last few rounds
    if round_number > r - 2:
        if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Robustness and Adaptability

- **Adaptation**: The strategy adapts to different behaviors by adjusting based on observed defection rates and stock levels, ensuring sustainability without relying on coordination.
- **Feedback Loop**: By defecting in response to high defection rates, the strategy incentivizes cooperation and prevents resource depletion.

This approach ensures a balance between individual payoff maximization and collective resource management, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while promoting sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_388 = '''
To address the problem, we need a strategy that balances maintaining the shared resource while maximizing individual payoff. The approach involves observing the current state of the resource and adapting actions accordingly.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to maintain the resource level high.
2. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - If the stock is above 70% of capacity, continue Cooperating as it indicates a healthy resource with others likely contributing.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains.
3. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last few rounds (specifically the last two), always Defect to maximize payoff since there's no future impact.

This strategy ensures that we contribute when resources are abundant and defect when they become scarce or near the game's conclusion.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_round, total_rounds, capacity, stock_history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Check if in the last two rounds
    if current_round >= total_rounds - 2 and current_round <= total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    
    # Get previous round's stock after consumption and growth
    prev_stock = stock_history[-1] if stock_history else capacity
    
    if prev_stock > 0.7 * capacity:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round**: The first move is to Cooperate, fostering a cooperative environment.
- **Stock Monitoring**: By checking the previous round's stock level, we gauge whether others are contributing (high stock) or defecting (low stock).
- **Threshold-Based Decision**: A threshold of 70% capacity helps decide between Cooperation and Defection. This balance ensures sustainable use when possible and opportunistic gains when necessary.
- **Endgame Adjustment**: Switching to Defect in the final rounds capitalizes on immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds.

This approach efficiently balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically based on observed resource levels and game progression.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_389 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Conditional Cooperation**

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to establish a positive precedent and maintain a high initial stock for growth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Monitoring**: Track the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - **Recent History Analysis**: Examine the actions of other players in the last few rounds (e.g., last 3) to gauge cooperation levels.
     - Calculate a cooperation ratio by counting Cooperate actions and dividing by total possible actions.
   - **Decision Making**:
     - If stock is above a high threshold (e.g., 90% capacity) and cooperation ratio exceeds a set threshold, continue Cooperating.
     - If stock drops below a low threshold (e.g., 30%) or cooperation ratio falls below another threshold, switch to Defecting.
   - **Final Rounds**: In the last few rounds, prioritize immediate gains by defecting since there's no future punishment.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds and Adaptation**:
   - Use dynamic thresholds adjusted based on rounds remaining and stock levels.
   - Incorporate a buffer zone around thresholds to prevent volatility and include smoothing functions for transitions.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - In the first round, default to Cooperate.
   - Near the end of the game, defect to maximize immediate payoffs.
   - If the stock is exactly at a threshold or rounds are near completion, apply predefined rules to maintain stability.

5. **Learning and Adaptation**:
   - Balance between individual gains and collective sustainability.
   - Use a weighted average of recent actions to avoid predictable patterns and adapt smoothly to changes.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
for each round:
    if first round:
        choose Cooperate
    else:
        stock_level = current_stock
        history = get_last_3_rounds_actions()
        count_coop = sum(actions for player in history)
        total_actions = n * 3
        cooperation_ratio = count_coop / total_actions

        if stock_level > high_threshold and cooperation_ratio > threshold_ratio:
            choose Cooperate
        elif stock_level < low_threshold or cooperation_ratio < defect_threshold:
            choose Defect
        else:
            if rounds_remaining <= final_rounds:
                choose Defect
            else:
                if random() < adaptation_prob:
                    choose opposite of previous choice
                else:
                    follow current trend based on cooperation_ratio
```

This strategy balances between maintaining a sustainable resource level and preventing exploitation, ensuring adaptability to various opponent behaviors while prioritizing collective long-term benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_390 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation and defection in a repeated interaction where the goal is to maximize personal gain while ensuring resource sustainability, we propose an adaptive strategy. This strategy dynamically adjusts behavior based on observable changes in the resource (stock) level and its trend over time.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Phase:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative baseline to encourage others to also cooperate, promoting sustainable resource use.

2. **Middle Phases:**
   - **Monitor Stock Level and Trend:**
     - Track the current stock level and its trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable) over recent rounds.
   - **Decision Based on Stock Level:**
     - **If Current Stock > 80% of Capacity:**
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - **Rationale:** High stock indicates sustainable resource use; continue cooperating to maintain this state.
     - **If 50% < Current Stock ≤ 80%:**
       - Calculate a probability `p` to cooperate, where `p = (S - 50%) / (30%)`. This creates a sliding scale from 0 to 1 as the stock moves from 50% to 80%.
       - **Action:** Cooperate with probability `p`, else Defect.
         - **Rationale:** Balance between cooperation and defection, leaning more towards cooperation when closer to 80%.
     - **If Current Stock ≤ 50%:**
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - **Rationale:** Low stock indicates potential resource depletion; defecting maximizes immediate gains.

3. **Endgame Phase:**
   - **As Remaining Rounds Decrease (e.g., last 20% of total rounds):**
     - **Adjustment:** Increase tendency to defect, as there's less future payoff to lose.
     - **Action:** Always Defect in the final round(s) to maximize immediate gain.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - After each round, update the stock trend analysis (e.g., using a moving average over the last few rounds).
   - If the stock is decreasing despite cooperation attempts, increase the defection tendency.
   - If the stock recovers or shows an upward trend, reconsider increasing cooperative behavior.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to encourage others.
   - **Last Round(s):** Switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gain without concern for future rounds.

### Formal Strategy:

For each round after the first:
1. If current stock (S) > 80% of capacity:
   - Cooperate
2. Else if 50% < S ≤ 80%:
   - Calculate probability `p = (S - 50%) / (30%)`
     - Choose Cooperate with probability `p`, else Defect
3. Else (S ≤ 50%):
   - Defect

This strategy balances cooperation when resources are abundant and sustainable, while adaptively defecting as resources deplete or trends indicate others are defecting more frequently. It ensures a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability, adjusting dynamically to observed changes in the resource level.

### Final Answer:

The proposed strategy is an adaptive approach that begins with cooperation, monitors resource levels, and adjusts behavior based on stock trends and thresholds. Here's the step-by-step decision-making process encapsulated succinctly:

1. **Initial Round:** Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If current stock > 80% capacity: Cooperate.
   - If 50% < current stock ≤ 80%: Cooperate with probability `(current stock - 50%) / 30%`, else Defect.
   - If current stock ≤ 50%: Defect.
3. **Endgame Adjustment:** In the last few rounds, increase defection tendency to maximize immediate gains.

This strategy is designed to maximize personal gain while encouraging sustainable resource use when possible, adapting dynamically to collective behavior inferred from observable changes in the resource level.

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Thresholds**

1. **Initialization:**
   - In the first round, Cooperate (C) to signal willingness to sustain the resource and build a cooperative environment.
   - Set dynamic thresholds:
     - `high_threshold` = 0.8 * capacity
     - `low_threshold` = 0.5 * capacity
   - Maintain a window of recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5) to track opponents' defect rates.

2. **For Rounds t from 2 to r-1:**
   - Observe the current stock level (`S_t`) and calculate:
     - Recent defect rate = (number of defects in last k rounds) / k
   - Decision Rules:
     - If `S_t` > `high_threshold`: Cooperate.
     - If `S_t` < `low_threshold`: Defect to exploit remaining resources.
     - If recent defect rate > 0.5: Switch to Defecting (D).
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).

3. **Adjust Thresholds Dynamically:**
   - After each round, update thresholds based on observed growth and consumption patterns:
     - If stock recovery is poor despite cooperation, decrease `high_threshold`.
     - If defects are leading to rapid depletion, lower `low_threshold` more aggressively.

4. **Last Round (r):**
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff with no future rounds to consider.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Rounds:** Use a smaller window (e.g., last 2-3 rounds) for defect rate assessment due to limited history.
   - **Stock Recovery:** If stock grows significantly after cooperation, reset thresholds to encourage continued sustainability.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def strategy(current_stock, round_number, r, capacity, recent_defects_window):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    recent_defect_rate = sum(recent_defects_window) / len(recent_defects_window)
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < low_threshold:
        return 'D'
    elif recent_defect_rate > 0.5:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# For the last round, always defect
if round_number == r:
    return 'D'
```

**Conclusion:**

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adapting to current stock levels and opponents' behaviors. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection when necessary to prevent resource collapse or exploit remaining resources effectively.

**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase:**
   - Cooperate during the first 20% of rounds (initial_coop_rounds = r/5) to encourage a cooperative environment and allow the stock to stabilize or grow.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptive Response:**
   - After the initial phase, evaluate the current stock level:
     - If stock > 80% of capacity (high_threshold), continue Cooperating as it's sustainable.
     - If stock < 20% of capacity (low_threshold), switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains.
   - Between 20-80% stock level, assess recent behavior:
     - Calculate the proportion of recent defectors. If more than 30% of players have been defecting in the last few rounds, respond by defecting.
     - Monitor if the stock is decreasing rapidly; if so, switch to Defecting.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds (r/10), prioritize maximizing immediate gains by defecting.
   - If the stock drops too low in earlier rounds, adjust to start defecting earlier.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate without hesitation to encourage others.
   - **Last Round:** Definitely Defect as there's no future benefit.
   - **Stock Collapse:** If the stock is very low (below 20%), switch to always Defecting as recovery is unlikely.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, stock, capacity, r, n):
    initial_coop = r // 5
    
    if current_round <= initial_coop:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
        low_threshold = 0.2 * capacity
        
        if stock > high_threshold:
            return Cooperate
        elif stock < low_threshold:
            return Defect
        else:
            recent_defectors = count_defectors_in_last_rounds()
            defector_ratio = recent_defectors / n
            
            if defector_ratio >= 0.3 or is_stock_decreasing_rapidly():
                return Defect
            else:
                return Cooperate
                
def endgame_strategy(current_round, r):
    if current_round > (r - r // 10):
        return Defect
```

This strategy balances encouraging cooperation while adapting to others' behavior and endgame scenarios, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies.

To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource level while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a cooperative strategy based on a dynamic threshold. The strategy balances cooperation with defection based on the current state of the resource.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, all players Cooperate to maintain the maximum resource level (capacity). This ensures that the resource starts at its peak value, providing a stable foundation for subsequent rounds.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Decision-Making:** For each subsequent round, players assess the current stock of the resource relative to the capacity. If the stock is above 75% of the capacity, players Cooperate; otherwise, they Defect. This threshold is chosen to provide a buffer that allows for some depletion while still ensuring potential recovery through growth.

3. **Growth and Sustainability:** When players Cooperate, the total consumption is minimized, allowing the resource to recover and grow in subsequent rounds. The growth formula ensures that as long as the stock remains above 75%, the system can sustainably replenish itself.

4. **Response to Depletion:** If the stock falls below 75% due to Defectors or external factors, all players switch to Defecting. This collective action prevents further sustainable recovery but reflects a necessary response when cooperation is no longer viable for maintaining the resource.

**Answer:**

Each player should follow this strategy:

- In the first round, Cooperate.
- In each subsequent round:
  - If the current stock of the resource is greater than 75% of its capacity, Cooperate.
  - Otherwise, Defect.

This approach ensures a balance between maintaining the resource's sustainability and maximizing individual payoffs. The strategy promotes cooperation when possible and switches to defection only when necessary to prevent resource collapse.

**Final Answer:**

Each player should Cooperate in the first round and continue Cooperating as long as the current stock is above 75% of capacity; otherwise, they should Defect. This strategy is encapsulated in the following decision rule:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S > 0.75 \times \text{capacity}; \text{otherwise, Defect}}

To address the problem of deciding when to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in a repeated game with perfect information about past actions and the current stock level, we propose a strategy that balances sustainability with immediate payoff maximization. The strategy adapts based on the game's progress, the stock's health, and the behavior of other players.

### Approach
1. **Early Game Strategy**: Cooperate initially to build or maintain a healthy stock level.
2. **Mid-Game Strategy**: Monitor the stock level and recent cooperation trends among players. Cooperate if the stock is sufficiently high and others are mostly Cooperating; otherwise, Defect.
3. **Late Game Strategy**: Increase the tendency to Defect as future payoffs become less significant. However, continue Cooperating if the stock remains healthy and others are Cooperating.
4. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust cooperation/defection decisions based on observed trends in stock levels and recent player behavior.

### Explanation
- **Early Game**: The strategy starts by Cooperating to encourage a sustainable resource base.
- **Mid-Game**: It evaluates the current stock level and recent player behavior. If the stock is healthy and others are mostly Cooperating, it continues to Cooperate; otherwise, it defects to avoid exploitation.
- **Late Game**: As future rounds become fewer, the strategy leans towards Defecting more to maximize immediate payoffs, but still considers continuing to Cooperate if the stock remains robust.

This approach dynamically adjusts based on the game's progression and players' actions, aiming to balance long-term sustainability with short-term gains.

**Strategy Description: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initialization**:
   - In the first round, Cooperate to establish a baseline for sustainability.

2. **Decision Rules for Rounds 2 to r-2**:
   - **High Stock (Above 80% of Capacity)**: Cooperate to maintain sustainable resource levels.
   - **Moderate Stock (50%-80%)**: Assess recent cooperation rates among other players over the last three rounds.
     - If majority (>50%) have Cooperated, continue Cooperating to support sustainability.
     - Otherwise, Defect to prevent exploitation and encourage others to Cooperate in future rounds.
   - **Low Stock (20%-50%)**: Evaluate stock trend.
     - If stock has been decreasing for the last two rounds, Defect to exploit remaining resources before potential collapse.
     - If stable or increasing, cautiously Cooperate.
   - **Very Low Stock (<20%)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff as resource nears depletion.

3. **Final Rounds (r-1 and r)**:
   - Defect to secure maximum possible payoff in the last rounds without concern for future sustainability.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Sudden stock drops due to many Defectors: Consider defecting temporarily until stock stabilizes or recovers.
   - Stock exactly at capacity: Cooperate to maintain health.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection, encouraging sustainable resource use while responding to exploitation and resource depletion trends. It is robust against various opponent behaviors by dynamically adjusting based on current conditions and historical actions.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with adaptive defection based on the game's dynamics and stock levels. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy begins with cooperation to encourage sustainability and observes the resource's behavior over rounds. It adapts by defecting when the resource shows signs of depletion, ensuring both immediate gains and future sustainability.

---

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate in the first round.
     - **Rationale:** Establishes a sustainable baseline and encourages others to cooperate.

2. **Adaptive Defection Based on Stock Trends:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track the stock after each round.
   - **Threshold (T):** Set T as 60% of capacity (e.g., T = 0.6 * capacity).
     - If stock > T, continue Cooperating.
     - If stock ≤ T or shows a decreasing trend, switch to Defecting.

3. **Responsive Strategy:**
   - **Analyze Trends:** Observe whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable over several rounds.
     - **Increasing/ Stable Stock:** Continue Cooperating.
     - **Decreasing Stock:** Increase defection frequency to maximize immediate gains and prevent further depletion.

4. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - **Action:** Defect in the last round.
     - **Rationale:** Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

---

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **All Cooperate:** Strategy continues Cooperating, maintaining sustainability.
- **Some Defectors:** Detects stock dip and adjusts by defecting to protect against depletion.
- **First Round Adjustment:** No history; cooperation sets a positive precedent.

---

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, game_history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    T = 0.6 * capacity  # Threshold for sustainable cooperation
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate stock trend from past rounds
        recent_stocks = [round['stock'] for round in game_history[-3:]]
        avg_stock_change = (current_stock - recent_stocks[0]) / len(recent_stocks)
        
        if current_stock > T and avg_stock_change >= 0:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # Handle last round separately
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
```

---

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by Cooperating to foster a sustainable resource base.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Uses the threshold T and trend analysis to decide between C and D, ensuring adaptability.
- **Responsive Strategy:** Adjusts behavior based on observed trends, protecting against depletion and maximizing gains.
- **Final Round Adjustment:** Defects in the last round to prioritize immediate payoff.

This strategy effectively balances cooperation for sustainability with adaptive defection when necessary, ensuring robust performance across varying player behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_397 = '''
To address the problem, we developed a strategy that adapts based on the observed state of the shared resource over time. The approach focuses on maintaining cooperation while ensuring the sustainability of the resource.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Round:** Start by cooperating to encourage others and maintain the resource for future rounds.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (except last):**
   - Calculate the total consumption in the previous round using the change in stock.
   - Track the trend of the stock level over time.
   - If the stock remains above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), continue cooperating to support sustainable use.
   - If the stock is consistently below the threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains before the resource depletes further.
3. **Last Round:** Defect to secure the highest possible payoff in the final round since there are no future consequences.

### Implementation Steps:

1. Observe the initial stock level and start by cooperating.
2. After each round, calculate the total consumption by analyzing the change in stock (from S to S_new).
3. Use a moving average of the past few rounds' stock levels to determine trends.
4. Apply thresholds (e.g., 70%) to decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the observed trend and current stock level.
5. In the final round, defect to maximize payoff without concern for future impacts.

### Answer:

The optimal strategy involves dynamically adjusting cooperation based on the resource's state:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by cooperating to sustain the resource.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Track the stock level; if it remains above a threshold (e.g., 70%), continue cooperating. If it drops below, switch to defecting.
- **Final Round Defection:** Ensure maximum payoff in the last round by defecting.

This strategy balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection when necessary to maximize personal gain.

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_398 = '''
To address the challenge of sustainably managing a shared resource while optimizing individual payoffs, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy for Sustainable Resource Management

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Cooperate:** Start by contributing to the sustainability of the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 onwards):**
   - **Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
     - **Upper Threshold (X) = 80% of capacity:** If the current stock is above this level, continue to **Cooperate**.
     - **Lower Threshold (Y) = 60% of capacity:** If the current stock drops below this level, switch to **Defecting**.

3. **Middle Range Decision Making (When Y < Current Stock < X):**
   - **Trend Analysis:**
     - Calculate the average stock level over the last few rounds (e.g., 3-5 rounds).
     - If the current stock is higher than this average, indicating an upward trend towards sustainability, choose to **Cooperate**.
     - If the current stock is lower than the average, indicating a downward trend towards depletion, switch to **Defecting**.

### Explanation

This strategy balances between maintaining the resource for long-term benefits and responding to immediate conditions. By using thresholds (80% and 60%), it prevents drastic changes in behavior based on minor fluctuations. The middle range decision-making uses recent trends to adaptively choose actions, ensuring responsiveness without unnecessary oscillations.

### Example Walkthrough

- **Round 1:** Start with **Cooperate**, keeping the stock stable.
- **Round 2:** If others defect, leading to a drop below 80%, analyze the trend. If the stock is decreasing, switch to Defecting in future rounds until levels recover or sustainably manage.

This approach aims to maintain resource sustainability while allowing for strategic adjustments based on current conditions and trends.

The optimal strategy for players in this game involves starting with cooperation, monitoring stock levels and other players' actions, and adapting accordingly. Here is a detailed summary of the strategy:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to start sustainably.
2. **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.
3. **Middle Rounds**:
   - If the current stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity) and less than 30% of other players defected in the previous round, continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock drops below the critical threshold or more than 30% of other players defected in the previous round, switch to Defecting.

This strategy encourages cooperation when beneficial and adapts by defecting when necessary or in the final round. The key points are:

- Start with cooperation to maintain a healthy stock.
- Monitor both stock levels and others' actions to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
- Defect if the stock is too low or too many others defect, ensuring maximum payoff.

The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate in early rounds with healthy stocks; defect when necessary or in the last round.}}

description_COLLECTIVE_400 = '''
To address the problem of preventing resource depletion in a multi-player scenario where each player acts independently based on current information, we propose a refined strategy that balances cooperation and defection to maintain sustainable resource levels.

**Strategy: Threshold-Based Cooperation with Reciprocity**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of sustainability.
2. **Threshold Monitoring**: In each subsequent round:
   - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity and fewer than 25% of players Defected in the last round, continue Cooperating.
   - If either the stock drops below 75% or more than 25% of players Defected in the last round, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gain while signaling potential issues with cooperation.
3. **Recovery Check**: After defecting, monitor future rounds:
   - If in the next round, fewer than 10% of players Defect and the stock begins to recover (e.g., rises above 50%), revert to Cooperating to promote sustainability.
   - Continue Defecting if cooperation levels remain low or the stock continues to deplete significantly.

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages others to maintain sustainable practices by demonstrating willingness to share resources.
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Uses both resource levels and historical defection rates to decide actions. A high stock level (≥75%) indicates sustainability, while a low defection rate (<25%) suggests others are cooperating. If either condition fails, defecting becomes necessary to prevent further depletion.
- **Recovery Check**: After defecting, assess if cooperation has resumed sufficiently. A significant drop in defections and noticeable resource recovery signal that sustainable practices can be reinstated.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Start with Cooperate**: In Round 1, all players choose C.
2. **Assess Conditions Each Round**:
   - Check current stock relative to capacity (75% threshold).
   - Review previous round's defection rate (<25% to continue C).
3. **Adjust Strategy Accordingly**:
   - If conditions are met, Cooperate; else, Defect.
4. **Monitor for Recovery**: After defecting, check next rounds for improved cooperation and resource levels to decide if reverting to C is feasible.

This strategy aims to prevent premature defection that leads to resource crashes while encouraging sustainable practices when possible. By balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, it fosters a cooperative environment unless significant defection indicates the need for self-protection.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal independent strategy is to Cooperate initially and continue doing so as long as the current stock remains above 75% of capacity and fewer than 25% of players Defected in the last round. If either condition fails, switch to Defecting. After defecting, revert to Cooperating only if subsequent rounds show a significant decrease in defection rates (below 10%) and noticeable resource recovery.

Thus, the strategy is:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; continue Cooperating if stock ≥75% and last round's defection <25%; else Defect}}$

To address the problem, we developed a strategy that promotes cooperation while allowing defection under specific conditions. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to maintain the resource level.

2. **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff as there are no future rounds to consider.

3. **Conditional Cooperation in Intermediate Rounds**:
   - **Cooperation Check**: Evaluate if more than half of the players Cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Resource Check**: Ensure that after consumption in the previous round, the resource level remained above 50% of its capacity.
   
4. **Defection Trigger**: If either the cooperation rate is low or the resource level drops below the threshold, all players Defect to prevent further depletion and secure immediate gains.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy balances cooperation with necessary defection based on resource health and others' actions. Players Cooperate initially but defect if previous round cooperation was low or resources fell below 50% capacity. This approach aims to sustain the resource while allowing players to maximize their payoffs when conditions warrant defection.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate in all rounds except the last, where you defect. Additionally, cooperate only if more than half of the players cooperated in the previous round and the resource level after consumption was above 50% capacity; otherwise, defect.}}

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Punishment (ACDP)**

The ACDP strategy is designed for the Common Pool Resource Game to maximize collective payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability. It balances cooperation and defection based on current stock levels, past actions, and game dynamics.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to establish a baseline of sustainability and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Observe the previous round's total consumption, individual actions, and resulting stock level.
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate among players. If more than 50% cooperated, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect (D).

3. **Stock Thresholds:**
   - Define a critical stock threshold as 25% of capacity. If the stock drops below this threshold:
     - Defect in the next round to signal resource stress and encourage others to conserve.
   - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, cooperate to maintain abundance.

4. **Punishment for Defection:**
   - Track players who consistently defect. After three consecutive defections by a player, others may start defecting in response, creating a feedback loop to discourage over-consumption.

5. **Endgame Adjustment (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - As the game nears its end (last 10% of rounds), prioritize preventing stock collapse.
     - Cooperate more frequently to sustain the resource, even if it means slightly lower immediate payoffs.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def ACDP_strategy(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = game_capacity()

    # Initial round: cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if in last 10% of rounds
    if round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        if current_stock > capacity * 0.25:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate from previous round
    prev_coop = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C') / n
    
    # Check stock thresholds
    critical_threshold = capacity * 0.25
    high_threshold = capacity * 0.75

    if current_stock < critical_threshold:
        return 'D'
    elif prev_coop > 0.5:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Track individual defection history
        defector_count = count_consistent_defectors(history)
        if defector_count / n > 0.3:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
def count_consistent_defectors(history):
    defectors = {}
    for player in range(n):
        defectors[player] = 0
    for round_actions in history:
        for i, action in enumerate(round_actions):
            if action == 'D':
                defectors[i] +=1
            else:
                defectors[i] = 0
    consistent_defectors = sum(1 for count in defectors.values() if count >=3)
    return consistent_defectors
```

### Summary:

The ACDP strategy begins with cooperation to build a sustainable resource base. It adapts by monitoring the stock level and players' actions, switching to defection when necessary to punish over-consumption or prevent resource collapse. In later rounds, it focuses on maintaining the resource to avoid endgame depletion. This approach balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, encouraging collective cooperation while deterring defection through strategic responses.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_403 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on the stock level and past player behaviors. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage resource sustainability.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
   - Use a dynamic threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) to determine cooperation.
   - If the stock remains above this threshold and most players have recently Cooperated, continue Cooperating.
3. **Adaptive Defection:** Switch to Defecting if the stock drops below the threshold or if there's significant defection observed among other players.
4. **Endgame Adjustment:** In the final rounds, defect to maximize personal payoff since future rounds no longer influence current decisions.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Few Rounds (Rounds 1-3):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Reasoning:** Encourage others to maintain the resource and observe their behavior.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Calculate Current Stock (S_t):** Determine if S_t is above a threshold, say 70% of capacity.
   - **Assess Recent Behavior:**
     - If in the last k rounds (e.g., 3), more than x% (e.g., 60%) of players Cooperated each round:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
       - **Reasoning:** Sustained cooperation indicates a healthy resource, encouraging continued contribution.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Defect
       - **Reasoning:** Others' defection threatens sustainability; defect to exploit while possible.

3. **Stock Below Threshold:**
   - If S_t < 70% of capacity:
     - **Action:** Defect
     - **Reasoning:** Resource is at risk; maximize personal gain before potential collapse.

4. **Last Few Rounds (Final 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Reasoning:** No future consequences, so prioritize immediate payoff.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round Without History:** Cooperate to initiate positive behavior.
- **Stock Drop Despite Cooperation:** If the stock declines despite many Cooperators, adjust threshold or increase defection likelihood.
- **Rapid Stock Decline:** Aggressively defect if the resource rapidly depletes, indicating others are not maintaining it.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity  # Initial threshold
    
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in initial rounds
    
    recent_coop_proportion = calculate_recent_coop(history)
    
    if current_stock >= threshold and recent_coop_proportion > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if round_number >= total_rounds - 2:
            return 'D'  # Defect in last few rounds
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Summary:
This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on resource levels and observed behavior, promoting sustainability while protecting against exploitation. It dynamically adjusts to maintain long-term viability unless immediate exploitation is more beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_404 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, we'll implement a decision-making framework that considers both the current state of the shared resource (stock) and the behavior of other players. Here's how to approach it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Thresholds and Parameters
- **Sustainability Threshold:** Set at 70% of capacity. Cooperate if stock is above this threshold.
- **Endgame Threshold:** Apply in the last 10% of total rounds, where defecting maximizes immediate payoff.
- **Cooperation Rate:** Monitor other players' cooperation rate over the past 3 rounds.

### Step 2: Evaluate Current Round Context
1. Determine if it's within the last 10% of rounds:
   - If yes, defect to prioritize immediate gains.
   
2. Calculate other players' average cooperation rate in recent rounds:
   - Use a moving average of the past 3 rounds to gauge current trends.

### Step 3: Apply Decision Rules
- **If not in endgame and others cooperate >50%:**
  - Cooperate if stock >70%.
  
- **Else:**
  - Defect to maximize personal gain, especially when sustainability is at risk or others aren't cooperating.

### Final Strategy:
Cooperate only when it's beneficial for long-term sustainability and when other players are also cooperating. Otherwise, defect to capture immediate gains, particularly as the game nears its end.

**Answer:**

In each round, you should cooperate if all three conditions are met:

1. The current round is not among the last 10% of total rounds.
2. The average cooperation rate of other players in the past three rounds exceeds 50%.
3. The current stock level is above 70% of its capacity.

Otherwise, you should defect.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if not in last 10%, others' recent cooperation >50%, and stock >70%; else, defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_405 = '''
**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to Cooperate when the current stock exceeds 80% of capacity and Defect otherwise. This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, promoting cooperation during prosperous periods while allowing for higher payoffs when resources begin to diminish.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock > 80% of capacity; otherwise, Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_406 = '''
The proposed strategy is designed to encourage cooperation while adapting to the behavior of other players. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation levels based on stock health and inferred actions from others. Here's the structured approach:

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT)

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while maintaining a healthy resource level for sustainable benefits.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First few rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Establish trust and maintain the common pool's health to encourage others to cooperate.

2. **Midgame:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track the current stock relative to capacity.
   - **Infer Others' Behavior:** Calculate total consumption from previous rounds to estimate others' cooperation levels.
     - If inferred cooperation is low, adjust thresholds to reduce cooperation.
   - **Dynamic Thresholds:**
     - **Cooperate** if the stock is above a threshold (initially set at 60% of capacity).
     - **Defect** if below this threshold, especially as rounds progress.
   - **Adjust Thresholds:** Lower the threshold if the stock consistently decreases despite cooperation.

3. **Endgame (Last few rounds):**
   - **Evaluate Stock:**
     - If high, continue Cooperating to sustain future gains.
     - If low, consider Defecting to maximize immediate payoff before depletion.

**Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a positive trend.
- **Last Round:** Adjust based on current stock health; Cooperate if sustainable, otherwise Defect.
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock is near zero, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds to maximize remaining gains.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def strategy(history, current_stock, capacity, num_players):
    round_number = len(history)
    total_rounds = r  # Total rounds known

    if round_number == 0:
        return 'C'  # First round cooperation

    # Calculate inferred cooperation rate from previous rounds
    def infer_cooperation():
        inferred_coop = []
        for past_stock, action in history:
            if action == 'C':
                consumed = past_stock / (2 * num_players)
            else:
                consumed = past_stock / num_players
            total_consumed = sum(consumed for _ in range(num_players))
            remaining = max(0, past_stock - total_consumed)
            growth = 2 * remaining * (1 - remaining / capacity)
            new_stock = min(remaining + growth, capacity)
            # Infer others' actions based on stock change
            # Placeholder logic; actual implementation would require more detailed analysis
            return 0.5  # Example: 50% inferred cooperation

    cooperation_rate = infer_cooperation()

    if round_number < 5:
        return 'C'  # Early rounds: cooperate to build trust

    threshold = capacity * (0.6 - (cooperation_rate / 2))
    threshold = max(threshold, capacity * 0.4)  # Minimum threshold

    if current_stock > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Consider defecting more in later rounds
        if round_number > total_rounds - 5:
            return 'D' if current_stock < (capacity * 0.75) else 'C'
        return 'D'

# Example usage:
# history = [(stock_t-1, action), ...]
# decision = strategy(history, stock_current, capacity, num_players)
```

**Alignment with Collective Mindset:**

ACT promotes a balance between individual and collective benefits by initially encouraging cooperation to sustain the resource. As rounds progress, it adaptively adjusts based on observed behavior and stock levels, aiming to prevent resource depletion while ensuring fair payoffs for all players.

---

This strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors by dynamically adjusting actions based on observable data and inferred cooperation rates. It prioritizes long-term sustainability without relying on explicit communication or coordination mechanisms.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_407 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a collective strategy that balances cooperation with adaptability to maintain resource sustainability. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

1. **Initial Rounds**: Players begin by Cooperating to build or maintain the stock level, setting a positive precedent.

2. **Threshold Calculation**: A dynamic threshold determines whether players Cooperate or Defect:
   - **Base Threshold**: Calculated as `(2 * current_stock) / capacity`.
   - **Adjusted Threshold**: Modified based on rounds remaining: `base_threshold * (1 - (current_round / total_rounds))`.

3. **Decision Rule**:
   - If the stock is above the adjusted threshold, players Cooperate.
   - If below, they Defect.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: The threshold adapts to prevent resource depletion and accounts for endgame effects as rounds progress.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, current_round, total_rounds):
    # Calculate base threshold considering stock relative to capacity
    base_threshold = (2 * stock) / capacity
    
    # Adjust threshold based on remaining rounds; lower threshold towards the end
    adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * (1 - (current_round / total_rounds))
    
    # Decision rule: Cooperate if stock is above the adjusted threshold, else Defect
    return 'C' if stock > adjusted_threshold else 'D'
```

### Strategy Justification

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with a cooperative stance to sustain resource levels and encourage mutual benefits.
- **Dynamic Thresholding**: Adjusts based on current stock and remaining rounds, preventing over-exploitation and adapting to endgame scenarios.
- **Adaptability**: Encourages players to switch strategies dynamically in response to changing conditions, fostering resilience against various opponent behaviors.

This strategy promotes a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability, aligning with the collective goal of preserving the common pool resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_408 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game aims to promote sustainable cooperation while adapting to changes in player behavior and resource levels. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by considering both historical cooperation rates and current stock levels. Here's the structured approach:

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets a positive precedent and helps maintain the initial high stock level.

2. **Last Round:**
   - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, Cooperate to ensure fair distribution.
   - Otherwise, Defect (D) to maximize immediate gains before the game ends.

3. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round (p).
   - Determine thresholds:
     - Threshold1 = 75% of capacity
     - Threshold2 = 25% of capacity

   - If current stock (S) > Threshold1:
     - Cooperate, as a high stock can sustain some defection.
   - Else if Threshold2 < S ≤ Threshold1:
     - If p > 60%, Cooperate to encourage continued cooperation.
     - Otherwise, Defect to avoid contributing to resource depletion.
   - Else (S ≤ Threshold2):
     - Defect, as the stock is too low to sustain further cooperation.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to start positively.
- **Last Round:** Cooperate if possible to maintain fairness; otherwise, defect for immediate gain.
- **Stock Collapse:** If the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 25% capacity), players switch to Defecting to salvage remaining resources.

### Pseudocode:
```python
def decision(current_stock, previous_round_actions):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = game_capacity()
    
    # First round: Cooperate
    if is_first_round():
        return 'C'
    
    # Last round: Decide based on current stock
    if is_last_round():
        threshold_last = 0.5 * capacity
        if current_stock > threshold_last:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # Calculate proportion of Cooperators in the previous round
    p = sum(1 for action in previous_round_actions if action == 'C') / n
    
    # Define thresholds
    threshold1 = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold2 = 0.25 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > threshold1:
        return 'C'
    elif threshold2 < current_stock <= threshold1:
        if p > 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # current_stock <= threshold2
        return 'D'
```

### Summary:
This strategy promotes cooperation when the stock is healthy and there's a history of mutual cooperation, adapting to switch to defection when necessary to prevent resource collapse. It balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors in a repeated game setting.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to be adaptive, starting with cooperation and adjusting based on observed behavior and resource levels. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Adaptation Based on Behavior**:
   - Calculate total consumption from previous rounds to estimate others' actions.
   - If most players are Cooperating, continue to Cooperate.
   - If significant Defection is detected, switch to Defecting.
3. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last few rounds (e.g., last 2), increase tendency to Defect to maximize individual payoffs without concern for future impacts.
4. **Stock Level Consideration**:
   - Cooperate if stock levels are above a threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity).
   - Consider switching to Defect if stock is low to either prevent further depletion or exploit others' cooperation.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the average consumption per player from past rounds.
   - If the average is close to the Cooperate level, continue Cooperating.
   - If the average suggests significant Defection (e.g., above a threshold), switch to Defecting.
3. **Last Few Rounds**: Increase tendency to Defect to maximize payoffs.
4. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - Cooperate if stock is above 80% of capacity.
   - Consider Defecting if stock drops below this threshold.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(history, current_round):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = game_capacity()
    r = total_rounds()

    # First round: Cooperate
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Calculate average consumption in previous rounds
    prev_consumption = sum([sum(round_actions) for round_actions in history])
    avg_cons_per_player = prev_consumption / (n * (current_round - 1))

    # Determine cooperation level from others
    cooperate_threshold = capacity / (2 * n)
    defect_threshold = capacity / n

    if avg_cons_per_player < (cooperate_threshold + defect_threshold) / 2:
        current_action = 'C'
    else:
        current_action = 'D'

    # Adjust for stock levels
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity and current_action == 'D':
        current_action = 'C'
    elif current_stock < 0.6 * capacity and current_action == 'C':
        current_action = 'D'

    # Endgame adjustment: Last few rounds
    if (r - current_round) <= 2:
        return 'D'

    return current_action
```

### Summary:
This strategy begins with cooperation to foster a positive environment, adapts based on observed consumption patterns, and adjusts in the endgame to maximize payoffs. By considering stock levels, it ensures sustainability while responding to potential defection, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_410 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances cooperation with defection based on historical behavior and resource levels, aiming to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining sustainability. Here's a structured outline:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating to encourage others to do the same and maintain a stable resource level.
2. **Monitor Behavior and Stock**: Track the proportion of Defectors in previous rounds (D_rate) and current stock levels.
3. **Adaptive Switching**:
   - If D_rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%) over recent rounds, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.
   - If stock is critically low (below a set level), Defect to maximize immediate gains.
4. **Recovery and Forgiveness**: After Defecting, if the stock recovers sufficiently, revert to Cooperating to sustain future benefits.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a positive trend.
   - **Last Round**: Defect to maximize payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, round_number):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    threshold_defectors = 0.3  # 30% defect rate triggers switch
    critical_stock_level = capacity * 0.7  # Example critical level
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate the proportion of Defectors in previous rounds
    recent_rounds = history[-window_size:] if len(history) > window_size else history
    d_rate = sum(1 for hist in recent_rounds if hist['D_count'] / n > threshold_defectors)
    average_d_rate = d_rate / len(recent_rounds) if recent_rounds else 0
    
    # Check current stock level
    if current_stock < critical_stock_level:
        return 'D'
    
    # Determine action based on Defection rate
    if average_d_rate > threshold_defectors:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
    
    # Handle last round separately
    if round_number == r:
        return 'D'
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust thresholds for D_rate and stock levels based on observed game dynamics.
- **Hysteresis**: Prevent frequent switching by requiring significant changes before altering strategy.
- **Memory Mechanism**: Use a moving average of past behavior to avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuations.

This strategy aims to foster cooperation when beneficial while defending against exploitation, ensuring adaptability across diverse opponent behaviors and game conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_411 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate in the first 2-3 rounds to encourage a sustainable resource level and set a positive example for other players.

2. **Monitoring Parameters**:
   - **Stock Level**: Track the current stock relative to capacity. Use two thresholds: low (40% of capacity) and high (60% of capacity).
   - **Cooperation Rate**: Calculate the average cooperation rate over the last 3-5 rounds to assess collective behavior.

3. **Decision Rules**:
   - **High Cooperation Scenario**: If the stock is above 60% of capacity and the cooperation rate exceeds 70%, continue Cooperating to maintain a healthy resource.
   - **Low Cooperation or Stock Crisis**: If the stock drops below 40% or the cooperation rate falls below 50%, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.
   - **Intermediate Cases**: Adjust based on others' behavior. If the cooperation rate is above 60%, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to promote a positive start.
   - **Last Round (if known)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.

5. **Collective Mindset**: Aim for mutual cooperation to sustain the resource, adapting to collective behavior and stock health to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

**Pseudocode Outline**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock, capacity, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate recent cooperation rate (last 3 rounds)
        recent_history = history[-3:]
        cooperation_rate = sum(1 for action in recent_history.values() 
                              for a in action.values() if a == 'C') / (n * len(recent_history))
        
        stock_threshold_low = 0.4 * capacity
        stock_threshold_high = 0.6 * capacity
        
        # Decision logic
        if stock > stock_threshold_high and cooperation_rate > 0.7:
            return 'C'
        elif stock < stock_threshold_low or cooperation_rate < 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Intermediate case: Cooperate if others are mostly Cooperating
            if cooperation_rate > 0.6:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

This strategy balances between maintaining the resource when feasible and defecting to prevent collapse, adapting dynamically based on stock levels and collective behavior.

To design a robust and adaptive collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to consider both immediate payoffs and long-term sustainability.

### **1. Decision Rules**

#### **Initial Rounds**
- **Action**: Cooperate (C)
  - Rationale: Starting with Cooperation builds a foundation for future collaboration and helps maintain or increase the stock level, which is crucial in the early rounds.

#### **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2)**
- **Cooperate** if:
  1. Current stock `S` is above a dynamic threshold (`T`).
  2. In the previous round, more than half of the players Cooperated.
- **Defect** otherwise.

#### **Last Few Rounds (Last 2 or 3 rounds)**
- **Defect** if:
  - The current stock `S` divided by `n` is greater than `S/(2n)` (i.e., defecting yields a higher immediate payoff).
- **Cooperate** otherwise to maintain any remaining stock.

---

### **2. Dynamic Threshold Calculation**

The threshold `T` is dynamically adjusted based on the stock's historical trends and recent behavior:

```
threshold = max(
    0.5 * capacity,
    min(capacity, 0.9 * (average_stock_over_last_3_rounds))
)
```

- This ensures that cooperation continues when the stock is healthy but allows for adaptation if the stock starts to deplete.

---

### **3. Adaptation Mechanisms**

#### **Stock Trend Analysis**
- Track the average stock level over the last 5 rounds.
- If the trend shows a significant decrease (e.g., by more than 10%), increase defection likelihood to exploit remaining resources before they're gone.

#### **Opponent Behavior Monitoring**
- Calculate the percentage of Cooperators in recent rounds.
- If cooperation is prevalent, continue Cooperating to sustain higher stock levels.
- If defection increases, adapt by defecting more frequently to prevent excessive resource depletion.

---

### **4. Edge Cases Handling**

#### **First Round (Round 1)**
- Always Cooperate to encourage others and build a sustainable resource base.

#### **Last Round (Round r)**
- Defect if the current stock allows for a higher immediate payoff (`S/n > S/(2n)`).
- Otherwise, Cooperate to maintain any remaining resources.

---

### **5. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, capacity, historical_stock, prev_actions):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    
    # Initial Round: Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate dynamic threshold
    recent_avg = average(historical_stock[-5:]) if len(historical_stock) >= 5 else capacity / 2
    threshold = max(0.5 * capacity, min(capacity, 0.9 * recent_avg))
    
    # Determine opponent cooperation rate in previous round
    coop_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    majority_coop = (coop_count / n) > 0.5
    
    # Middle Rounds: Cooperate based on threshold and opponent behavior
    if round_number < r - 2:
        if current_stock >= threshold and majority_coop:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # Last Few Rounds: Balance between exploitation and sustainability
    else:
        # Immediate payoff comparison
        immediate_payoff_defect = current_stock / n
        immediate_payoff Cooperate = current_stock / (2 * n)
        
        if immediate_payoff_defect > immediate_payoff_cooperate:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

---

### **6. Strategy Summary**

- **Early Rounds**: Prioritize cooperation to build and maintain stock levels.
- **Middle Rounds**: Use a dynamic threshold and monitor opponent behavior to decide between Cooperate or Defect, encouraging sustainability when possible.
- **Late Rounds**: Shift towards defection if it yields higher immediate payoffs, balancing exploitation with any remaining resource potential.

This strategy adaptively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, aligning with a collective mindset while being robust against varying opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_413 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that encourages cooperation while adapting to potential exploitation. Here's the organized solution:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy aims to promote long-term sustainability by defaulting to cooperation but switching to defecting when the resource is overexploited. This balance ensures individual gains without depleting the common pool.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Default Cooperation:**
   - Players start with Cooperate (C) in the first round and subsequent rounds if the stock remains above a critical threshold, promoting sustainable use.
   
2. **Defect Threshold:**
   - If the current stock falls below 30% of capacity, players switch to Defect (D). This indicates potential overuse, prompting immediate gain maximization before resource collapse.

3. **Transition Buffer Zone:**
   - Between 30-40% stock, players may alternate or use probabilistic choices (e.g., 50% chance to Cooperate/Defect) to encourage others to cooperate without causing instability.

### Edge Cases Handling:
1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent and contribute to sustainable stock levels.

2. **Last Few Rounds (Last 3 Rounds):**
   - Switch to Defect if the stock is above 50% to maximize immediate gains without concern for future sustainability, as there are no subsequent rounds.

### Implementation:
The strategy uses a state-dependent approach, monitoring the current stock and transitioning between cooperation and defecting based on predefined thresholds. This adaptability ensures the strategy remains robust against various opponent behaviors while maintaining collective sustainability goals.

### Pseudocode:
```python
def decide_action(stock_level, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to set a positive precedent

    # Check if the stock is critically low
    capacity = get_capacity()  # Assume this function returns the maximum sustainable level
    critical_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    high_stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity

    if stock_level < critical_threshold:
        return 'D'  # Defect to maximize immediate gains when resource is critically low
    elif round_number > total_rounds - 3 and stock_level > high_stock_threshold:
        return 'D'  # Defect in the last few rounds if stock is still high

    # If the stock is between critical threshold and a higher buffer zone, consider alternating or probabilistic choices
    buffer_low = 0.3 * capacity
    buffer_high = 0.4 * capacity
    if buffer_low < stock_level < buffer_high:
        # Alternate or use a probability to encourage cooperation without causing instability
        # For example, flip a coin between C and D
        return random.choice(['C', 'D'])
    
    # Otherwise, cooperate
    return 'C'
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy effectively balances individual gain with collective sustainability by defaulting to cooperation but switching to defecting when the resource is overexploited. It handles edge cases like the first and last rounds appropriately, ensuring adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_414 = '''
To address the problem of sustainably managing a shared resource through cooperative behavior while adapting to potential exploitation and endgame scenarios, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold-Based Defection

1. **Initial Phase (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - *Rationale:* Starting with cooperation when the stock is at capacity ensures sustainability and maintains resource levels for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds (From round 2 to r - k):**
   a. **Check Current Stock:**
      - If current stock \( S \geq T \) (where \( T = 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \)), proceed.
      - *Rationale:* Cooperating when the stock is above half capacity helps sustain resource levels through balanced consumption and replenishment.

   b. **Assess Recent Defection Rates:**
      - Look back at the last \( l = 3 \) rounds.
      - Calculate the percentage of defects among other players' actions in these rounds.
      - If the defection rate is less than \( p = 20\% \), continue to cooperate.
      - *Rationale:* Low defection rates indicate others are also cooperating, maintaining trust and sustainability.

   c. **Decision Based on Assessments:**
      - If both conditions (high stock and low defection) are met, **cooperate**.
      - Otherwise, **defect**.
        - *Rationale:* Switching to defecting when either the resource is low or others are exploiting prevents being exploited further.

3. **Endgame Phase (Last \( k = 3 \) Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - *Rationale:* In the final rounds, defecting maximizes individual payoff since there's no future punishment for defection, and cooperation may not yield significant returns.

### Parameters:
- **\( T = 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \):** Threshold stock level above which cooperation is sustained.
- **\( l = 3 \):** Number of recent rounds to assess defection rates.
- **\( p = 20\%: \)** Defection rate threshold; if exceeded, switch to defecting.
- **\( k = 3 \):** Last three rounds where defection is optimal regardless of other factors.

### Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Cooperate as the stock is high and initial cooperation helps maintain sustainability.
- **Last Rounds (Endgame):** Defect to maximize immediate payoffs, acknowledging limited future consequences.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Continue cooperating to sustain resource levels.
- **Stock Near Zero:** Defect to exploit remaining resources before potential collapse.

### Conclusion:
This strategy balances sustaining cooperation for mutual benefit while protecting against exploitation, especially towards the end of the game. It dynamically adapts based on current stock levels and recent history of others' behavior, ensuring robustness across various scenarios without relying on coordination with other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_415 = '''
**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over all rounds by balancing immediate gains and long-term sustainability of the common pool.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

- **Cooperate (C):**
  - When the current stock is above a dynamically adjusted threshold.
  - Encourages sustainable use, promoting growth for future rounds.

- **Defect (D):**
  - When the current stock is below the threshold or when the observed defection rate is high.
  - Maximizes immediate payoff while protecting against resource depletion.

---

### **2. Threshold Adjustment**

- **Initial Threshold:** Set to 75% of capacity, ensuring a buffer for growth and sustainability.
  
- **Dynamic Adjustment:**
  - Track the proportion of defects in each round.
  - Lower the threshold if defection rates increase, encouraging more defection to prevent rapid depletion.
  - Keep or raise the threshold if cooperation is prevalent, promoting sustainable use.

---

### **3. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to test sustainability and encourage others to follow suit.
  
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of rounds):**
  - Increase likelihood of defecting due to reduced future payoff considerations.
  - However, continue to prioritize sustainability if possible to maintain resource levels.

---

### **4. Adaptation Mechanism**

- Use a moving average of defection rates from previous rounds to adjust the threshold smoothly.
- Incorporate a smoothing factor to prevent drastic changes in strategy and avoid oscillations between cooperation and defection.

---

### **5. Implementation Steps**

1. **Initialize Parameters:**
   - Set initial threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
   - Define minimum and maximum thresholds for stability.

2. **First Round Action:** Cooperate to encourage sustainable play.

3. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. Calculate the current stock.
   b. Determine if it's above or below the adjusted threshold.
   c. Choose action (C/D) based on the decision rules.
   d. Update defection rate tracker and adjust the threshold for next rounds.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment:** Gradually increase likelihood of defecting while considering remaining rounds to balance immediate gains and sustainability.

---

### **6. Example Scenarios**

- **All Cooperate:** Stock remains stable, promoting long-term growth.
- **High Defection Rate:** Threshold lowers, encouraging more defection to prevent resource crash.
- **Mixed Strategies:** Adjust based on observed behavior; cooperate if sustainable, defect if stock is threatened.

---

**Summary:** This strategy dynamically balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and historical opponent behaviors. By adjusting thresholds and adapting over time, it aims to maximize payoffs while preserving the common pool resource for sustained benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_416 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation**

The strategy balances individual gain with the sustainability of the common pool resource by dynamically adjusting between cooperation and defection based on the current state of the stock.

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above a dynamic threshold, which is initially set at 50% of capacity.
   - Defect otherwise.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - After each round, update the threshold based on whether the stock increased or decreased.
     - If the stock after growth exceeds the previous round's stock, increase the threshold slightly (e.g., +10%) to encourage more cooperation.
     - If the stock decreases below the previous round's level, decrease the threshold slightly (e.g., -10%) to allow more defection.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to contribute to a healthy initial stock.
   - **Last Round (if known):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

4. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy aims for sustainable resource use by Cooperating when resources are sufficient and adapting to prevent over-depletion.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def determine_action(stock, capacity, history):
    # Initialize threshold if first round
    if not history:
        threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    else:
        last_stock = history[-1]['stock_after']
        growth_impact = stock - last_stock
        if growth_impact > 0:
            threshold *= 1.1  # Increase threshold to encourage cooperation
        else:
            threshold *= 0.9  # Decrease threshold to allow more defection

    if stock >= threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy adaptively responds to the resource's state, promoting sustainability while allowing for adjustments based on past outcomes.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_417 = '''
The designed collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is structured to encourage sustainable cooperation while adapting to potential defection. The approach balances immediate payoffs with long-term resource management.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round:** Cooperate in the first round to foster a cooperative environment and maintain the resource.
2. **Monitoring and History Tracking:** Keep track of each player's actions (Cooperate or Defect) from previous rounds, focusing on recent history for responsiveness.
3. **Cooperation Rate Calculation:** Compute the average cooperation rate among all players over the last few rounds (e.g., 3-5 rounds).
4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - If the cooperation rate is above a threshold (initially set at 70%), continue Cooperating to sustain the resource.
   - If below, switch to Defecting for a limited number of rounds to incentivize others to return to cooperation.
5. **Stock-Based Adaptation:** Monitor the current stock level. If the stock is significantly low or not recovering, increase the likelihood of defecting to maximize immediate payoffs.
6. **Endgame Adjustment:** As rounds near the end (last 10% of total rounds), lower the cooperation threshold to prioritize short-term gains over resource sustainability.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Default to Cooperate to encourage mutual benefit.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Focus on immediate payoffs, adjusting strategies dynamically as future payoffs diminish.
- **Stock Collapse:** If stock is critically low, defect to salvage remaining resources before potential collapse.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
# Initialize strategy parameters
initial_cooperate = True
history_window = 5  # Number of past rounds to consider
cooperation_threshold = 0.7  # Initial threshold for cooperation rate
endgame_adjustment_rounds = 0.1 * r  # Rounds near the end where adjustments happen

def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate
    recent_history = history[-history_window:]
    total_players = n
    cooperate_count = sum(action.count('C') for action in recent_history)
    cooperation_rate = cooperate_count / (total_players * len(recent_history))
    
    # Adjust threshold if near endgame
    if round_number > r - endgame_adjustment_rounds:
        adjusted_threshold = max(cooperation_threshold - 0.2, 0.3)
    else:
        adjusted_threshold = cooperation_threshold
    
    # Check current stock health
    if current_stock < (capacity * 0.3):  # If stock is critically low
        return 'D'
    
    if cooperation_rate > adjusted_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Summary:
This strategy starts with cooperation, tracks recent behavior to maintain sustainability, and adapts by defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse. It balances immediate gains with long-term benefits, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors in the tournament setting.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

To address the complexities of the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy is designed to encourage cooperation while adapting to different player behaviors.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C) as there is no prior history, promoting a stable initial stock level for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Reciprocity (Tit-for-Tat)**: Observe the average cooperation rate of other players in the previous round.
     - If most players cooperated (above a 60% threshold), cooperate this round to sustain the stock.
     - If many defected, consider defecting (D) as retaliation to incentivize future cooperation.
   - **Stock Health**: Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If the stock is below 20% of capacity, prioritize cooperation (C) to allow regrowth and prevent further depletion.

3. **Last Few Rounds**:
   - Maintain cooperation to keep the stock stable for any remaining rounds, preventing sudden drops in payoff despite reduced future impact.

### Stock Monitoring Threshold:

- Use a threshold of 20% of the capacity. If the stock falls below this level, players should be more inclined to cooperate (C) to prevent further depletion and allow regrowth.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **All Players Defect**: The strategy would mirror defection, leading to continued defection. However, after experiencing low payoffs, some players might switch back to cooperation.
- **Mix of Cooperators and Defectors**: The strategy encourages more cooperation over time by rewarding it through reciprocity.

### Summary:

This adaptive Tit-for-Tat approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. By using reciprocity and monitoring stock health, the strategy adapts to different player behaviors while maintaining a collective benefit, fostering a feedback loop that encourages cooperation when beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_419 = '''
The proposed collective strategy involves each player making decisions based on both the current stock level and the recent cooperation rates of others. The goal is to maintain sustainable Cooperation by Cooperating when resources are abundant and past Cooperation has been high, while allowing for Defection when necessary to prevent resource depletion.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Round (t=1):**
   - Since the game starts with the stock at capacity, all players default to Cooperate.
   - This ensures maximum growth in the first round and sets a positive precedent for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t>1):**
   - Each player evaluates two factors:
     - **Current Stock Level (S_current):** Is S_current above 80% of capacity?
     - **Recent Cooperation Rate:** In the previous round, did at least 75% of players Cooperate?

3. **Decision Rule:**
   - If both conditions are met (S_current ≥ 80% and prev_coop_rate ≥ 75%), the player Cooperates.
   - Otherwise, the player Defects.

4. **Adjustments for Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, there's no prior cooperation data, so all players default to C.
   - In later rounds, if Cooperation drops below 75%, players may start defecting, potentially leading to higher total consumption and lower stock levels in subsequent rounds.

**Rationale:**

- **Maintaining High Stock Levels:** By Cooperating when resources are abundant (S ≥ 80%), players ensure sustainable growth and prevent rapid depletion.
- **Encouraging Sustained Cooperation:** The requirement for high recent cooperation rates (≥75%) reinforces mutual interest in maintaining a healthy resource base, discouraging unilateral Defection.
- **Adaptability:** The strategy adapts dynamically based on current conditions, allowing for adjustments if Cooperation falters or resources dwindle.

This approach aims to balance individual payoffs with collective sustainability, promoting a stable equilibrium where Cooperation is the norm unless threatened by insufficient resources or low cooperation rates.

description_COLLECTIVE_420 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff over r rounds while balancing immediate gains and long-term resource sustainability.

**Structure:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative baseline to encourage others and sustain the resource for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Parameters:**
     - Stock level relative to capacity.
     - Average cooperation rate of other players.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If stock is above 80% of capacity and average cooperation rate among others exceeds 70%, continue Cooperating.
     - If stock drops below 80% or average cooperation rate falls below 70%, switch to Defecting more frequently to maximize current gains.

3. **Later Rounds (Last 2-3):**
   - **Action:** Increase defection rate
   - **Rationale:** Focus on immediate gains as the game nears its end, taking advantage of what's left before it depletes.

**Adaptation and Adjustments:**

- **Threshold Monitoring:** Implement thresholds for stock level (e.g., 80%) and cooperation rate (e.g., 70%). Adjust actions based on crossings of these thresholds.
- **Randomness Element:** Introduce slight randomness in strategy to avoid synchronized defection with other players, which could lead to quicker resource depletion.
- **Sustainability Consideration:** While defecting more can boost short-term payoffs, maintain a balance to prevent precipitous drops in stock that harm long-term gains.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate due to lack of historical data.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Shift towards Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources before the game ends.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior, resource levels, and game progression, aiming to optimize both individual payoffs and collective sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_421 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative norm early on to encourage others and build a healthy stock level.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Decision Rules:**
     a. **Current Stock Threshold:** If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, cooperate.
     b. **Recovery Rate (R):** Calculate as the growth rate from the previous round's stock to the current stock. If R is positive and indicates healthy recovery, continue cooperating.
     c. **Defection History:** Track defection rates over recent rounds. If more than 50% of players defected in the last k rounds, consider defecting to signal dissatisfaction with cooperation levels.

3. **Later Rounds (Approaching the End):**
   - **Action:** Defect if approaching the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%) as there's less incentive to preserve the resource for non-existent future rounds.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff with no future rounds.
   - **Very Low Stock (below 25% of capacity):** Defect, as higher immediate payoffs are prioritized despite risks.

5. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Use a moving average of stock levels and defection rates to adjust cooperation thresholds adaptively.
   - If recovery is poor or defection rates are high, increase the threshold for cooperation to encourage others to preserve the resource.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
for each round in r rounds:
    if current_round == 1:
        choose C
    elif current_round == last_round:
        choose D
    else:
        S = current_stock
        R = calculate_recovery_rate()
        D_count = count_defectors_in_previous_k_rounds(k)
        
        threshold_S = capacity * 0.75
        
        if S > threshold_S and R > 0:
            choose C
        elif D_count / n > 0.5:
            choose D
        else:
            choose D based on stock recovery and defection history

function calculate_recovery_rate():
    return (current_stock - previous_stock) / capacity

def count_defectors_in_previous_k_rounds(k):
    count = sum of defectors in last k rounds
    return count
```

**Conclusion:**

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation based on current stock levels, recovery rates, and historical defection patterns. It is robust against various opponent behaviors and adapts to different game parameters, aiming to maximize collective payoffs while preserving the resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_422 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability in a dynamic environment, we propose a strategic approach that adapts based on current conditions. Here is the structured solution:

### Approach
The strategy involves:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to build or maintain the stock without risking early collapse.
2. **Dynamic Defection Threshold**: Use a threshold-based system where defection occurs if the current stock exceeds 75% of capacity and has been consistently high over recent rounds, indicating that others are also managing consumption sustainably.
3. **Adaptive Adjustment**: Dynamically adjust the defecting threshold based on recent trends; increase it when the stock is rising (indicating effective cooperation) and decrease it when the stock is falling to encourage more cooperation.

### Solution Code
```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []
        self.capacity = None
        self.threshold = 0.75  # Default threshold as a fraction of capacity

    def get_action(self, current_stock, num_players):
        if not self.capacity:
            self.capacity = current_stock  # Initial assumption; might need adjustment
        
        if len(self.history) == 0:  # First round
            action = 'cooperate'
        else:
            # Calculate average of past few rounds (e.g., last 3)
            recent_stocks = self.history[-3:] if len(self.history)>=3 else self.history
            avg_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks) if recent_stocks else current_stock
            
            # Check if current stock is above threshold and average is increasing
            if (current_stock > self.capacity * self.threshold and 
                all(s <= current_stock for s in recent_stocks)):
                action = 'defect'
            else:
                action = 'cooperate'
        
        self.history.append(current_stock)
        return action

# Example usage:
strategy = Strategy()
num_players = 4
current_stock = 100  # Initial state

for _ in range(5):
    action = strategy.get_action(current_stock, num_players)
    print(f"Current Stock: {current_stock}, Action: {action}")
    
    # Simulate consumption and growth (simplified)
    if action == 'cooperate':
        consumed = current_stock / (2 * num_players) * num_players
    else:
        consumed = current_stock / num_players * num_players
    
    remaining = max(current_stock - consumed, 0)
    growth = min(remaining * 2 * (1 - remaining / strategy.capacity), strategy.capacity - remaining)
    current_stock = remaining + growth
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to avoid early stock depletion.
- **Dynamic Threshold**: A threshold (75% of capacity) is used to determine when to defect. This threshold can be adjusted based on observed trends in stock levels over recent rounds.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: By monitoring the stock's performance, the strategy adapts: allowing more defection when the system is stable and encouraging cooperation when the stock is at risk.

This approach ensures that individual gains are maximized without compromising long-term sustainability, making it robust against varying player behaviors and environmental conditions.

2. **Dynamic Thresholding**: Adjust the willingness to defect based on the current stock relative to capacity and the number of remaining rounds.
3. **Feedback from History**: Use past stock levels and consumption patterns to inform decisions, ensuring adaptability.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a sustainable stock level.
- **Middle Rounds**: Calculate a threshold dynamically. If the current stock is above this threshold, defect; otherwise, cooperate.
- **Final Rounds**: Allow more defection as future rounds become less impactful.

### Threshold Calculation:
The threshold starts at 60% of capacity and increases as the game progresses towards the end. This adjustment allows players to maximize immediate gains without risking long-term depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent stock trend
    window = min(len(history), 5)
    recent_stocks = history[-window:]
    avg_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks) if recent_stocks else capacity
    
    # Base threshold starts at 60% of capacity and increases towards the end
    base_threshold = capacity * 0.6
    remaining_weight = (round_number / total_rounds)
    threshold_adjustment = capacity * 0.2 * remaining_weight
    dynamic_threshold = base_threshold + threshold_adjustment
    
    # Prevent over-adjustments; cap at 80% of capacity
    safe_upper_limit = capacity * 0.8
    adjusted_threshold = min(dynamic_threshold, safe_upper_limit)
    
    if stock > adjusted_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages sustainable use in early rounds.
- **Dynamic Thresholding**: Adjusts based on remaining rounds and observed trends, allowing controlled defection when safe.
- **Feedback from History**: Uses past data to refine decisions, ensuring adaptability to changing conditions.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, fostering mutual benefit by preserving the common pool resource.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation and Defection**

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability by adapting to current conditions and historical data.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Early Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Cooperate unconditionally to foster a cooperative environment and sustain the resource for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Stock Above 80% of Capacity:** Continue Cooperating to maintain sustainable levels.
   - **Stock Below 30% of Capacity:** Switch to Cooperating to allow regrowth and prevent depletion.
   - **Stock Between 30-80%:**
     - Check recent cooperation rates (last few rounds):
       - If more than 60% of players have Cooperated, continue Cooperating to sustain the balance.
       - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate payoff and avoid being exploited by defectors.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - Defect to maximize personal gains as there are no future rounds for retaliation or reward.

### Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Cooperate to maintain stability.
- **Critically Low Stock:** Cooperate to allow regrowth; defecting would risk permanent depletion.
- **Last Round:** Defect to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock, history):
    round_number = current_round
    total_rounds = r  # Total number of rounds

    early_phase = range(1, 4)  # First 2-3 rounds
    late_phase_start = max(total_rounds - 3, 1)  # Last 2-3 rounds

    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    coop_threshold = 0.6  # 60% cooperation rate

    if round_number in early_phase:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number >= late_phase_start:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if stock >= high_threshold:
            return 'C'
        elif stock <= low_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            recent_coop = proportion_of_cooperators(history, last_n_rounds=3)
            if recent_coop > coop_threshold:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Early Rounds:** Encourage cooperation to build a sustainable resource base.
- **Middle Phase:** Adjust actions based on stock levels and recent player behavior, promoting stability when possible and defecting to prevent exploitation.
- **Late Rounds:** Maximize immediate payoff by defecting as future rounds are no longer a concern.

This strategy is adaptive, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability while considering the collective dynamics of the game.

**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to encourage others and set a positive precedent.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Assess two key factors:
     - **Historical Cooperation Rate:** Calculate the proportion of cooperative actions from all players up to the current point.
     - **Current Stock Level:** Evaluate whether the stock is above a defined threshold, indicating sufficient sustainability.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - If both the historical cooperation rate exceeds 60% and the current stock level is above half of capacity, continue to Cooperate (C).
   - Otherwise, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff or respond to perceived exploitation.

4. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Defect (D) regardless of other factors, as there is no future beyond this round to preserve the stock for.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock_level, historical_cooperation_rate):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        cooperate_threshold = 0.6  # 60% cooperation rate
        stock_threshold = capacity / 2  # Half of the maximum sustainable level
        
        if (historical_cooperation_rate > cooperate_threshold and 
            stock_level > stock_threshold):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

**Rationale:**
- **Cooperation in the First Round:** Encourages a cooperative environment from the start.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability based on observed cooperation and resource levels.
- **Final Round Defection:** Maximizes payoff without concern for future rounds, preventing unnecessary stock preservation.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, encouraging cooperation while defending against exploitation, ensuring a balance between individual gain and collective resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_426 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for harvesting resources while considering regrowth, we analyze the behavior of cooperating versus defecting under different conditions. The key insights are as follows:

1. **Cooperating Behavior**: When all players cooperate, the resource stock increases over time because the growth rate compensates for consumption. This sustainable approach ensures long-term availability.

2. **Defecting Impact**: Defectors consume more resources, risking over-depletion. However, without information on others' strategies, defecting might offer short-term gains but risks future scarcity.

3. **Sustainable Yield**: Cooperating leads to a stable or increasing stock, making it optimal for long-term resource management. The model shows that cooperation sustains the resource, unlike defecting which can deplete it.

**Conclusion**: Always cooperate to ensure sustainable harvesting and prevent over-depletion.

\boxed{\text{Always Cooperate}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_427 = '''
To address the problem of sustainable resource management among players, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy involves:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Players start by cooperating to establish a stable resource base.
2. **Dynamic Threshold-Based Defection**: Except for the first and last rounds, players defect if the current stock exceeds a threshold (set at 50% of capacity) and cooperate otherwise. This helps prevent over-depletion while allowing for some exploitation.
3. **Final Round Maximization**: In the last round, all players defect to maximize their final payoff since there's no future punishment.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
current_round = t
total_rounds = r
capacity = C

if current_round == 1:
    action = 'C'
elif current_round == total_rounds:
    action = 'D'
else:
    if stock > 0.5 * capacity:
        action = 'D'
    else:
        action = 'C'
return action
```

This strategy aims to sustain the resource while allowing players to maximize their payoffs without causing irreversible depletion.

**Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate in the first round, defect if the stock exceeds 50% capacity in subsequent rounds (except the last), and defect in the final round.}}

description_COLLECTIVE_428 = '''
**Strategy Description: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock and Opponent Behavior**

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining sustainable use of the common pool resource. It adapts dynamically based on the current stock level and recent opponent behavior.

1. **Initial Round**: Always Cooperate to establish a baseline for sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Check**: 
     - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate to help preserve and regrow the resource.
     - If the stock is above 75%, consider Defecting if many opponents have been Cooperating recently.
   - **Opponent Behavior**:
     - Track the number of opponents who Defected in previous rounds. If more than half of opponents have been defecting frequently, increase tendency to Cooperate this round.
   - **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Adjust thresholds based on remaining rounds. In later rounds (last 10%), be slightly more lenient with Defecting but still prioritize preserving the stock.

3. **Last Few Rounds**: Be cautious about over-depletion; prioritize Cooperating to ensure moderate payoffs rather than risking high consumption that could deplete the stock for future rounds.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock, round_number, total_rounds, opponent_defect_history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = initial_stock
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        stock_threshold_low = 0.5 * capacity
        stock_threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
        
        defect_rate = sum(opponent_defect_history) / len(opponent_defect_history)
        
        # If stock is low, Cooperate to preserve
        if stock <= stock_threshold_low:
            return 'C'
        # If many opponents are defecting, Cooperate more
        elif defect_rate > 0.5:
            return 'C'
        # In later rounds, balance between harvesting and sustainability
        elif round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
            if stock > capacity * 0.9:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        # If stock is high and opponents are Cooperating, Defect
        elif stock > stock_threshold_high:
            if defect_rate < 0.3:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        # Default: Cooperate to maintain balance
        else:
            return 'C'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy starts by Cooperating in the first round to promote sustainability.
- It monitors the stock level and adjusts actions based on whether the stock is low (Cooperate) or high (consider Defecting).
- Opponent behavior is tracked; if many are defecting, it encourages more Cooperation to prevent further depletion.
- In later rounds, while still prioritizing Cooperation, there's a slight allowance for Defection when the stock is very high to balance immediate gains with sustainability.

This approach ensures adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors, aiming to maximize long-term payoff while maintaining resource levels.

description_COLLECTIVE_429 = '''
**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** To maximize collective payoffs while ensuring sustainable resource management over multiple rounds.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **Default Action:** Cooperate (C) in the first few rounds to build and maintain stock levels, promoting sustainability.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold Monitoring:**
     - **High Stock (Above 80% of Capacity):** Continue Cooperating (C) to sustain resource health.
     - **Moderate Stock (50%-80% of Capacity):** Maintain Cooperation (C) but remain vigilant. If many players Defect, consider switching strategies in subsequent rounds.
     - **Low Stock (Below 50% of Capacity):** Switch to Defecting (D) temporarily to reduce consumption pressure and allow the stock to recover.

3. **Later Rounds:**
   - As the game approaches the final few rounds (e.g., last 10%), consider adjusting strategies knowing there's no future impact beyond these rounds:
     - **Final Round(s):** Players might defect to maximize individual payoffs, understanding it won't affect subsequent rounds.

### Adaptive Feedback Loop:

- Each player independently assesses stock levels and recent consumption patterns. Adjustments are made based on the observed depletion rate and others' actions, encouraging a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.

### Edge Cases Handling:

1. **First Round:**
   - Default to Cooperate (C) to set a foundation for sustainable resource management.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Consider defecting (D) to maximize individual payoffs, recognizing the lack of future rounds to manage stock depletion.

3. **Stock Depletion:**
   - If stock drops significantly due to Defectors, switch to D temporarily to prevent further collapse and allow recovery in subsequent rounds.

### Summary:

- The strategy begins with Cooperation to sustain resources.
- It adapts based on dynamic thresholds (high, moderate, low stock levels) to balance individual gains against collective sustainability.
- As the game nears its end, players may shift towards Defecting to maximize final payoffs, understanding the trade-offs involved.

This approach encourages a balanced strategy that is adaptive and robust, aligning with the collective goal of maximizing total payoffs while managing resource depletion sustainably.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_430 = '''
The proposed strategy is designed to maximize payoffs by balancing cooperation for sustainable resource levels and defecting when necessary. It adapts based on the current stock level, round number, and recent player behavior.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Early Rounds (First 25% of total rounds):** Always Cooperate to build up the common pool and encourage others to do the same.
   
2. **Mid Game:** Monitor the proportion of cooperation among other players over the past few rounds. If a significant majority are cooperating, continue to cooperate; otherwise, defect.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 25% of total rounds):** Shift towards Defecting, especially if the stock is low or others have been defecting recently. However, maintain cooperation if the stock remains high and others are still cooperating.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to start sustainably.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Increase defection tendency as future rounds' potential for punishment diminishes.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, n, r, current_round, history):
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity  # Adjust based on game parameters if possible
    k = 3  # Number of recent rounds to consider
    p_threshold = 0.6  # Proportion of cooperation needed

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Check if it's late game (last quarter)
        if current_round > (3/4) * r:
            if stock_level < threshold:
                return 'D'
            else:
                recent_actions = history[-k:] if len(history) >= k else history
                coop_count = sum(1 for a in recent_actions if a == 'C')
                if (coop_count / len(recent_actions)) > p_threshold:
                    return 'C'
                else:
                    return 'D'
        else:
            # Mid game: check stock and recent cooperation
            if stock_level > threshold:
                recent_actions = history[-k:] if len(history) >= k else history
                coop_count = sum(1 for a in recent_actions if a == 'C')
                if (coop_count / len(recent_actions)) > p_threshold:
                    return 'C'
                else:
                    return 'D'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Early Rounds:** By always Cooperating, the strategy aims to maintain high stock levels, encouraging others to follow suit and sustain the resource.

- **Mid Game Adaptation:** The strategy monitors recent player actions. If a majority are Cooperating, it continues to do so; otherwise, it defects to prevent being exploited when others are not maintaining sustainability.

- **Late Rounds Adjustment:** As rounds approach the end, the focus shifts more towards defecting if the stock is low or if others have been defecting, as there's less incentive for future cooperation. However, it still Cooperates if the stock remains high and others maintain sustainable practices.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to different player behaviors while remaining robust without relying on specific coordination mechanisms.

**Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation and Defection Based on Sustainability**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage others to do the same, promoting a sustainable resource level.

2. **Monitor Stock Dynamics**: After each round, assess the stock level. Use this information to determine if cooperation is effective or if defection is becoming prevalent.

3. **Threshold for Switching**:
   - If the stock drops below 50% of capacity after several rounds, switch to defecting to maximize individual payoff before resource depletion.
   - Continue cooperating if the stock remains stable or recovers, maintaining sustainability.

4. **Adaptation Based on Player Behavior**: Track the number of players defecting. If over 50% of players are defecting, consider switching to defection to avoid being exploited and to maximize immediate gains.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
   - **Last Few Rounds**: Consider potential increases in defection as rounds conclude. Adjust strategy accordingly based on observed behavior and stock levels.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability, adapting dynamically to the game's evolving state and other players' actions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_432 = '''
To address the problem of devising a strategy for an AI agent in a repeated game where players can either Cooperate or Defect, we need to consider the dynamics of resource sustainability and immediate payoff maximization. The goal is to create a robust strategy that adapts based on the current state of the shared resource (stock) relative to its capacity.

### Approach
The proposed strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains by monitoring the stock level and adjusting actions accordingly. Key components include:

1. **First Round**: Start by Cooperating to encourage resource preservation.
2. **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.
3. **Intermediate Rounds**:
   - **High Threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity)**: Cooperate when the stock is above this level, as it indicates a sustainable state allowing for growth.
   - **Low Threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity)**: Defect when below this level to maximize immediate gain before further depletion.
   - **Between Thresholds**: Adjust based on whether the stock is increasing or decreasing. If the stock is increasing, Cooperate; if decreasing, Defect.

This approach incorporates hysteresis to prevent oscillations between actions due to minor fluctuations in stock levels.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        if current_stock > high_threshold:
            return "Cooperate"
        elif current_stock < low_threshold:
            return "Defect"
        else:
            # Assume we have access to previous stock levels; in reality, this would require tracking
            # For the sake of example, let's assume a trend is determined from historical data
            # This part requires additional state tracking which isn't shown here
            if determine_trend(current_stock):
                return "Cooperate"
            else:
                return "Defect"

def determine_trend(current_stock):
    # Simplified trend determination (in practice, this would track changes over time)
    # For example, compare current_stock with previous rounds' stocks
    # This is a placeholder for actual trend calculation logic
    return True  # Assuming an upward trend for demonstration

# Example usage:
total_rounds = 10
capacity = 100
stock_history = [100, 95, 87, 80, 72, 65, 60, 58, 63, 70]

for current_round in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    action = determine_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock_history[current_round - 1], capacity)
    print(f"Round {current_round}: Action is {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **First Round**: The strategy starts by Cooperating to promote a sustainable resource base.
- **Last Round**: Knowing there are no future rounds, the agent defects to maximize immediate payoff.
- **Intermediate Rounds**:
  - When the stock is above 80% of capacity, cooperation ensures continued sustainability.
  - Below 60%, defecting maximizes short-term gain as the resource is already being heavily used.
  - Between these thresholds, the strategy checks the trend of the stock. An increasing trend suggests others are Cooperating, encouraging continuation; a decreasing trend indicates potential Defection by others, prompting a switch to Defect.

This approach provides a balance between long-term sustainability and short-term gain optimization, adapting dynamically based on observed resource levels.

**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Strategy**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale**: Starting with cooperation encourages others to do the same, helping sustain the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision Rules**:
   - **Step 1: Assess Cooperation Level**:
     - Observe the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
     - Calculate the percentage of cooperators relative to total players (n).
   
   - **Step 2: Evaluate Stock Level**:
     - Check if the current stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity).

   - **Decision Making**:
     - If more than 50% of players cooperated and the stock is above 60%, choose to Cooperate (C).
     - Otherwise, choose to Defect (D).

3. **Stock Threshold Mechanism**:
   - If the current stock drops below 40% of capacity:
     - Temporarily switch strategy to always Cooperate (C) until the stock recovers above 60%.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment**:
   - In the last 10% of rounds, increase cooperation efforts to prevent a rush on resource exploitation.
     - Adjust the cooperation threshold to be more lenient, encouraging continued cooperation despite fewer future rounds.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Default to Cooperate (C).
   - **Low Stock Recovery**: Once stock exceeds 60%, revert to normal decision rules after a recovery phase of 3 rounds.
   - **Sudden Defection Surge**: If cooperation drops below 30% in a round, consider immediate defecting as a reactive measure.

**Pseudocode Representation**:

```python

            if history is empty:
                return 'C'
            else:
                last_round = history[-1]
                cooperators = sum(1 for action in last_round if action == 'C')
                coop_percentage = cooperators / n

                stock_threshold_low = 0.4 * capacity

                # Modified conditions for final rounds
                if (coop_percentage > 0.4 and current_stock >= stock_threshold_high) or (current_stock < stock_threshold_high):
                    return 'C'

                    return 'D'
        return decide_action
    else:
        return decide_action
```

**Explanation**:
- The strategy begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base.
- It adapts based on the previous round's actions and the current stock level, encouraging mutual cooperation when beneficial.
- A critical threshold ensures that if resources are severely depleted, all players switch to cooperating to aid recovery.
- Final rounds adjustments prevent a last-minute rush to exploit the resource, promoting continued cooperation for mutual benefit.

To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable harvest in a multi-player game where players can either Cooperate or Defect, we propose a strategy called "Sustainable Harvest." This strategy balances individual payoff maximization with the collective need to preserve the resource. The approach involves dynamic decision-making based on current stock levels and recent cooperation trends among players.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to help build or maintain the resource level.
2. **Observation**: In each subsequent round, observe the current stock level (S) and the proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round (C_prev).
3. **Decision Rules**:
   - If the current stock is above 60% of capacity and at least 70% of players Cooperated last round, continue Cooperating.
   - If the current stock drops below 40% of capacity or less than 30% of players Cooperated last round, switch to Defecting.
   - For intermediate cases, use a weighted decision where cooperation is more likely if recent cooperation has been above average and the stock is not too low.

### Solution Code
```python
def sustainable_harvest_strategy(current_stock, capacity, previous_cooperation):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if current_stock == None:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    T = 0.5 * capacity  # Target stock level for optimal growth
    S = current_stock
    C_prev = previous_cooperation
    
    # Decision thresholds
    high_c_threshold = 0.7
    low_c_threshold = 0.3
    high_s_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    low_s_threshold = 0.4 * capacity
    
    if S > high_s_threshold and C_prev >= high_c_threshold:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif S < low_s_threshold or C_prev <= low_c_threshold:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        # Weighted decision: favor Cooperate if cooperation was moderately high
        # and stock is not too low, else lean towards Defect
        if (C_prev > 0.5 * high_c_threshold) and (S >= 0.8 * T):
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Defect"

# Example usage:
current_stock = 400  # Example value, adjust as needed
capacity = 500       # Example capacity
previous_cooperation = 0.6  # Proportion of players who Cooperated last round

decision = sustainable_harvest_strategy(current_stock, capacity, previous_cooperation)
print(f"Decision: {decision}")
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The strategy starts with Cooperation to encourage a positive trend in resource levels.
- **Observation and Decision Making**: Each round, players assess the current stock level relative to an optimal target (50% of capacity) and the cooperation rate from the previous round. This dual assessment helps determine whether to Cooperate or Defect.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: The strategy adapts dynamically by adjusting its behavior based on current conditions. If the resource is healthy and most players are cooperating, it continues Cooperating. Conversely, if resources are low or cooperation is sparse, it switches to Defecting to maximize individual gains while preventing resource collapse.

This approach aims to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging collective action through responsive and adaptive decision-making.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_435 = '''
The strategy is designed to maintain cooperation when the resource stock is healthy, switch to defection if others start defecting too much, and handle edge cases like initial rounds and nearing game end.

**Final Answer:**

The collective strategy balances cooperation with defection based on current stock levels and past player actions. Here's a clear outline:

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish sustainability.
   - **Subsequent Rounds (excluding last few):**
     - If stock > 80% of capacity: Cooperate.
     - If stock < 60% of capacity: Defect.
     - Between 60% and 80%:
       - If over half defected last round: Defect.
       - Else: Cooperate.
   - **Last Few Rounds (10% or so):** Defect to maximize payoffs.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - Always cooperate in the first round.
   - Near game end, defect to capitalize on remaining rounds.

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   - Cooperate when resources are plentiful to sustain them.
   - Adapt to defection by defecting if necessary but aim to rebuild cooperation.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, previous_actions):
    # Initial round always cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate thresholds
    c_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    d_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    
    # Check stock against thresholds
    if current_stock > c_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < d_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Between thresholds, check previous round's defection rate
        num_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions[-1] if action == 'D')
        if num_defectors / len(previous_actions[-1]) > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    # Handle last few rounds (e.g., last 10%)
    if round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        return 'D'
```

This strategy adapts dynamically, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and switching to defection when necessary, ensuring robust performance across various game conditions.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize collective payoff by balancing immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability. It adapts dynamically based on current stock levels and historical player behavior.

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** When the stock level is above 80% of capacity (`S_high = 0.8 * capacity`), indicating a healthy resource base.
   - **Defect (D):** If the stock is below `S_high` and more than 30% of players have defected in past rounds, suggesting a need for caution.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to foster initial sustainability.
   - **Last Round:** Adjust based on stock level; Cooperate if high, else consider Defecting only if others are likely to do so.

3. **Adaptive Mechanisms:**
   - Use a moving average of past defection rates to avoid overreacting to short-term changes.
   - Dynamically adjust `S_high` based on stock recovery trends to prevent oscillations.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Monitor current stock and historical actions in each round.
   - Apply thresholds to decide between C and D, considering both stock level and past behavior.
   - Adjust strategy dynamically to respond to changing conditions without overreacting.

This approach ensures robust performance against diverse opponent strategies, promoting sustainability while adapting to real-time changes.

**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Threshold Collaboration (ATC)

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while preserving the common pool resource through adaptive cooperation and defection based on dynamic thresholds.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

- **Dynamic Thresholds:**
  - Set two thresholds, `Low` and `High`, based on current stock (`S`), where:
    - `Low = capacity / (2n)` (minimum safe level to avoid collapse)
    - `High = capacity / n` (maximum safe level for defection without causing significant depletion)

- **Action Decision:**
  - If `S >= High`: Defect (D) as the resource is abundant, and defection is safe.
  - If `Low < S < High`: Use a majority vote among players to decide action. If more than half of recent actions were cooperation, Cooperate; else, Defect.
  - If `S <= Low`: Cooperate (C) to prevent stock collapse.

- **Adaptive Adjustment:**
  - After each round, adjust thresholds based on observed stock growth and consumption patterns:
    - Increase `High` if stock consistently regrows despite defection.
    - Decrease `Low` if stock fails to recover after cooperation.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:**
  - Start with Defect (D) as the initial stock is at capacity, and defecting is safe without prior history.

- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of rounds):**
  - Force Cooperation (C) to ensure sustainable resource levels for any remaining rounds, preventing a sudden crash.

---

### **3. Collective Mindset Alignment**

The strategy aligns with the collective mindset by:

- Promoting long-term sustainability through adaptive cooperation when necessary.
- Encouraging defection only when safe and beneficial, thus avoiding unnecessary resource depletion.
- Using historical data and majority behavior to foster implicit coordination without explicit communication.

---

### **4. Implementation Notes**

- Track historical stock levels and player actions to dynamically adjust thresholds.
- Use a simple majority vote mechanism based on recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds) to decide cooperation or defection when in the intermediate threshold range.
- Regularly update thresholds after each round to respond to changing resource conditions.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def ATC_strategy(S, history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity

    # Calculate dynamic thresholds
    Low = capacity / (2 * n)
    High = capacity / n

    if S >= High:
        return 'D'
    elif S <= Low:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Use majority vote from history to decide action
        recent_actions = history[-5:]  # Last 5 rounds' actions
        cooperation_count = sum(1 for a in recent_actions if a == 'C')
        
        if cooperation_count > len(recent_actions) / 2:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

    # Adaptive adjustment of thresholds based on stock dynamics (to be implemented post-round)
```

---

**Conclusion:** The ATC strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on the resource's state and historical behavior. This adaptive approach aims to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining collective resource health, making it robust against diverse opponent strategies in the tournament.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_438 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining sustainable resource levels while balancing immediate payoffs, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both current stock conditions and past actions of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to preserve the initial high stock level.
2. **Monitor Consumption and Stock Levels**:
   - After each round, calculate total consumption (TC_prev) based on all players' actions.
   - Track changes in stock levels (Delta_S = S_current - S_prev).
3. **Detect Significant Defection**: Determine if others have been defecting by comparing TC_prev to the expected cooperation level (S_prev / 2). If TC_prev exceeds this by a significant margin, it indicates more defection.
4. **Adjust Based on Stock and Defection**:
   - Cooperate if current stock is above an ideal threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) and there's no significant defection.
   - Defect if the stock drops significantly or others are defecting, to signal the consequences of defection and maximize immediate payoffs.

### Detailed Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
   - Cooperate in the first round to maintain a high initial stock level.
2. **Each Subsequent Round**:
   a. **Calculate Total Consumption (TC_prev)**:
      - For each player, if they Cooperated, add S_prev / (2n) to TC_prev; if Defected, add S_prev / n.
   b. **Determine Stock Change**: Compute Delta_S = S_current - S_prev.
   c. **Check for Significant Defection**:
      - Compare TC_prev with the expected cooperation level (S_prev / 2).
      - If TC_prev > S_prev / 2 + buffer, significant defection is detected.
   d. **Decision Logic**:
      - **Cooperate**: If current stock > 80% of capacity and no significant defection.
      - **Defect**: Otherwise, especially if Delta_S < 0 or significant defection is detected.

### Conclusion
This strategy aims to maintain high stock levels by defaulting to cooperation while adaptively defecting when necessary. By monitoring both stock trends and others' actions, it balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Moves):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to build a sustainable resource base and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock and Player Actions:**
     - Track stock levels after each round.
     - Observe how many players are defecting versus cooperating.
   - **Decision Rules Based on Stock Level:**
     - If the stock remains above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) despite others defecting, consider defecting to gain immediate payoffs without causing resource collapse.
     - If the stock is below this threshold, increase cooperation to preserve the resource for future rounds.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3 Moves):**
   - **Adjust Based on Current Stock:**
     - If the stock is high, consider defecting more to gain larger immediate payoffs since there are fewer future rounds.
     - If the stock is low, cooperate to allow some recovery and prevent resource collapse.

4. **Adaptation and Learning:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level and other players' actions each round.
   - Adjust strategy dynamically based on the latest data to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round Default Action:** Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
   - **Stock Collapse Scenario:** If the stock is very low, prioritize cooperation to allow recovery and sustain future rounds.

6. **Collective Good Considerations:**
   - Ensure the strategy promotes mutual sustainability without exploiting others.
   - Be robust against varying player behaviors, encouraging collective preservation of resources.

This strategy balances short-term exploitation with long-term conservation, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and past interactions to maximize collective payoffs over multiple rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_440 = '''
The optimal strategy for balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in the context of repeated interactions without coordination is as follows:

**Cooperative Harvesting Strategy:**

1. **Threshold-Based Cooperation:**
   - **Defect** when the current stock (S) is above 80% of capacity and there's been a history of cooperation in recent rounds.
   - **Cooperate** when S drops below 80% or if there has been significant defection recently, to allow the resource to recover.

2. **Adaptation to Historical Behavior:**
   - Monitor past actions and payoffs to assess whether other players have been defecting excessively.
   - Shift towards cooperation if recent rounds show a pattern of low stock due to widespread defection.

3. **Risk Management:**
   - Avoid simultaneous defection at high S levels by considering the likelihood of others' actions based on historical data.
   - Use a dynamic threshold that adjusts according to past trends in resource depletion and recovery.

This strategy aims to prevent collapse by encouraging cooperation when necessary, while still allowing for defection to maximize gains under safe conditions. It balances immediate benefits with the need to sustain resources for future rounds, adapting dynamically to changing circumstances.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_441 = '''
The optimal strategy for maximizing individual payoff while considering the common resource's sustainability can be outlined as follows:

1. **Cooperation Phase**: When the stock level is above 75% of its maximum capacity (C), each player should cooperate by consuming an amount equal to C/(2n) per round. This ensures sustainable use of the resource, allowing it to replenish adequately between rounds.

2. **Defection Phase**: If the stock level drops below 75% of C, players should switch to defecting by consuming as much as possible (i.e., S/n per player). This phase aims to maximize immediate gain when the resource is critically low, potentially leading to a collapse if not addressed.

**Rationale**:
- **Cooperation**: By limiting consumption to C/(2n), each player contributes to maintaining the stock's health. The total consumption remains at 50% of capacity (C/2), ensuring that the resource can regenerate sufficiently.
  
- **Defection**: When the stock is low, defecting allows individuals to secure as much of the remaining resource as possible before it potentially depletes entirely.

This strategy balances between long-term sustainability and short-term gains, though it carries a risk of abrupt collapse if the stock drops below the threshold. It serves as a heuristic approach that simplifies decision-making under uncertainty regarding others' strategies.

**Final Answer**: The optimal strategy is to cooperate when the stock is above 75% of its maximum capacity and defect otherwise. This can be succinctly expressed as:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S \geq 0.75C, \text{ else Defect}}$

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment**

The strategy aims to maintain a sustainable common pool resource by balancing immediate gains with long-term benefits. It employs adaptive behavior based on stock levels and historical actions, incorporating mechanisms to punish defection and encourage cooperation.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to promote a stable resource level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Cooperation Level Adjustment:** Monitor the stock and the proportion of Cooperators in previous rounds. If the stock is healthy (>75% of capacity) and most players Cooperated, continue Cooperating.
   - **Switch to Defecting:** If the stock drops below 60% of capacity or more than 40% of players Defected in the last round, switch to Defecting to signal dissatisfaction and encourage others to Cooperate.
3. **Forgiveness Mechanism:** After Defecting, revert to Cooperating if the stock stabilizes above 70% and cooperation levels improve over three consecutive rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Round (Round r):** If historical cooperation is high (>60%), Cooperate; otherwise, Defect to maximize individual payoff without future consequences.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def strategy(current_stock, history):
    n = number_of_players
    round_number = len(history) + 1

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation levels and stock trends
    recent_coops = sum(1 for action in history[-3:] if action == 'C') / (n * 3)
    stock_trend = current_stock - history['stock'][-1] if len(history['stock']) > 0 else 0

    # Decision criteria
    if recent_coops > 0.6 and current_stock >= capacity * 0.7:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < capacity * 0.6 or (1 - recent_coops) > 0.4:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Revert to Cooperate if stock improves
        if stock_trend > 0 and any(action == 'C' for action in history[-3:]):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Handle last round differently
if round_number == r:
    if recent_coops > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Strategy Explanation:

- **Adaptive Cooperation:** The strategy adapts based on the current stock level and the cooperation observed in previous rounds. It promotes sustainability by Cooperating when conditions are favorable.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** By switching to Defecting when the resource is threatened or when many players defect, it signals the need for cooperation and discourages future defection.
- **Forgiveness:** After punishing Defectors, if cooperation resumes and the stock recovers, the strategy reverts to Cooperating to sustain the resource.

This approach ensures a balance between individual payoffs and collective sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors in repeated interactions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_443 = '''
To address the challenge effectively, we propose a strategy that encourages cooperation when both the resource (stock) is healthy and past cooperation levels are sufficient. This approach aims to sustain the resource while preventing exploitation by those who might defect.

**Strategy:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating in the first round to establish a foundation for maintaining the resource.
2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision Making:**
   - **Cooperation Conditions:** In each subsequent round, Cooperate if both:
     - The current stock is above 50% of its capacity.
     - More than half of the players Cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Defection Otherwise:** If either condition is not met, Defect to avoid exploitation and prevent further resource depletion.

**Rationale:**

- **Resource Health:** By requiring the stock to be above 50% of its capacity, we ensure that cooperation contributes to maintaining a sustainable level of resources.
- **Past Cooperation:** Checking that more than half of players Cooperated in the previous round ensures that cooperation is mutual and not one-sided, thus preventing exploitation.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider a game with `n=4` players and a stock capacity of 100. If all players follow this strategy:

- **Round 1:** All Cooperate. Each gets a payoff of 25 (from 100/(2*4) = 12.5, but assuming total consumption is 50).
- **Stock Management:** The stock remains healthy, allowing continued cooperation in subsequent rounds.

If one player defects:

- **Round t:** Three Cooperate, one Defects. Total consumption is 3*(100/8)=37.5 + 25=62.5.
- **Stock Recovery:** The remaining stock after consumption allows for growth, leading to a healthy stock in the next round if cooperation continues.

**Conclusion:**

This strategy balances maintaining the resource with preventing exploitation by ensuring mutual cooperation and healthy resource levels. It promotes sustainable play while adapting to changes in player behavior.

**Answer:**

To implement this strategy, players will Cooperate in the first round and continue Cooperating in subsequent rounds only if both conditions are met:

1. The current stock is above 50% of its capacity.
2. More than half of the players Cooperated in the previous round.

Otherwise, they will Defect.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; subsequently Cooperate only if the stock is above 50% and more than half Cooperated last round, else Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_444 = '''
To design a robust strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we balance cooperation for sustainability with defection when necessary. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating to build trust and sustain the common pool.
2. **Monitor Behavior and Stock Levels:** Track the number of defects and stock levels over rounds.
3. **Adaptive Defection:** If defects are high (e.g., >50%) and the stock significantly decreases, switch to defecting temporarily.
4. **Sustainability Check:** Continue cooperating if the stock remains stable or recovers despite some defects.
5. **Final Round Adjustment:** In the last round, prioritize immediate payoff by defecting unless cooperation maintains a decent return.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Encourage others to cooperate and maintain the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step A: Assess Previous Round's Defects**
     - Calculate the proportion of defects from the previous round.
   - **Step B: Evaluate Stock Dynamics**
     - Check if the stock after consumption decreased significantly compared to earlier rounds.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If (proportion of defects > 50%) and (stock decrease is significant):
       - **Action:** Defect
       - **Rationale:** High defects indicate others are exploiting the resource; defecting maximizes immediate gain.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
       - **Rationale:** Maintain resource sustainability if cooperation levels are sufficient.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Step A: Evaluate Payoff Potential**
     - Calculate potential payoff from both actions given the current stock.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If defecting yields a higher immediate payoff without causing significant future impact:
       - **Action:** Defect
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
       - **Rationale:** Ensure a stable payoff if cooperation is viable.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Continue cooperating to sustain growth.
- **Low Stock Levels (<20% capacity):** Switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains, as recovery is unlikely.
- **Persistent Defects:** Temporarily defect until cooperation restores resource levels or defects reduce.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```pseudocode
Initialize: cooperate = True

for each round in 1 to r:
    if round == 1:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        prev_defects = number of Defectors in previous round
        stock_decrease = (previous_stock - current_stock) / capacity > threshold
        
        if prev_defects / n > 0.5 and stock_decrease:
            action = Defect
            cooperate = False
        else:
            if not cooperate:
                # Check if cooperation has improved in last few rounds
                recent_coop_trend = (sum of Cooperate actions in last k rounds) >= threshold
                if recent_coop_trend:
                    action = Cooperate
                    cooperate = True
                else:
                    action = Defect
            else:
                action = Cooperate
    
    # Execute action and observe stock update

# Final Round Adjustment
if round == r:
    payoff_C = current_stock / (2*n)
    payoff_D = current_stock / n
    if payoff_D > payoff_C * 0.9:  # If Defecting yields at least 90% of Cooperate's payoff
        action = Defect
    else:
        action = Cooperate
```

### Summary:
This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on current conditions, ensuring resource sustainability while maximizing immediate gains when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_445 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

The problem involves determining an optimal strategy in a resource management game where players (including yourself) can either Cooperate or Defect. The goal is to maximize your total payoff over multiple rounds while considering the actions of other players.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Resource Dynamics**: Each player's action affects the stock level, which determines payoffs. Cooperating preserves resources and allows growth, while Defecting maximizes immediate gain but risks long-term depletion.
2. **Other Players' Strategies**: Without knowing others' strategies, assumptions must be made about their behavior (e.g., whether they will Cooperate or Defect).
3. **Payoff Calculation**: Payoff depends on the amount taken and the remaining stock's growth.

### Strategy Development:
The strategy balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability. The proposed approach is conditional cooperation based on the stock level relative to a threshold.

#### Steps:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to encourage resource preservation and growth.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision-Making**:
   - Set a high threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity) above which continuing to Cooperate is sustainable.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources before potential collapse.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initial Round**: Choose to Cooperate to help maintain or increase the resource level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **If Stock Level (S) ≥ 90% of Capacity (C)**: Continue Cooperating, as this indicates sufficient preservation and growth potential.
   - **If S < 90% of C**: Switch to Defecting, as the lower stock suggests insufficient cooperation, leading to a likely collapse; defecting maximizes short-term gain.

### Rationale:
- **Sustainability at High Levels**: When the stock is high (above 90%), Cooperating ensures resources are preserved and can grow, benefiting all players in the long run.
- **Response to Low Stock**: If the stock drops significantly, it signals that not enough players are Cooperating. Defecting becomes advantageous as it allows you to take a larger share before the resource is depleted.

### Testing the Strategy:
Simulations show that while this strategy can sustain cooperation when most players Cooperate, the presence of even a few Defectors can cause the stock to drop below the threshold, leading all players to Defect and collapse the system. However, it's a robust approach under conditions where cooperation is prevalent or recoverable.

### Conclusion:
The optimal strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by Cooperating when resources are abundant and defecting when they become scarce. This approach aims to maximize individual payoff while attempting to sustain the resource for mutual benefit.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the current stock is at least 90% of capacity; otherwise, Defect}}

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate (C)**: If the current stock level \( S \) is below a dynamically adjusted threshold \( T \).
   - **Defect (D)**: If \( S \geq T \).

2. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**:
   - Calculate \( T \) as an average of the past \( k \) rounds' stock levels, where \( k \) can be a fixed number or adjusted based on game progression.
   - Adjust \( T \) upwards if the stock has been growing steadily over recent rounds; lower \( T \) if the stock is declining.

3. **Initial and Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to build a stable stock base.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds)**: Apply stricter cooperation thresholds to preserve the resource, ensuring that any remaining rounds can still benefit from a healthy stock.

      - \( T \): Threshold initialized based on initial stock.
      - HistoricalStocks: List to track past stock levels.

   b. **Each Round**:
      1. Observe current stock \( S \).
      2. Calculate the threshold \( T \) as the average of the past \( k \) stock levels.
      3. If \( S < T \):
         - Play C.
      4. Else:
         - Play D.
      5. Record \( S \) for future threshold adjustments.

   c. **Adaptation**:
      - After each round, update HistoricalStocks and adjust \( T \) based on trends (e.g., increase \( T \) if stock is rising, decrease if falling).

This strategy ensures adaptive behavior, promoting cooperation when the resource is vulnerable and allowing defection when sustainable. It's robust to various opponent behaviors by focusing on observable state variables rather than others' strategies.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
Initialize:
    threshold = initial_stock  # Start with initial stock as threshold
    historical_stocks = [initial_stock]
    k = min(10, r)  # Number of past rounds to consider for threshold

for each round in 1 to r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    # Calculate dynamic threshold T
    if len(historical_stocks) >= k:
        T = average of last k entries in historical_stocks
    else:
        T = average of all available stocks
    
    # Determine action based on T and current stock
    if current_stock < T:
        play C
    else:
        play D
    
    # Update historical data for next round's threshold calculation
    historical_stocks.append(current_stock)
    
    # Adapt threshold based on trend (simplified example)
    if len(historical_stocks) > 1 and historical_stocks[-1] > historical_stocks[-2]:
        T *= 0.95  # Lower threshold if stock is increasing
    else:
        T *= 1.05  # Increase threshold if stock is stable or decreasing
    
    # Ensure T remains within reasonable bounds (e.g., between capacity/4 and capacity)
    T = max(capacity / 4, min(T, capacity))
    
end for
```

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring the common pool resource remains healthy throughout the game.

description_COLLECTIVE_447 = '''
To address the challenge of managing a common pool resource sustainably while maximizing individual payoffs in a multi-player, simultaneous-move game, we propose the **Adaptive Cooperation with Averaging** strategy. This strategy dynamically adjusts cooperation based on current resource levels and historical behavior trends, fostering sustainable use when beneficial.

### Strategy Outline

1. **Objective**: Maintain sustainable resource use while maximizing individual payoffs through rounds by balancing cooperation and defection based on observed conditions.

2. **Decision Rules**:
   - In each round, decide to Cooperate or Defect using the following criteria:
     a. Calculate the current stock level as a percentage of capacity: \( S_{\text{pct}} = \frac{\text{Current Stock}}{\text{Capacity}} \).
     b. Compute the average cooperation rate over the past k rounds (e.g., k=3 or 5): 
        \[
        \text{avg\_C\_prev} = \frac{\sum \text{Number of Cooperators in last } k \text{ rounds}}{k \times n}
        \]
     c. Apply thresholds:
        - If \( S_{\text{pct}} > 70\% \) AND \( \text{avg\_C\_prev} > 50\% \), Cooperate.
          - Encourages sharing when the resource is healthy and others are cooperating.
        - Else if \( S_{\text{pct}} < 60\% \) OR \( \text{avg\_C\_prev} < 40\% \), Defect.
          - Signals self-preservation due to low resources or widespread defection.
        - Otherwise, default to Cooperate.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Start by Cooperating since there's no history.
   - **Insufficient History (e.g., first k rounds)**: Use available data and default to Cooperate until enough history is built.

### Rationale

- The strategy promotes cooperation when it benefits the group, ensuring sustainable resource use. When resources are low or defection is prevalent, it allows for self-preservation by defecting.
- Using an average of past cooperation rates smooths out decision-making, preventing volatility from short-term behavior swings and fostering stability.

### Conclusion

This approach balances immediate needs with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and allowing defection as needed. It dynamically adapts to current conditions, making it robust for managing common pool resources in a multi-player setting.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_448 = '''
The optimal strategy for maximizing payoffs while considering the sustainability of the resource involves balancing cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and current resource levels. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same, helping maintain a high stock level.

2. **Adaptive Behavior in Subsequent Rounds**:
   - For rounds 2 through r-1 (all except the last), assess the previous round's cooperation rate.
   - If more than half of the players cooperated and the current stock is above 60% of capacity, continue to cooperate. This maintains resource sustainability when cooperation is widespread.
   - If the cooperation rate drops below this threshold or the stock falls below a critical level (20%), switch to defecting to prevent further resource depletion.

3. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, defect regardless of past behavior since there's no future punishment for defection.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate initially and continue doing so if more than half of players cooperated previously and the stock remains above 60% capacity. Otherwise, defect, especially in the last round. This approach balances cooperation sustainability with necessary defection when cooperation falters or resources are low.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; continue cooperating only if over half cooperate and stock is above 60%; otherwise, defect. Defect in the final round.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_449 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Cooperative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The proposed strategy is designed to maximize collective payoff while adapting to opponents' behaviors and game dynamics.

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation helps maintain a high stock level, promoting growth for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Calculate Cooperation Rate:** Determine the proportion of times opponents have chosen C in previous rounds.
   - **Determine Thresholds:**
     - **Cooperation Threshold (CT):** Set at 60% initially, adjusted dynamically based on remaining rounds.
     - **Stock Threshold (ST):** Based on current stock relative to capacity and remaining rounds.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If the stock is above ST and opponents' cooperation rate exceeds CT:
       - Choose Cooperate (C)
     - Else:
       - Choose Defect (D)

3. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - As rounds progress, lower CT to encourage more defection towards the end.
   - ST decreases as rounds near conclusion, emphasizing immediate payoffs.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to preserve stock.
   - **Last Round:** Evaluate based on current stock and cooperation rate; may defect if others are likely to do so.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def strategy(history_opponents, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    opponents_coop = sum([action == 'C' for opp in history_opponents for action in opp])
    total_actions = sum([len(opp) for opp in history_opponents])
    coop_rate = opponents_coop / total_actions if total_actions > 0 else 1.0
    
    # Calculate thresholds
    remaining_rounds = total_rounds - round_number + 1
    stock_capacity_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    ct_threshold = max(0.4, 0.6 * (remaining_rounds / total_rounds))
    
    if current_stock > (capacity * 0.5) and coop_rate > ct_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to opponents' actions while considering the evolving game state.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_450 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate payoff with sustainable use of a shared resource, I propose a dynamic strategy that adjusts cooperation or defection based on the current state of the resource. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Step 1: Initialize Parameters
- **Threshold (T):** Start with an initial threshold set to 80% of capacity (e.g., T = 0.8 * capacity).
- **Adjustment Rate (α):** Choose a small rate, such as α = 0.1, to control how quickly the threshold adapts.

### Step 2: Decision Making in Each Round
For each round except the last:
1. **Observe Current Stock (S):** Check the current level of the resource.
2. **Decision Rule:**
   - If S > T: Defect (take a larger share for higher immediate payoff).
   - Else: Cooperate (preserve the resource to ensure future availability).

### Step 3: Adjust Threshold After Each Round
1. **Observe New Stock (S_new):** After your action, note the new stock level.
2. **Calculate Adjustment:**
   - Compute the change in stock: Δ = S_new - S_prev.
   - Update threshold: T += α * Δ.
   - Ensure T stays within reasonable bounds, e.g., min(T) = 0.5 * capacity and max(T) = 0.95 * capacity.

### Step 4: Handle Last Round
In the final round:
- Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.

### Example Application
Consider a scenario with n=4, capacity=100:

1. **Initial T = 80.**
2. **Round 1:** S=100 > T=80 → Defect. After consumption, stock drops to 25 (due to others' actions).
3. **Adjust T:** Δ = 25 - 100 = -75. T += α*(-75) → T decreases by 7.5 → New T=72.5.
4. **Round 2:** S=25 < T=72.5 → Cooperate. Stock recovers to 62.5.
5. **Adjust T:** Δ = 62.5 - 25 = +37.5. T += α*(+37.5) → T increases by 3.75 → New T=76.25.

This dynamic approach adapts to the resource's health, encouraging cooperation when stock is low and defection when it's abundant, while ensuring sustainable use over time.

### Final Answer
The optimal strategy dynamically balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adjusting your behavior based on the current state of the shared resource:

- **Cooperate** when the resource level is below a certain threshold.
- **Defect** when above this threshold.
- **Adaptively adjust** the threshold based on whether the resource is increasing or decreasing.

This approach maximizes cumulative payoff while preserving the resource for future rounds. The strategy can be succinctly described as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock is below a dynamically adjusted threshold; otherwise, defect.}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_451 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we developed a strategy that balances cooperation with adaptation based on others' behavior and stock levels. Here's a structured breakdown of the solution:

### Approach
The strategy involves three main components:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to encourage sustainability and build trust among players.
2. **Monitor and Adapt**: Track the proportion of Defectors over recent rounds and adjust actions accordingly. If too many players Defect, switch to Defecting; otherwise, continue Cooperating if the stock remains sufficient.
3. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Use a threshold based on the current stock level to decide between Cooperate or Defect, adjusting slightly towards the end of the game.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, remaining_rounds, current_stock, capacity, last_three_defectors):
    n = 4  # Assuming there are four players including yourself
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    
    # Calculate average proportion of defectors in the last three rounds
    avg_proportion_defectors = (sum(last_three_defectors) / (n * 3))
    
    if avg_proportion_defectors > 0.3:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock >= threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by Cooperating in the initial rounds to establish a cooperative environment and maintain the stock level.
2. **Proportion of Defectors**: By monitoring the average proportion of Defectors over the last three rounds, the strategy adapts to changes in others' behavior. If more than 30% of players Defect, it signals instability, prompting a switch to Defecting.
3. **Stock Threshold Check**: The strategy checks if the current stock is above a threshold (70% of capacity). If so, it continues Cooperating; otherwise, it defects to prevent over-depletion and maximize immediate payoff.

This approach ensures adaptability while maintaining cooperation when beneficial, balancing between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_452 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability, we propose a strategic decision-making framework for each player in the repeated game. The strategy is designed to adapt dynamically based on observed trends in resource levels.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation encourages others to do the same, fostering a sustainable resource level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 through r-1):**
   - **Observation:** Assess whether the stock increased or decreased from the previous round.
     - If the stock increased (i.e., growth exceeded total consumption), continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock decreased, switch to Defecting (D) in the next round.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** In the last round, there are no future consequences, so defecting maximizes immediate payoff.

### Edge Cases:

- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 10% of capacity), players may switch to defecting regardless of trend, as cooperation yields negligible benefits.
  
### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decision_round(current_round, total_rounds, previous_stock_change):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round < total_rounds:
        if previous_stock_change > 0:  # Stock increased
            return 'C'
        else:  # Stock decreased or stayed the same
            return 'D'
    else:  # Last round
        return 'D'
```

### Summary:

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting actions based on observed trends. Players cooperate when resources are sustainably increasing and defect when cooperation leads to depletion, ensuring optimal outcomes across all rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_453 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed an adaptive strategy that considers both the current state of the resource and the historical behavior of other players. This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, aiming to maximize individual payoff while maintaining the resource for future rounds.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first few rounds to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Stock Level Thresholds**: Use dynamic thresholds based on current stock levels to decide actions:
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 80% of capacity.
   - Defect if the stock drops below 50% of capacity.
3. **Recent Behavior Analysis**: In intermediate stock levels (between 50% and 80%), assess recent cooperation trends among other players:
   - If most players have been cooperating, continue to cooperate.
   - If a significant number defect, switch to defecting.
4. **Final Rounds Adjustment**: Switch to defecting in the last few rounds since there's no future impact.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, other_actions_history):
    capacity = get_capacity()  # Function that returns maximum sustainable stock
    
    if round_number <= 2:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number > total_rounds - 2:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Calculate recent cooperation rate
            recent_coop = sum(1 for actions in other_actions_history[-3:] for a in actions if a == 'C')
            total_actions = len(other_actions_history[-3:]) * (number_of_players - 1)  # Exclude self
            if total_actions == 0:
                return 'C'
            if recent_coop / total_actions > 0.6:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Rounds**: The strategy starts with cooperation to foster a collaborative environment.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: By setting thresholds based on stock levels, the strategy adapts to the current state of the resource.
- **Behavior Analysis**: Examining recent actions helps predict future behavior and decide whether to cooperate or defect based on others' tendencies.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment**: Recognizing that the last few rounds have no future impact, the strategy switches to maximizing immediate payoff.

This approach ensures a balance between individual gain and long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on both current conditions and past behaviors.

The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize collective payoff while encouraging sustainable use of the common pool resource. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Strategy Overview
- **Adaptive Cooperation Threshold**: Players dynamically adjust their cooperation based on historical cooperation levels from other players, with thresholds increasing over time or in response to stock depletion.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: Specific rules for the first and last rounds ensure initial encouragement of cooperation and cautious defecting towards the end.

### Decision Rules
1. **Cooperate if Historical Cooperation Meets Threshold**:
   - Each player tracks the number of Cooperate actions (C) from others in previous rounds.
   - They cooperate in the current round if this count meets or exceeds their dynamic threshold.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**:
   - The threshold increases as the game progresses, ensuring a stronger emphasis on cooperation over time.
   - Adjustments can also be based on stock levels; rapid depletion triggers higher thresholds to encourage preservation.

### Edge Cases Handling
- **First Round**: Default to Cooperate (C) to set a positive precedent and encourage others to follow suit.
- **Last Few Rounds**: Tendency to Defect (D) increases as future impacts are lessened, but balanced with the need to maintain resource sustainability.

### Feedback Mechanism
- Incorporates feedback on stock changes; rapid depletion triggers higher thresholds to promote cooperation and prevent over-exploitation.

### Pseudocode Implementation
```python
def decide_action(player_id, history_cooperations, current_round, total_rounds, stock_level):
    # Initial threshold setup based on game parameters and progression
    base_threshold = 0.5  # Base proportion of cooperators needed to cooperate
    time_factor = (current_round / total_rounds) ** 2  # Increasing factor over rounds
    depletion_factor = max(1 - (stock_level / capacity), 0.5)  # Response to stock depletion

    threshold = base_threshold + time_factor * depletion_factor

    # Calculate proportion of historical cooperations
    if current_round == 1:
        cooperation_prop = 1.0  # First round default to cooperate
    else:
        total_actions = (current_round - 1) * (n - 1)
        cooperation_prop = sum(history_cooperations) / total_actions

    # Decision based on threshold comparison
    if cooperation_prop >= threshold or current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage within the game loop
for each round in r:
    for each player in n:
        action = decide_action(player_id, history_cooperations, round, r, stock_level)
        record_action(action)
    update_stock()
```

### Conclusion
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively responding to others' behaviors and the state of the resource. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and adjusts thresholds dynamically to maintain resource levels effectively.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Historical Behavior and Stock Levels**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to foster a positive environment and encourage resource preservation.

   - **Defection Response:** If less than or equal to 40% of players Cooperated, Defect (D) to signal against excessive defection and protect immediate payoffs.

3. **Stock Level Adjustment:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to the capacity:
     - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, Cooperate to encourage growth.
     - If the stock is below or equal to 25%, Defect to maximize immediate payoff as future sustainability may be compromised.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - After each round, adjust the cooperation threshold based on the observed impact on stock levels and payoffs:
     - Increase the cooperation threshold if stock recovery is robust.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, a strategic approach is designed to balance immediate payoffs with long-term resource sustainability. Here's an organized strategy based on the thought process:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperation-Defection

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Aims to set a positive precedent, encouraging others to preserve the resource and allowing it to replenish.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Observation:**
     - Track other players' actions (C or D) and their cumulative contributions to stock depletion.
   - **Proportion of Defectors:**
     - If a significant majority (e.g., >50%) are defecting, switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoff before potential collapse.
     - Otherwise, continue cooperating to preserve the resource.
   - **Stock Level Monitoring:**
     - Maintain an optimal target stock level (e.g., around half of capacity).
     - Cooperate if above target; consider defecting if below to capitalize on remaining resources.

3. **Endgame Handling (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Focus on maximizing immediate payoffs since there's no future benefit in preserving the resource.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Continuously adjust thresholds for cooperation/defection based on observed behavior and stock dynamics.
   - Use feedback from past rounds to refine strategies, ensuring adaptability without causing instability.

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to foster a sustainable environment.
- **Adaptive Behavior:** Monitors others' actions and stock levels to decide between cooperation or defection, balancing immediate gains against future sustainability.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Shifts focus to maximizing payoffs in the final rounds when preservation no longer benefits future interactions.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while promoting collective resource management, adapting dynamically to changing conditions without relying on explicit coordination.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_457 = '''
To address the problem of sustaining a shared resource through cooperation or defection, we propose an adaptive strategy based on monitoring the current stock level relative to its capacity. The key idea is to cooperate when the stock is sufficiently high and defect when it falls below a critical threshold, encouraging conservation.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define Threshold:** Establish a threshold, set at two-thirds (2/3) of the resource's maximum capacity. This threshold serves as a trigger point for switching strategies.

2. **Monitor Stock Level:** Continuously track the current stock level relative to the defined threshold.

3. **Decision-Making:**
   - If the current stock is above the threshold (i.e., greater than 2/3 of capacity), players should cooperate by contributing to resource maintenance.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, players switch to defecting, reducing their consumption or contributions to allow the resource to recover.

4. **Adaptation:** Optionally, adjust the threshold dynamically based on historical trends (e.g., increasing cooperation if the stock shows signs of recovery and vice versa).

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy combines cooperation when the resource is abundant with defection when it's scarce to prevent overuse. Players should:

1. Cooperate when the current stock exceeds two-thirds of its capacity.
2. Defect otherwise.

This approach balances resource use, encouraging sustainability by maintaining the resource when it's healthy and conserving it when threatened.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the current stock is above } \frac{2}{3} \text{ of capacity; otherwise defect.}}

To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable resource level while balancing individual benefits, we propose a strategy that adapts based on the current state of the resource. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperation-Defection Based on Stock Threshold

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the initial rounds to build or maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Monitor Current Stock (S)**:
   - After each round, observe the new stock level and compare it against a predetermined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).

3. **Adjust Strategy Based on Threshold**:
   - **Cooperate**: If the current stock \( S \) is above or equal to the threshold.
     - Reasoning: A healthy stock allows for sustainable growth when Cooperating, maximizing long-term benefits.
   - **Defect**: If the current stock \( S \) falls below the threshold.
     - Reasoning: Defecting reduces immediate consumption, allowing the stock to recover and preventing further depletion.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (Optional)**:
   - To optimize responsiveness, consider adjusting the threshold dynamically based on recent trends or performance.
   - Use a moving average of past stock levels to determine thresholds, giving more weight to recent data for timely adjustments.

### Example Scenarios:

- **All Cooperate**: The stock remains stable at 100%, ensuring maximum sustainable growth and payoffs.
  
- **Mixed Strategies**:
  - If some players Defect while others Cooperate, the stock may decrease initially. However, as players monitor the stock drop below the threshold, they switch to Defecting, reducing consumption and allowing the stock to recover over subsequent rounds.

- **Majority Defection**: If most players Defect persistently, the stock might continue to decline. This scenario highlights the importance of maintaining cooperation levels above a critical mass to sustain the resource effectively.

### Considerations:

- **Threshold Selection**: The threshold should be chosen carefully to balance between preventing overconsumption and avoiding unnecessary defection. It may need adjustment based on specific game dynamics or observed behavior patterns.
  
- **Adaptation Lag**: Since players base their decisions on previous rounds' stock levels, there might be a delay in response to rapid changes. Incorporating recent trends can help mitigate this lag.

### Conclusion:

This strategy encourages cooperation when the resource is healthy and switches to defection as a corrective measure when overconsumption threatens sustainability. By dynamically adapting based on the resource's state, it balances individual interests with collective well-being, fostering an equilibrium where cooperation prevails when beneficial and defection serves as a safeguard against depletion.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock is above 75% of capacity; otherwise, Defect.}}

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize long-term payoffs by balancing cooperation and defection based on game dynamics and opponent behaviors. Here's the organized approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with Cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage others to do the same, fostering a cooperative environment.

2. **Monitoring Behavior**: Observe other players' actions over time. Track the number of Cooperators and Defectors. Use recent behavior (weighted more heavily) to assess current strategies.

3. **Stock Level Thresholds**: 
   - If the stock remains above 50% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
   - If it drops below this threshold, consider switching to Defecting to punish Defectors and encourage future cooperation.

4. **Adaptive Retaliation**: 
   - Retaliate by defecting if a significant number of players are defecting.
   - After retaliation, if the stock recovers, revert to Cooperating to reset the cooperative environment.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to set a positive tone.
   - **Last Few Rounds**: Adjust based on current stock. If high, Cooperate; if low, consider Defecting cautiously to avoid excessive depletion.

6. **Sustainability vs Immediate Gain**: Balance between short-term gains from defecting and the long-term benefits of cooperation, ensuring sustainable stock levels for future rounds.

This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while being responsive to defectors, aiming to maximize total payoff over all rounds by promoting a cooperative equilibrium.

description_COLLECTIVE_460 = '''
To address the challenge of sustainably managing a shared resource through cooperative behavior, I propose a strategic approach that each player can adopt independently. This strategy is designed to maintain the health of the resource while allowing for adaptation based on observed actions of others.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating in the first round. This sets a positive precedent and aligns with the goal of sustainability.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making:** Establish a threshold, specifically half of the resource's capacity (e.g., 50 units if capacity is 100). If the current stock level exceeds this threshold, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

3. **Sustainability Mechanism:** When the stock remains above the threshold, Cooperating ensures that consumption does not exceed regenerative capacity. This maintains a stable resource level over time, as seen in scenarios where all players Cooperate, leading to consistent replenishment.

4. **Adaptation to Defection:** If the stock drops below the threshold due to increased Defection by others, switch to Defecting. This action serves two purposes: it prevents further depletion by reducing individual contribution to consumption and incentivizes others to reconsider their strategies to avoid a resource collapse.

5. **Recovery Process:** Even if some players Defect temporarily, as long as the majority Cooperates above the threshold, the resource can recover. The regenerative growth ensures that the stock level oscillates upwards over time, reinforcing the effectiveness of the strategy.

**Answer:**

Each player should adopt a simple yet effective strategy:

1. **Start by Cooperating:** In the first round, choose to Cooperate to promote sustainable use and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Set a Threshold at Half Capacity:** If the current stock level is greater than half of the total capacity (e.g., 50 units if capacity is 100), continue to Cooperate. This threshold ensures that resource consumption remains within regenerative limits, maintaining stability.

3. **Adapt Based on Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below this threshold due to increased Defection by others, switch to Defecting. This action prevents further depletion and signals to others the need for cooperative behavior to sustain the resource.

4. **Encourage Recovery:** By Cooperating when above the threshold and defecting only when necessary, the system can recover from temporary declines. The regenerative nature of the resource ensures that as long as most players adhere to this strategy, sustainability is maintained over time.

**Final Answer:**

Each player should begin by Cooperating. If the current stock level exceeds half of capacity (e.g., 50 units for a total of 100), continue to Cooperate; otherwise, Defect. This strategy ensures sustainable resource management and adapts to changes in others' behaviors.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the stock is above half capacity; otherwise, defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_461 = '''
**Final Strategy Description: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

The strategy is designed to promote sustainable resource use while adapting to the behavior of other players. It balances cooperation for long-term benefits against defecting to maximize immediate gains, especially as the game progresses.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 60% of capacity.
   - Defect if the stock is below this threshold to salvage what can be taken.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Calculate the average stock level over the past 10 rounds (or a fixed number, whichever is smaller).
   - Cooperate if the average stock is above 60% of capacity.
   - Defect otherwise to maximize immediate gain.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 20%):**
   - Always defect to maximize personal payoff without concern for future depletion.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **First Round:** Cooperate if stock > 60% of capacity; else, defect.
- **Last Round:** Always defect.
- **Stock Near Capacity (>80%):** Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
- **Stock Near Depletion (<30%):** Defect to maximize gains before resource exhaustion.

---

### **Implementation Notes**

- Use thresholds (e.g., 60%, 30%) based on empirical testing or theoretical analysis.
- Consider recent stock trends over the past few rounds to adapt to changing player behaviors.
- Vary last-round behavior slightly or introduce randomness to prevent exploitation by others.

This strategy aims for collective sustainability when possible while adapting to exploit opportunities for higher payoffs as needed.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_462 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining sustainable resource levels through cooperative actions while adapting to potential defections, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both current resource levels and historical cooperation rates. The strategy incorporates thresholds for resource sustainability and hysteresis to prevent oscillations between cooperation and defection.

### Approach
The proposed approach involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to promote sustainable resource use.
2. **Threshold-Based Decisions**:
   - If the current stock is above a high threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), continue to cooperate as it indicates a healthy resource level.
   - If the current stock drops below a low threshold (e.g., 40%), defect to maximize personal payoff before the resource collapses.
3. **Historical Cooperation Check**: When the stock is between the high and low thresholds, check the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round:
   - Cooperate if the majority (e.g., ≥70%) cooperated previously.
   - Defect otherwise to avoid being exploited by defectors.
4. **Hysteresis Effect**: To prevent oscillations, require a higher cooperation rate and sustained stock levels above the high threshold before reverting from defection back to cooperation.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(prev_stock, prev_actions):
    """
    Determines whether to Cooperate ('C') or Defect ('D') based on current state and previous actions.
    
    Args:
        prev_stock (float): The stock level before the current round.
        prev_actions (list of str): Actions taken by all players in the previous round.
        
    Returns:
        str: 'C' for Cooperate, 'D' for Defect.
    """
    n = len(prev_actions)
    capacity = 100.0  # Assuming maximum stock is 100
    
    # Define thresholds
    high_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.4 * capacity
    coop_threshold = 0.7  # 70% cooperation needed to Cooperate when in the middle zone
    
    # Calculate previous cooperation proportion
    prev_coop_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'C')
    prev_coop_proportion = prev_coop_count / n if n != 0 else 1.0
    
    # Current stock is given as prev_stock, but depending on the game's state access,
    # it could be different; assuming that the function has access to current stock
    current_stock = prev_stock  # For this example, using previous stock as current
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < low_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if prev_coop_proportion >= coop_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage
prev_actions = ['C', 'C', 'D', 'D']  # Previous round actions: two Cooperate, two Defect
prev_stock = 62.5  # Current stock before the current round

action = decide_action(prev_stock, prev_actions)
print(f"Decision: {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts with cooperation to build a sustainable resource base.
- **Threshold-Based Decisions**: By using thresholds (high at 60% and low at 40%), the strategy ensures that cooperation continues when resources are abundant and switches to defection when resources are critically low.
- **Historical Cooperation Check**: When the stock is in a middle range, the strategy evaluates past behavior. If most players cooperated previously, it continues to cooperate; otherwise, it defects to avoid exploitation.
- **Hysteresis Effect**: This prevents frequent switching by requiring a higher bar for reverting back to cooperation once defection has started.

This approach balances individual payoff maximization with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and historical interactions.

description_COLLECTIVE_463 = '''
**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoff while maintaining sustainable use of the common pool resource over multiple rounds.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to encourage others to do the same, preserving the resource and promoting sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Cooperate if:**
     - The current stock is above 80% of capacity.
     - The stock has increased compared to the previous round, indicating effective cooperation.
   - **Defect if:**
     - The current stock is below 80% of capacity.
     - The stock has decreased despite others' potential cooperation, suggesting exploitation.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

**Adaptive Thresholds and Trends:**

- **Dynamic Stock Evaluation:** Adjust the decision threshold based on the current stock level relative to capacity and the trend of stock changes over recent rounds.
- **Trend Analysis:** If the stock is increasing, continue cooperating. If decreasing, consider defecting to prevent further depletion.

**Considerations for Opponent Behavior:**

- Assume others may defect or cooperate unpredictably. The strategy should adapt by mirroring collective behavior when possible and defecting if many are exploiting the resource.
- Recognize that cooperation benefits all in the long run, while defection risks depleting the resource and reducing future payoffs.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Track historical stock levels to assess trends (increasing or decreasing).
- Adjust the cooperation threshold dynamically based on observed behavior and stock recovery potential.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by cooperatively managing the resource when possible and defecting when necessary to prevent exploitation or collapse.

description_COLLECTIVE_464 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to balance immediate gains against long-term sustainability by adapting to others' actions and the current stock level.

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to foster a sustainable resource base without prior information on others' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - Observe the previous round's cooperation rate.
   - If more than half of the players cooperated and the current stock is above a moderate threshold, continue Cooperating.
   - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate payoff or prevent resource depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Defect to capture maximum immediate payoff since future rounds do not exist.

4. **Stock Thresholds:**
   - Use the capacity as a reference point. A moderate threshold could be 60% of capacity, encouraging cooperation when the stock is healthy.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history, n, capacity):
    # Determine the action based on current state and history
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        prev_round = history[-1]
        num_coop = sum(1 for action in prev_round['actions'] if action == 'C')
        
        # Thresholds: majority cooperation and stock above moderate level
        coop_threshold = n / 2
        stock_threshold = capacity * 0.6  # Adjust as needed
        
        if num_coop >= coop_threshold and stock_level > stock_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Check if it's the last round to defect regardless of other factors
            if round_number == r:
                return 'D'
            else:
                # Consider stock level; defect if low or others are defecting
                return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
- **Initial Round:** Start with cooperation to build a sustainable resource.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** Adapt based on others' actions. If a majority cooperate and the stock is healthy, continue Cooperating. Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate gains or prevent further depletion.
- **Last Round:** Switch to Defecting to capture maximum payoff without concern for future rounds.

This strategy encourages mutual cooperation when beneficial and adapts to exploit situations where others defect, balancing between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

The optimal strategy for each player in this scenario is to consistently cooperate. By doing so, all players maintain the resource at its maximum capacity, ensuring sustainable high payoffs for everyone over time.

$\boxed{\text{Always Cooperate}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_466 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Conservation with Responsive Defection**

**Objective:** Maximize cumulative payoff over the rounds by balancing resource conservation and strategic defection.

---

### **Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Cooperate (C):** Start with cooperation in the initial rounds to encourage others to conserve the resource, aiming for sustainable payoffs.
   - **Rationale:** Early cooperation helps maintain a healthy stock level, which is crucial for long-term gains.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Health:**
     - Calculate the stock's percentage relative to capacity (Stock / Capacity).
     - Define thresholds:
       - **High Conservation Threshold (HCT):** 70% of capacity.
       - **Low Conservation Threshold (LCT):** 30% of capacity.

   - **If Stock is Above HCT:**
     - **Cooperate (C):** Continue cooperating to sustain the resource and encourage others to do the same.
   
   - **If Stock is Between LCT and HCT:**
     - **Adaptive Strategy:**
       - Cooperate in rounds where at least 70% of other players cooperated in the previous round.
       - Defect otherwise, signaling the need for caution due to resource strain.

   - **If Stock is Below LCT:**
     - **Defect (D):** Focus on maximizing immediate payoff while attempting to reset others' strategies by reducing dependency on sustainable play.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Defect (D):** Prioritize immediate payoff as future rounds no longer exist, aiming to maximize gains without worrying about long-term sustainability.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative precedent and encourage others to maintain the resource.

2. **Last Few Rounds:**
   - Shift strategy to defecting (D) to capitalize on remaining stock without concern for future rounds.

3. **Stock at Capacity:**
   - Cooperate (C) to continue sustainable harvesting and avoid potential crashes from overconsumption.

4. **Stock Near Depletion (Below LCT):**
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff while signaling the need for others to adjust their strategies.

---

### **Collective Mindset Alignment**

- **Sustainability First:** Cooperate when the stock is healthy to maintain long-term benefits.
- **Responsive Adaptation:** Adjust actions based on stock trends and other players' behaviors, encouraging mutual adaptation towards sustainability or defecting as needed.
- **Fair Play:** Signal through cooperation or defection to influence others towards collective resource management.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(state, history):
    n = state['n']
    r = state['r']
    current_round = state['current_round']
    stock = state['stock']
    capacity = state['capacity']

    # Calculate thresholds
    hct = 0.7 * capacity
    lct = 0.3 * capacity

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    if current_round > 0.75 * r:
        return 'D'
    
    stock_pct = stock / capacity

    if stock_pct >= hct:
        # Cooperate
        return 'C'
    
    elif lct <= stock_pct < hct:
        # Check previous round's cooperation rate among others
        prev_actions = [action for (player, action) in history[-1] if player != self]
        coop_rate = sum(1 for a in prev_actions if a == 'C') / len(prev_actions)
        
        if coop_rate >= 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    else:  # stock < lct
        # Defect to maximize immediate payoff
        return 'D'
```

---

**Summary:** This strategy balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection in response to resource strain or nearing the end of the game. It adapts based on observable trends and encourages others to adjust their behaviors towards maintaining or exploiting the common pool resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_467 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. This approach is adaptive and robust, designed to work without relying on coordination or communication between players.

### Strategy Overview:

The strategy begins with cooperation to maintain a high stock level, which promotes sustainable growth. It adapts based on the current stock level and the behavior of other players. If the stock is healthy and most players are cooperating, the strategy continues to cooperate. However, if the stock drops significantly or many players defect, it switches to defection to maximize immediate gains while preventing further resource depletion.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Always Cooperate to maintain a high stock level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **High Stock (Above 90% of Capacity):** Cooperate, as sustainability benefits all.
   - **Moderate Stock (Between 30%-90%):** 
     - If at least 70% of players Cooperated in the last round, continue Cooperating to sustain the resource.
     - Otherwise, Defect, as others are exploiting the resource.
   - **Low Stock (Below 30% Capacity):** Switch to Defection to maximize immediate gains.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 80%, ensuring a fair share without depletion.
   - Defect otherwise, maximizing personal gain without concern for future sustainability.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Round Adjustment:** Prioritize immediate gains when no future rounds are left.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, round_number, n_players, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    high_threshold = 0.9 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < low_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Consider opponent behavior in previous rounds
        recent_coop_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C')
        if recent_coop_count / n_players >= 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # For the last round, adjust based on stock level to maximize own gain
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Conclusion:

This strategy promotes cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection only when necessary, balancing individual optimization with collective sustainability. It adapts dynamically based on observable factors, making it effective against various opponent strategies without relying on coordination mechanisms.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_468 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategic approach that balances cooperation for sustainable resource use with defecting when necessary to maximize immediate gains. This strategy is adaptive and relies solely on observable game states without assuming knowledge of other players' behaviors.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to promote a sustainable start.
2. **Adaptive Strategy**: For subsequent rounds (excluding the last), evaluate the current stock level:
   - If the stock is above 80% of its capacity, continue to cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains while anticipating potential resource depletion.
3. **Final Round Defection**: Always defect in the last round since there are no future rounds to benefit from maintaining resources.

This approach ensures that cooperation is maintained when it leads to sustainable outcomes and switches to defection when necessary to prevent being exploited or when resources are dwindling.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_stock, capacity, total_rounds, current_round):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif current_round < total_rounds:
        threshold = 0.8 * capacity
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Defect"
    else:  # Last round
        return "Defect"
```

### Explanation
- **First Round**: The strategy starts with cooperation to encourage a sustainable use of resources.
- **Subsequent Rounds (Except Last)**: By monitoring the stock level against an 80% capacity threshold, the strategy adapts. If the stock is high enough, it continues to cooperate, ensuring sustainable consumption and growth. If the stock falls below this threshold, it defects to maximize immediate gains, recognizing that resources may be depleting rapidly.
- **Last Round**: Defecting in the final round ensures maximizing one's payoff without concern for future rounds.

This approach effectively balances between cooperation for long-term benefits and defecting when necessary, ensuring adaptability based on observable game states.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_469 = '''

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_470 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we'll outline a clear strategy for managing actions in a common pool resource game based on the given considerations. This strategy aims to balance cooperation for sustainability with defecting when necessary to maximize gains.

### Approach
The strategy is divided into three phases based on the number of remaining rounds and the current state of the stock:

1. **Early Phase (First 1/3 of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate always.
   - **Rationale:** Early cooperation helps maintain a high stock level, encouraging growth and sustainable play.

2. **Middle Phase:**
   - **Action:** Monitor the average stock over recent rounds.
     - **If Average Stock > 75% of Capacity:** Continue cooperating to sustain the resource.
     - **If Average Stock ≤ 75% of Capacity:** Start defecting more frequently to maximize personal gain before potential depletion.

3. **Late Phase (Last 1/3 of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect always.
   - **Rationale:** Near the end, defecting maximizes immediate gains as there's no future benefit from cooperation.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, total_rounds, remaining_rounds):
    early_phase = total_rounds // 3
    late_phase = 2 * (total_rounds // 3)
    
    # Early phase: always cooperate
    if remaining_rounds > early_phase:
        return "cooperate"
    
    # Late phase: always defect
    if remaining_rounds <= late_phase:
        return "defect"
    
    # Middle phase: decide based on current stock and trend
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return "cooperate"
    else:
        return "defect"
```

### Explanation
- **Early Phase:** The first third of the game focuses on cooperation to build or maintain a high stock level, which supports future growth and sustainability.
  
- **Middle Phase:** During this phase, actions are determined by the current stock relative to a threshold (75% of capacity). If the stock is above this threshold, continuing to cooperate helps sustain it. If below, defecting becomes advantageous to capitalize on remaining resources before potential depletion.

- **Late Phase:** In the final third of the game, defecting maximizes immediate gains since there are no future rounds left where cooperation would benefit.

This strategy balances between encouraging sustainable practices early and adapting to situations where defecting provides a better personal outcome, especially towards the end of the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_471 = '''
**Final Answer:**

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (ACT)

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over multiple rounds by balancing immediate gains against resource sustainability.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

#### **Cooperate (C) when:**
- The current stock level \( S \) is above a dynamically adjusted threshold \( T_{\text{coop}} \).
- OR, if defecting would lead the stock below \( T_{\text{critical}} \), which risks resource depletion.

#### **Defect (D) when:**
- The stock level \( S \) is below \( T_{\text{coop}} \), and defecting won't push it below \( T_{\text{critical}} \).
- OR, in the last few rounds (adjust based on remaining rounds), where immediate gain is prioritized.

### **2. Dynamic Thresholds**

#### **\( T_{\text{coop}} \):**
Calculated each round as:
\[ T_{\text{coop}} = \text{min}(0.75 \times \text{capacity}, S + \text{growth}) \]
Adjusts based on historical growth and current stock.

#### **\( T_{\text{critical}} \):**
Set to prevent depletion:
\[ T_{\text{critical}} = 0.25 \times \text{capacity} \]

### **3. Memory Mechanism**

- Track historical stock changes.
- If the stock has decreased significantly in recent rounds, increase \( T_{\text{coop}} \) to encourage more cooperation.

### **4. Fallback for Critical Stock**

If \( S < T_{\text{critical}} \):
- All players switch to Cooperate (C) to allow regrowth.

### **5. Edge Cases Handling**

#### **First Round:**
- Start with Cooperate (C) to build a sustainable base.

#### **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20% of rounds):**
- Gradually shift towards Defect (D), balancing immediate gains without severe depletion.

### **6. Implementation Steps**

1. **Initialize Parameters:**
   - \( T_{\text{coop}} = 0.75 \times \text{capacity} \)
   - \( T_{\text{critical}} = 0.25 \times \text{capacity} \)

2. **Each Round:**
   a. Observe current stock \( S \).
   b. Calculate thresholds.
   c. Determine action based on thresholds and historical data.

3. **Adjust Thresholds Dynamically:**
   - After each round, update thresholds based on observed behavior and stock changes.

4. **Fallback Check:**
   - If \( S < T_{\text{critical}} \), enforce cooperation for recovery.

### **7. Pseudocode**

```python
def ACT_strategy(S, history, capacity, rounds_remaining):
    # Initialize thresholds
    T_coop = 0.75 * capacity
    T_critical = 0.25 * capacity
    
    # Adjust based on historical stock changes
    if len(history) > 1:
        avg_growth = sum([h['growth'] for h in history]) / len(history)
        T_coop = min(0.75 * capacity, S + avg_growth)
    
    # Edge case: first round
    if rounds_remaining == initial_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Edge case: last few rounds
    if rounds_remaining <= 0.2 * total_rounds:
        if S > T_critical:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    # Decision rules
    if S >= T_coop:
        return 'C'
    elif S < T_coop and S > T_critical:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Fallback to prevent depletion
        return 'C'
```

**Conclusion:** The ACT strategy dynamically adjusts cooperation and defection based on stock levels, historical data, and remaining rounds. It prioritizes sustainability while allowing for strategic adaptation against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_472 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, a balanced strategy that considers both immediate gains and long-term sustainability is essential. The strategy should adapt to the current state of the resource and the observed behaviors of other players.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Cooperate When Stock is Low or Declining:**
   - If the stock level drops below 25% of capacity, switch to cooperation to prevent further depletion and encourage recovery.
   - Monitor recent trends; if the stock has been decreasing over several rounds, prioritize cooperation to rebuild.

2. **Defect When Stock is High and Stable:**
   - When the stock exceeds 75% of capacity, defecting becomes more attractive due to higher immediate payoffs without significant risk of collapse.
   - Stability in high stock levels allows for moderate defecting while maintaining resource health.

3. **Mixed Strategy Based on Recent Cooperation Rates:**
   - For stock levels between 25% and 75%, assess the cooperation rate from recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds).
   - If more than half of players cooperated recently, lean towards cooperation to sustain mutual benefits.
   - Conversely, if defection is prevalent, consider defecting more frequently to maximize immediate gains.

4. **Adjust for Game Progression:**
   - In the first few rounds and last 10% of total rounds, prioritize cooperation to build a sustainable resource base and avoid end-game collapses.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, recent_actions, round_number, total_rounds):
    # Determine thresholds based on capacity
    low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity

    # Check stock level relative to thresholds
    if stock < low_threshold:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate when stock is critically low
    elif stock > high_threshold:
        return 'D'  # Defect when stock is abundant and stable

    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among players
    recent_rounds = min(5, len(recent_actions))
    cooperation_rate = sum(action == 'C' for action in recent_actions[-recent_rounds:]) / recent_rounds

    # Adjust based on cooperation rate
    if cooperation_rate > 0.5:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate if others are cooperating
    else:
        return 'D'  # Defect if defection is common

    # Edge cases for first and last rounds
    if round_number == 1 or round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        return 'C'  # Cooperate early and late to maintain resource
```

### Explanation:

- **Low Stock Levels:** When the stock is critically low, cooperation is essential to prevent collapse. This ensures the resource can recover for future rounds.
  
- **High Stock Levels:** Abundance allows for defecting without immediate risks, maximizing personal gains while the resource remains stable.

- **Recent Cooperation Rates:** By observing recent actions, the strategy adapts dynamically. High cooperation among players signals trustworthiness, encouraging continued cooperation. Conversely, prevalent defection may warrant a more self-serving approach.

- **Game Progression:** Early rounds set the foundation for sustainability, while late rounds require caution to avoid end-game depletion. This balance ensures long-term benefits without sacrificing immediate opportunities.

This strategy effectively navigates the complexities of the game by balancing individual gains with collective resource management, fostering adaptability and resilience against diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_473 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a multi-round scenario where players can either Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), we propose a dynamic strategy that adapts based on the current state of the resource, past player behavior, and the progression of rounds. The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff while preventing unnecessary depletion of the shared resource.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation promotes sustainability and sets a positive precedent for other players.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Level and Trend:**
     - If the stock is above 80% of capacity and increasing, continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock is between 60%-80%, check recent cooperation rates:
       - If more than 70% of players have been Cooperating in the last few rounds, Cooperate.
       - Otherwise, consider Defecting to maximize immediate payoff while others are not sustaining the resource.
   - **If Stock is Below 60%:**
     - Switch to Defecting until the stock recovers or if cooperation rates increase.

3. **Late Rounds (Last ~20% of total rounds):**
   - **Tend towards Defecting:** As future consequences diminish, prioritize immediate gains.
   - **Consider Current Stock Level:**
     - If above 70%, Cooperate to maintain what's left.
     - If below 70%, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Use a sliding threshold that decreases from 80% in early rounds to 60% in late rounds, reflecting the reduced need for caution as fewer future rounds remain.

5. **Final Round:**
   - Evaluate whether defecting provides significant payoff without causing excessive depletion.
   - Tend towards D but consider current stock level; if very low, Cooperate cautiously.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, previous_s, cooperation_rates):
    capacity = 100  # Assuming maximum capacity is 100 units for simplicity
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    threshold = 0.8 * (1 - current_round / total_rounds) + 0.6 * (current_round / total_rounds)
    
    if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity and current_stock >= previous_s:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < 0.6 * capacity and current_stock < previous_s:
        if cooperation_rates[-1] < 0.5:  # If less than half cooperated last round
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Cooperate cautiously, maybe with a probability based on how far below threshold
            return 'C' if random.random() > (current_stock / capacity) else 'D'
    else:
        # Between 60% and 80%
        recent_coop = sum(cooperation_rates[-5:]) / 5 if len(cooperation_rates) >=5 else cooperation_rates[-1]
        if recent_coop > 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage
current_round = 10
total_rounds = 50
current_stock = 70  # 70% of capacity
previous_s = 68    # Previous stock level was 68%
cooperation_rates = [0.8, 0.75, 0.7, 0.65, 0.6]  # Cooperation rates from last 5 rounds

action = decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, previous_s, cooperation_rates)
print(f"Action: {action}")
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Rounds:** The strategy begins with Cooperate to foster a sustainable environment.
- **Middle Rounds:** It adapts based on the stock level and recent player behavior. If others are Cooperating, it continues to Cooperate; if not, it switches to Defecting to maximize immediate gains.
- **Late Rounds:** As future rounds become fewer, the strategy leans towards Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources without worrying about long-term sustainability.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold for cooperation decreases over time, allowing players to be more lenient towards defecting as the game progresses.
- **Final Round Consideration:** Balances between Cooperating and Defecting based on the current stock level to maximize payoff without unnecessary depletion.

This strategy effectively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on the current state of the resource, past behavior of other players, and the progression of rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_474 = '''
The strategy is designed to promote cooperation while adaptively responding to defection trends, ensuring sustainability and maximizing payoffs. Here's the structured approach:

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

### Overview:
- Aims to sustain the common pool resource by promoting cooperation when feasible and defecting only when necessary.
- Uses a dynamic threshold based on current stock and historical data to decide actions.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to encourage sustainability and set a positive precedent.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation:**
   - **Base Threshold:** Starts at 80% of capacity in the first round.
   - **Decay Rate:** The threshold decreases by 5% each subsequent round, reaching lower values towards the end to account for diminishing future impact.
   - **Defector Tolerance Adjustment:** If more than 30% of players Defected in previous rounds, reduce the threshold further (to a minimum of 50%) to adapt to potential continued defection.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - In each round:
     - Calculate the current stock and determine if it's above the adjusted threshold.
     - If above, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate a sustainable approach.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds):** Lower the threshold more aggressively to prioritize short-term gains while considering the diminishing future impact of cooperation.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set initial cooperation = True.
   - Define base_threshold = 0.8 * capacity.
   - Set decay_rate = 0.95 (threshold decreases by 5% each round).

2. **Per Round Execution:**
   - For each round t from 1 to r:
     a. If t == 1: Cooperate.
     b. Else:
        i. Compute current stock S and proportion of Defectors in the previous round.
        ii. Adjust threshold by applying decay_rate^(remaining_rounds).
        iii. If proportion_defectors_prev > 0.3, lower the threshold to max(0.8 * base_threshold, 0.5).
        iv. If S >= (capacity * adjusted_threshold): Cooperate.
        v. Else: Defect.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def adaptive_threshold_strategy(t, r, n, capacity, stock_history, actions_history):
    if t == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate remaining rounds
    remaining = r - t + 1
    
    # Base threshold decay
    base_threshold = 0.8 * (capacity ** (remaining / r))
    adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * (0.95 ** (t-2))
    
    # Check proportion of Defectors in previous round
    prev_defectors = sum(1 for action in actions_history[-1] if action == 'D')
    proportion_defectors = prev_defectors / n
    
    # If too many defectors, lower threshold
    if proportion_defectors > 0.3:
        adjusted_threshold = max(adjusted_threshold * 0.8, 0.5 * capacity)
    
    # Decision based on current stock
    S = stock_history[-1]
    if S >= (capacity * adjusted_threshold):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage
round_number = 1
total_rounds = 10
players = 5
current_capacity = 100
stock_log = [90, 85, ...]  # Historical stock levels
past_actions = [['C', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'C'], ...]  # Past actions of each player

action = adaptive_threshold_strategy(round_number, total_rounds, players, current_capacity, stock_log, past_actions)
```

### Summary:
The ATC strategy balances sustainability and adaptability by dynamically adjusting cooperation thresholds. It starts with cooperation to build a sustainable base, then adjusts based on current stock levels and historical defection rates, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios without relying on coordination among players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_475 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and maintain a healthy resource level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-10%):**
   - **Current Stock Check:** Evaluate the current stock relative to capacity.
     - If stock > 75% of capacity and recent cooperation rate (last few rounds) ≥ 60%, Cooperate.
     - If stock < 25% of capacity or cooperation rate ≤ 40%, Defect.
   - **Trend Analysis:** If neither condition is met, cooperate if the stock trend is stable or increasing; otherwise, defect.

3. **Final 10% Rounds:**
   - Shift towards Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs, considering limited future rounds and potential over-depletion by others.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - **Full Stock:** Continue Cooperating for sustainable growth.
   - **Low Stock (Near 0%):** Defection yields minimal payoff; Cooperate to preserve remaining resource.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to game state and player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_476 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Reciprocity**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Cooperate unconditionally to build a stable stock level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to the capacity.
   - Track the cooperation rate of other players in recent rounds.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - If the stock is above 80% of capacity and most players cooperated in previous rounds, Cooperate.
   - If the stock drops below 60% or there's been significant defection (e.g., >50% defects in last round), Defect to signal disapproval and protect against further depletion.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - After defecting for a set number of rounds, reassess cooperation rates.
   - If others start cooperating again, revert to Cooperating if the stock is stable.

5. **Memory Mechanism:**
   - Keep track of defection history (number and frequency) to decide future actions.
   - Use a threshold based on historical data to determine when to shift strategies.

6. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - In the last few rounds, maintain cooperation if possible; if others defect, reciprocate but aim to reset cooperation in subsequent interactions if any.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```
Initialize thresholds:
    HighThreshold = 0.8 * capacity
    LowThreshold = 0.6 * capacity

Initialize state variables:
    recent_defects = []
    max_memory = 5 rounds

For each round from 1 to r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    if round <= 3:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(recent_defects)
        
        if current_stock >= HighThreshold and cooperation_rate > 0.75:
            action = Cooperate
        elif current_stock < LowThreshold or cooperation_rate < 0.5:
            action = Defect
        else:
            action = Cooperate
    
    record_current_action(action)
    add_defects_to_memory()
    
    if len(recent_defects) > max_memory:
        recent_defects.pop(0)
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively responding to both the resource state and others' behaviors, fostering a collective approach to resource management.

description_COLLECTIVE_477 = '''
**Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Dynamic Thresholds**

This strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection based on the current state of the common pool resource, historical player actions, and the number of rounds remaining. The goal is to maximize long-term payoffs while encouraging sustainable use of the resource.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round (t=1):** 
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent and helps maintain a healthy stock level for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
   - **Step 1: Assess Stock Health (S).**
     - Calculate the current stock as a percentage of capacity.
   - **Step 2: Evaluate Historical Cooperation.**
     - Determine the proportion of players who have Cooperated in previous rounds.
   - **Step 3: Apply Thresholds.**
     - If S > 70% and more than 60% of players have Cooperated historically:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Else if S < 30% or more than 40% of players have Defected in previous rounds:
       - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Step 4: Endgame Consideration.**
     - In the last 10% of rounds, prioritize Defection to maximize immediate payoffs.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round (t=1):** Always Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Shift towards Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future depletion.
- **Stock Recovery Periods:** If the stock recovers significantly due to increased cooperation, reconsider Cooperating in subsequent rounds.

---

### **Collective Strategy**

This strategy is designed to align with collective interests by promoting cooperation when feasible and defecting only when necessary. It implicitly signals through actions: Cooperating helps sustain resources, while Defecting in response to others' defection prevents exploitation.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock, capacity, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate stock health as a percentage of capacity
    stock_health = (stock / capacity) * 100
    
    # Evaluate historical cooperation rate among other players
    prev_cooperators = sum(1 for actions in history.values() 
                           if actions[-2] == 'C')  # Check previous round's actions
    coop_rate = prev_cooperators / n
    
    # Determine action based on thresholds and endgame condition
    if current_round >= total_rounds * 0.9:
        return 'D'
    
    if stock_health > 70 and coop_rate > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    elif stock_health < 30 or (1 - coop_rate) > 0.4:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Default to Cooperate if conditions are neutral
        return 'C'

# Example usage in a loop over rounds
for t in range(1, r+1):
    action = decide_action(t, r, stock, capacity, history)
    history[player].append(action)
```

---

**Summary:** This strategy dynamically adjusts between Cooperating and Defecting based on the current state of the resource, historical player behavior, and proximity to the end of the game. It aims to promote sustainability while protecting against exploitation, adapting to varying opponent behaviors in a tournament setting.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_478 = '''
To address the problem of determining whether to cooperate or defect in a game based on current stock levels and recent player behavior, we developed a strategy that balances immediate gains against future sustainability. This strategy takes into account both the current health of the resource (stock) and the cooperation rates observed in previous rounds.

### Approach
The approach involves dynamically adjusting thresholds for cooperation based on the current state of the game and historical cooperation rates among players. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Initial Cooperation Threshold**: At the beginning of the game, players will cooperate if the stock is above 80% of its capacity.
2. **Recent Cooperation Check**: After the initial rounds, the strategy looks at the cooperation rates in recent rounds (last three rounds). If more than 70% of players cooperated on average, the threshold remains at 80%. Otherwise, it lowers to encourage defecting.
3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: The cooperation threshold is dynamically adjusted based on observed cooperation rates, ensuring that players adapt their strategies to maintain a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

### Solution Code
Here's how the strategy can be implemented in Python:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, history, n_players, capacity):
    # Determine if it's an initial round (first 3 rounds)
    if round_number <= 3:
        cooperation_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    else:
        # Calculate average cooperation rate in the last 3 rounds
        recent_rounds = history[-3:]
        total_cooperations = sum(len([a for a in r['actions'] if a == 'C']) for r in recent_rounds)
        avg_coop_rate = total_cooperations / (n_players * 3)  # Average over the last 9 actions
        
        if avg_coop_rate > 0.7:
            cooperation_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
        else:
            cooperation_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    
    if current_stock >= cooperation_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Rounds**: For the first three rounds, players use a fixed threshold of 80% to decide whether to cooperate.
- **Recent Cooperation Check**: From the fourth round onwards, the strategy evaluates the average cooperation rate in the last three rounds. If more than 70% of players cooperated on average, it maintains the higher threshold (80%). Otherwise, it lowers the threshold to encourage defecting.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: This ensures that players adapt their behavior based on recent trends, balancing between exploiting resources when others are not cooperating and sustaining resources when cooperation is prevalent.

This approach effectively balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting thresholds based on observed behavior, leading to a robust strategy for maintaining cooperation while protecting against exploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_479 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperative Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set cooperation mode to `True`.
   - Initialize `defect_count` to track consecutive defections.

2. **Round-by-Round Decision Making:**

   - **First Round:**
     - Cooperate (C) to start sustainably.

   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     1. **Endgame Check:**
        - In the last 10% of rounds, defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are limited.
        
     2. **Stock Level Check:**
        - If current stock is below 30% of capacity:
          - Cooperate (C) to prevent further depletion and encourage rebuilding.

     3. **Defection Rate Check:**
        - Count the number of players who Defected in the previous round.
        - If more than 30% of players Defected:
          - Switch cooperation mode to `False` (defect this round as punishment).
          - Increment `defect_count`.
        
        - Else:
          - Maintain cooperation mode (`True`) and Cooperate (C).

     4. **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
        - If consecutive defections (`defect_count`) reach a threshold of 3 rounds:
          - Reset cooperation mode to `True` and Cooperate (C) to restart cooperation.
          - Reset `defect_count` to 0.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**

   - **Stock Depletion:**
     - If the stock reaches zero, continue playing but prioritize cooperation in subsequent rounds to rebuild if possible.

   - **High Stock Levels:**
     - When stock is near capacity (above 70%), focus on defecting as punishment only when defection rates are high to prevent over-exploitation.

4. **Implementation Notes:**

   - Use dynamic thresholds based on the number of players and capacity.
   - Ensure checks prioritize critical conditions (endgame, low stock) before considering defection rates.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, n, history):
    threshold_defection = 0.3 * n  # 30% of players
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity  # 30% of capacity
    max_consecutive_defects = 3

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        return 'D'

    if current_stock < low_threshold:
        return 'C'

    defectors_last_round = count(history[-1], 'D')
    if defectors_last_round > threshold_defection:
        action = 'D'
        defect_count += 1
    else:
        action = 'C'
    
    if defect_count >= max_consecutive_defects:
        action = 'C'
        defect_count = 0

    return action
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:** Start by Cooperating to foster a sustainable environment.
- **Endgame Strategy:** In the final 10% of rounds, prioritize defecting to maximize personal gains without concern for future repercussions.
- **Stock Management:** When stock is critically low, switch to Cooperate to prevent collapse and encourage rebuilding.
- **Social Dynamics:** Punish defection by mirroring it but forgive after a set period to restart cooperation, balancing deterrence with collaboration.

This strategy adaptively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_480 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It adapts based on others' actions and aims to maintain a healthy stock level through cooperation, defecting only when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round due to high initial stock levels, promoting resource sustainability.
2. **Monitor Consumption**: After each round, calculate the total consumption and compare it to expected consumption if all players Cooperated.
3. **Adaptive Thresholding**:
   - If actual consumption exceeds expectations significantly, indicating Defectors, lower the cooperation threshold for future rounds.
   - Maintain or raise the threshold when others Cooperate, encouraging collective resource preservation.
4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Continuously adjust the cooperation threshold based on recent stock levels and consumption patterns to decide when to Cooperate or Defect.

### Pseudocode:

```python

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts by Cooperating to maintain high resource levels.
- **Monitoring and Adjustment**: After each round, evaluates others' actions. If excessive Defection is detected, lowers the threshold for future Cooperations.
- **Threshold Dynamics**: Adjusts based on observed behavior, encouraging cooperation when possible and defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion.

This strategy fosters long-term sustainability by adapting to the collective behavior of players while maximizing individual payoffs through balanced decision-making.

description_COLLECTIVE_481 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we develop a strategic approach that balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability. The strategy involves monitoring both the current stock level and the cooperation rates among players to dynamically adjust actions each round.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating in the first round to establish a sustainable resource base.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels:** After each round, evaluate the new stock level relative to previous rounds. A significant drop may indicate increased Defectors.
3. **Adjust Based on Thresholds:**
   - **High Stock (Above 80% of Capacity):** Continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability.
   - **Moderate Stock (Between 50-80%):** Check recent cooperation rates (e.g., last 5 rounds). If more than 75% of players are Cooperating, continue Cooperating; otherwise, switch to Defecting.
   - **Low Stock (Below 30%):** Start Defecting to exploit remaining resources before potential collapse.
4. **Recovery Phase:** If the stock drops significantly below critical levels, consider defecting for a few rounds to maximize immediate payoffs while preparing for potential resource depletion.

This approach ensures that players cooperate when possible, only defecting when necessary to protect against exploitation and maintain sustainable gains over the game's duration.

**Answer:**

To optimize your strategy in this scenario, start by Cooperating. Continue Cooperating if the stock remains high (above 80% of capacity) or if most other players are Cooperating recently. Switch to Defecting if the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 30%) or if too many others are defecting, indicating resource exploitation.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; switch to Defecting if stock is low or others defect excessively}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_482 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we'll outline a strategy that balances immediate gains with sustainable resource management. The strategy adapts based on the current state of the stock and the behavior observed from other players.

### Approach
The strategy is divided into three zones based on the stock level relative to the capacity:

1. **High Zone (H)**: When the stock exceeds 75% of its capacity, cooperation is sustainable as growth can offset moderate consumption.
2. **Medium Zone (M)**: Between 25% and 75% of capacity, adapt decisions based on recent player behavior. If a significant proportion defect, respond by defecting to avoid exploitation; otherwise, continue cooperating.
3. **Low Zone (L)**: Below 25% capacity, defect to maximize immediate payoff as the stock is already at risk.

Additionally, in the final few rounds, switch to always defecting to maximize individual payoffs without worrying about future impacts.

### Solution Code
```python
def decision(current_stock, capacity, remaining_rounds, history):
    # Threshold definitions
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity

    # Check if in the last few rounds (e.g., <=3)
    if remaining_rounds <= 3:
        return 'D'

    # Determine current zone
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock <= low_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Medium zone: check recent defect rate among others
        recent_defect_rate = calculate_defect_rate(history)
        if recent_defect_rate > 0.3:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def calculate_defect_rate(history):
    total_actions = sum(len(round_history) for round_history in history.values())
    defect_count = sum(action == 'D' for round_history in history.values() for action in round_history)
    if total_actions == 0:
        return 0.0
    return defect_count / total_actions

# Example usage:
history = {1: ['C', 'D', 'C'], 2: ['D', 'D', 'C']}
print(decision(80, 100, 5, history))  # Output based on current state and history
```

### Explanation
- **High Zone (H)**: When the stock is above 75% of capacity, cooperation ensures sustainable growth without risking depletion.
- **Medium Zone (M)**: Flexibility is key here. By monitoring recent defect rates, the strategy adapts to exploit or avoid exploitation based on others' actions.
- **Low Zone (L)**: At low stock levels, maximizing immediate payoff through defection prevents further decline and potential collapse.

This approach ensures that the strategy is both adaptive and sustainable, aiming for long-term resource management while safeguarding against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_483 = '''
Players should cooperate when the current stock is at least 80% of its maximum capacity. If the stock falls below this threshold, players should defect to maximize their immediate gains.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the current stock is at least 80\% of the maximum; otherwise, defect.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_484 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on observable information. The goal is to maximize long-term benefits while adapting to various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Overview

The strategy begins with cooperation in the first round to maintain resource sustainability. It then adapts based on previous rounds' actions and current stock levels. The approach involves:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to preserve the resource when it is at maximum capacity.
2. **Cooperation Threshold**: Continue cooperating if a sufficient number of players (e.g., 60%) are also cooperating, ensuring collective sustainability.
3. **Defection Adjustment**: If cooperation drops below a threshold or the stock falls significantly, switch to defecting to prevent over-depletion.
4. **Dynamic Target Stock**: Maintain a dynamic target stock level; if the current stock is above this target, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
5. **Handling Final Rounds**: In the last round, consider defecting for maximum payoff but balance with potential resource crash.

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to preserve the resource at its peak capacity.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If more than 60% of players cooperated in the previous round and the stock is above a dynamic target, cooperate.
   - If cooperation drops below 40% or the stock falls significantly below the target, defect to prevent over-depletion.
3. **Dynamic Target Adjustment**: The target stock level adjusts based on historical consumption rates and recovery dynamics.

### Edge Cases

- **First Round**: Default to cooperation to maximize resource preservation.
- **Last Round**: Consider defecting if it maximizes immediate payoff without causing a crash; otherwise, cooperate if previous rounds indicate sustainable levels.
- **Stock Collapse**: If the stock drops too low, switch to defection for a few rounds before attempting cooperation again.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, n, capacity, stock_history, actions_history):
    # Initial round: Cooperate by default
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate previous round's cooperation rate
    prev_round = actions_history[-1]
    coops = sum(1 for action in prev_round if action == 'C')
    coop_rate = coops / n
    
    # Determine current stock level and dynamic target
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    average_growth = calculate_average_growth(stock_history)
    target_stock = max(current_stock * 0.8, capacity * 0.5)  # Adjust based on growth rate
    
    # Decision rules
    if coop_rate > 0.6 and current_stock >= target_stock:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Summary

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by adapting to observed behaviors and resource levels. It promotes cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection when necessary, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies. The approach is designed to be implemented algorithmically, providing a dynamic and adaptive solution for the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_485 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing resource exploitation and conservation, a strategic approach is proposed that integrates cooperation with adaptive adjustments based on the current stock level and others' actions. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating to support sustainability and observe others' behavior.
2. **Dynamic Threshold for Consumption**: Use a dynamic threshold (T) to decide between Cooperate (C) and Defect (D). If the stock is above T, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.
3. **Adjusting the Threshold (T)**: Start with T set to capacity/2. After each round, adjust T based on growth trends—increasing if recovery is strong, decreasing if growth is poor.
4. **Incorporate Others' Behavior**: Track recent cooperation levels. If many Cooperate, continue Cooperating; if Defectors dominate, consider defecting more to prevent exploitation.
5. **Handle Final Rounds**: Adjust T slightly lower in the last few rounds to encourage cautious consumption and prevent sudden depletion.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C).
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate current stock level (S).
   - If S > T, Cooperate; else, Defect.
3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**:
   - Initially, T = capacity/2.
   - After each round, adjust T based on observed growth and consumption trends.
4. **Incorporate Others' Behavior**:
   - Track the proportion of Cooperators in recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - If high cooperation, continue Cooperating; if many Defectors, consider defecting more frequently.
5. **Final Rounds Handling**:
   - In the final few rounds (last 10% of total), lower T to encourage more cautious consumption.
6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If stock hits zero, focus on maximizing immediate payoff by Defecting.
   - At capacity, Cooperate to maintain high levels for future growth.

### Considerations and Mitigations:
- **Oscillations**: Introduce inertia or smoothing in T adjustments to prevent abrupt changes and stabilize cooperation levels.
- **Rapid Adaptation**: Use moving averages when assessing others' actions to avoid chaotic behavior.
- **Equilibrium Potential**: Shared heuristics may lead to equilibrium, maintaining a balance between exploitation and conservation.

This strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, preventing rapid resource depletion while allowing for reasonable exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_486 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we design a collective strategy that balances cooperation for long-term gains with defection as a defense mechanism against exploitation. The strategy adapts dynamically based on observed player behavior and resource levels.

### Strategy Description:

1. **Initialization:**
   - In the first round, all players cooperate to set a baseline of resource sustainability.

2. **Dynamic Cooperation Threshold:**
   - For each subsequent round, calculate the proportion of other players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - If more than 70% of other players cooperated, continue cooperating this round to maintain high payoffs and resource levels.
   - If cooperation among others drops below 70%, defect this round to maximize immediate payoff while protecting against further resource depletion.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - Track the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), switch to defecting to exploit remaining resources before potential collapse.

4. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - In the last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.

5. **Adaptive Thresholds:**
   - Adjust cooperation thresholds based on the number of players (n) and capacity to optimize resource management and exploit patterns dynamically.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decision_rule(round_number, current_stock, history_cooperations):
    n = number_of_players()
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        cooperation_rate = sum(history_cooperations) / (round_number - 1)
        critical_stock = capacity * 0.3
        
        if cooperation_rate > 0.7 and current_stock >= critical_stock:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# In the last round, always defect
if current_round == total_rounds:
    return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization:** Starting with cooperation ensures maximum initial resource preservation.
- **Cooperation Threshold:** Encourages continued cooperation when others are cooperating, promoting sustainability.
- **Defection Defense:** Defects when others exploit, preventing excessive resource depletion.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Protects against catastrophic resource collapse by switching to defection when stock is critically low.
- **Final Round Adjustment:** Maximizes immediate payoff in the final round without concern for future rounds.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and resource levels, ensuring robust performance across various opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_487 = '''
To address the problem of preventing resource depletion through cooperation, we propose a strategy that combines responsiveness to stock trends with a conservative approach to minimize the risk of collapse. This strategy balances adaptability with caution, aiming to sustain cooperation while accounting for potential defections.

### Strategy: Responsive Conservation

1. **Cooperate if Stock is Stable or Increasing**: If the current stock level is higher than or equal to the previous round's level, all players should Cooperate. This reinforces sustainable practices when the resource shows signs of stability or growth.

2. **Adapt if Stock Decreases**: 
   - **First Decrease**: If the stock decreases slightly (e.g., by less than 10% compared to the previous round), players continue to Cooperate but monitor the trend closely.
   - **Significant Drop**: If the stock drops significantly (by more than 20%), players switch to a mixed strategy where they randomly choose between Cooperating and Defecting. This introduces uncertainty, encouraging other players to reconsider their actions.

3. **Defend Against Persistent Depletion**: If the stock decreases consecutively for two rounds (e.g., each round sees a drop of more than 10%), players should collectively Defect in the following round. This serves as a punitive measure against persistent defection, signaling that such behavior is unsustainable and will be met with reciprocal actions.

4. **Rebuild Phase**: After a period of Defection leading to stock depletion (e.g., stock drops below 50%), players enter a Rebuild Phase where they exclusively Cooperate for the next three rounds. This phase aims to restore the resource level, fostering trust and cooperation among players.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Monitor Stock Levels**: Each player tracks the stock levels from round to round.
2. **Assess Trends**: Determine if the stock is increasing, stable, or decreasing by comparing current and previous levels.
3. **Apply Strategy Rules**:
   - Cooperate on stability or slight decreases.
   - Introduce randomness on significant drops.
   - Defect collectively after persistent depletion.
4. **Initiate Rebuild Phase**: If the resource depletes significantly (e.g., below 50%), all players Cooperate for the next three rounds to rebuild the stock.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Round 1**: Stock = 100. Players Cooperate; stock remains at 100.
- **Round 2**: One player defects, causing total consumption of 62.5. Stock drops to 37.5 but grows back to approximately 84.375. The slight decrease triggers monitoring.
- **Round 3**: Stock = 84.375 (slight drop from Round 1). Players Cooperate again, consuming 50 units. Stock decreases further to ~79.46875.
- **Round 4**: Significant drop detected (~29% decrease over two rounds). Players randomly choose between C and D. Suppose some defect, leading to moderate consumption.
- **Round 5**: If the stock continues to drop significantly, players collectively Defect in Round 6.
- **Round 6**: Stock plummets to near-zero due to collective Defection. Players enter Rebuild Phase.
- **Rounds 7-9**: All Cooperate, allowing the stock to gradually recover.

This strategy encourages Cooperation while incorporating safeguards against exploitation and collapse. By adapting to trends and introducing controlled variability, it promotes long-term sustainability and resilience against defection attempts.

description_COLLECTIVE_488 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - All players start by Cooperating (C). This maintains a healthy stock level and promotes future growth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Players assess the cooperation levels of previous rounds and current stock status.
     - **Cooperation Threshold:** If more than X% of players Cooperated in the last round, continue Cooperating.
     - **Defection Trigger:** If less than X% Cooperated, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff while preventing further resource depletion.
   - Adjust threshold X based on stock changes. A significant drop lowers X, encouraging more defection.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Players evaluate if defecting yields higher immediate payoff without excessive depletion.
     - Decision based on remaining rounds and current stock level.

4. **Mid-Rounds Adjustment:**
   - Players adapt cooperation levels to prevent stock collapse, using recent history to guide decisions.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Unanimous Cooperation ensures sustainable stock growth.
- **Last Round:** Calculated decision between Cooperation and Defection based on payoff vs. depletion impact.
- **Mid-Rounds:** Flexibility in strategy prevents resource collapse while maintaining long-term sustainability.

This strategy balances immediate gains with future sustainability, encouraging collective cooperation while allowing defection when necessary to prevent over-depletion.

**Adaptive Cooperation Strategy (ACS) for Common Pool Resource Game**

The Adaptive Cooperation Strategy (ACS) is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a dynamic environment. It adapts to opponents' behaviors while maintaining flexibility to prevent resource depletion.

### Key Components:

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate:** If the current stock exceeds 75% of capacity.
   - **Defect:** If the stock is below 25%, or in the last few rounds if defecting yields a higher payoff.
   - **Conditional Cooperation:** In intermediate stock levels (25%-75%), cooperate based on opponents' past actions. Cooperate with probability proportional to the historical cooperation rate of opponents, weighted more towards recent behavior.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others and set a positive precedent.
   - **Last 10% Rounds:** Cooperate if stock is high; defect if beneficial, considering limited future rounds.

3. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   - Emphasize long-term sustainability while adapting to changing conditions without relying on coordination.

### Strategy Description:

- **Stock Thresholds:** Cooperate above 75%, defect below 25%. In between, decide based on opponents' actions.
- **Opponent Behavior Adaptation:** Use a weighted average of past cooperation rates (favoring recent actions) to determine cooperation probability.
- **Dynamic Adjustments:** Monitor stock trends and adjust thresholds dynamically if the stock consistently decreases despite cooperation.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def ACS_strategy(stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, opponents_actions):
    # Initial conditions
    if round_number == 1:
        return C
    
    # Stock-based decisions
    if stock > 0.75 * capacity:
        return C
    elif stock < 0.25 * capacity:
        return D
    
    # Calculate cooperation threshold based on opponents' past actions
    recent_weight = 0.9  # Weight for recent rounds
    total_coop = sum([action == 'C' for action in opponents_actions])
    weighted_coop = sum([recent_weight ** (len(opponents_actions) - i -1) * (action == 'C') for i, action in enumerate(opponents_actions)])
    normalized_coop = weighted_coop / len(opponents_actions)
    
    cooperation_threshold = max(0.3, min(0.7, normalized_coop))
    
    # Decision based on threshold
    if random.random() < cooperation_threshold:
        return C
    else:
        return D
    
    # Last rounds adjustment
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds * 0.1):
        future_benefit = estimate_future_benefit(stock, capacity)
        if S/n > S/(2n) + future_benefit:
            return D
        else:
            return C
```

### Considerations:

- **Feedback Loops:** Monitor for cascading defection or cooperation and adjust thresholds to mitigate negative impacts.
- **Stock Trends:** Adjust thresholds dynamically based on stock recovery trends, especially if the resource is consistently depleting despite cooperation.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to opponents' behaviors and dynamically adjusting its approach based on the current state of the common pool resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_490 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

The strategy is designed to maximize collective payoff by balancing cooperation and defection based on current stock health and recent player actions. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reasoning: Sets a positive precedent, encouraging others to cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Health Check:**
     - Calculate `stock_health = current_stock / capacity`.
     - If `stock_health > 0.8`: 
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - Reasoning: High stock health indicates sustainability, so continue cooperation.
     - If `stock_health < 0.5`:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - Reasoning: Low stock health signals potential crash; defect to maximize immediate payoff.
     - If `0.5 ≤ stock_health ≤ 0.8`:
       - **Majority Check:**
         - Examine the previous round's actions.
         - If more than half of players Cooperated last round:
           - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
             - Reasoning: Maintain trust and encourage sustainability.
         - Else:
           - **Action:** Defect (D)
             - Reasoning: retaliate against exploitation to prevent further depletion.

3. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Monitor trends in stock levels and player behavior over rounds.
   - If despite cooperation, the stock decreases significantly, adjust thresholds to be more cautious.
   - If the stock shows recovery after cooperation, reinforce cooperative actions.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C).
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20% of rounds):**
  - Shift towards Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are limited.
- **Stock Near Capacity (>80%):** Continue Cooperating as it's sustainable.
- **Stock Low (<50%):** Consider Defecting to prevent crash and maximize payoff.

This strategy adaptively adjusts based on current conditions, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion. It balances collective sustainability with individual payoff optimization.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_491 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initialization**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage sustainability and observe others' behavior.

2. **Monitoring**: Track the stock level after each round and record other players' actions (Cooperate or Defect) in recent rounds.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - Calculate the current stock as a percentage of capacity.
   - Determine the proportion of Cooperators among all players in the last few rounds.

4. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - Set a dynamic cooperation threshold for the stock level (e.g., 75% of capacity).
   - Adjust this threshold based on observed trends: if the stock consistently recovers, increase the threshold; if it depletes, decrease it.
   - Similarly, set a cooperation rate threshold (e.g., 60% of players Cooperating) to decide whether to Cooperate or Defect.

5. **Action Selection**:
   - If the current stock is above the dynamic threshold and more than the specified proportion of players Cooperated in recent rounds, Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect to prevent further resource depletion or capitalize on others' actions.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **Last Round**: Consider defecting if it maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
   - **Low Stock**: If the stock is critically low, prioritize Defecting to secure remaining resources.

7. **Testing and Adaptation**: Occasionally test cooperation even when conditions suggest defection to potentially restart cooperative behavior among players.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, previous_actions, round_number):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    stock_threshold = calculate_dynamic_threshold()
    coop_proportion = get_cooperation_proportion(previous_actions)
    
    if current_stock > stock_threshold and coop_proportion > cooperation_rate_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def calculate_dynamic_threshold():
    # Logic to adjust threshold based on historical data
    pass

def get_cooperation_proportion(actions):
    # Calculate the proportion of Cooperators in recent rounds
    pass
```

This strategy balances individual self-interest with group sustainability, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_492 = '''
The strategy involves evaluating both the current stock level and the cooperation rate among players in previous rounds. Here's how each player should decide their action:

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to help maintain the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Check if the current stock is above a defined threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) and whether more than a certain percentage of players cooperated in the last round.
   - If both conditions are met, Cooperate again.
   - Otherwise, Defect.

This approach balances sustainability with self-interest by encouraging cooperation when it's prevalent and beneficial, while allowing for defection when others are not cooperating to maximize personal gain.

**Answer:**

Each player will cooperate if the current stock is above 80% of capacity and more than 60% of players cooperated in the last round; otherwise, they will defect. This strategy balances resource preservation with individual gain.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the stock is above 80% and at least 60% of others Cooperated; else Defect}}$

description_COLLECTIVE_493 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative Strategy (ACS)

**Objective:** Maximize collective payoff by balancing current consumption with future resource sustainability through adaptive cooperation based on stock levels and historical player behavior.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reasoning: Start with cooperation to maintain a healthy stock level, allowing for sustainable growth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1:** Assess the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If `stock > 0.8 * capacity`: Cooperate (C).
       - Reasoning: High stock ensures future sustainability, so moderate consumption is preferred.
     - Else if `0.5 * capacity ≤ stock ≤ 0.8 * capacity`:
       - Check cooperation rate from the previous round.
         - If `cooperation_rate > 60%`: Cooperate (C).
           - Reasoning: Maintain cooperation to rebuild or maintain stock near optimal growth levels.
         - Else: Defect (D).
           - Reasoning: Low cooperation indicates potential overconsumption, so defect to maximize immediate payoff while others cooperate.
     - Else (`stock < 0.5 * capacity`):
       - Check cooperation rate from the previous round.
         - If `cooperation_rate > 70%`: Cooperate (C).
           - Reasoning: High cooperation suggests others are rebuilding; join efforts to recover stock.
         - Else: Defect (D).
           - Reasoning: Low cooperation implies continued overconsumption, so defect to maximize payoff.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - Adjust strategy to focus on maximizing immediate payoff with cautious cooperation:
     - If `stock > 0.8 * capacity`: Cooperate (C).
       - Reasoning: High stock allows for moderate consumption without significant impact.
     - Else: Defect (D).
       - Reasoning: Limited future rounds reduce incentive to rebuild; prioritize current payoff.

---

### **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with cooperation in Round 1.

2. **Observation and Calculation:**
   - After each round, observe others' actions to calculate the cooperation rate (`cooperation_rate = number_of_C / n`).

3. **Stock Check:**
   - Compare current stock against predefined thresholds (80%, 50%) of capacity to determine the resource's health.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Apply the above rules based on observed cooperation rates and stock levels to decide between C or D for the next round.

5. **Adjustment Near Game End:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds, prioritize immediate payoff by defecting unless stock is exceptionally high.

---

### **Rationale:**

- **Sustainability:** Cooperate when the resource is healthy to ensure long-term sustainability and growth.
- **Rebuilding Efforts:** Cooperate in stressed conditions only if a significant majority are also cooperating, fostering collective rebuilding.
- **Immediate Payoff:** Defect when cooperation is low or near game end to maximize current benefits, especially when future opportunities are limited.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively responding to both resource health and peer behavior.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_494 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on the game's dynamics and players' behaviors. The strategy is designed to sustain the common pool resource while preventing exploitation.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage sustainability and build trust.
2. **Monitor Behavior**: Observe other players' actions over time. If a significant number defect, consider switching strategies to prevent resource depletion.
3. **Adaptive Play**:
   - **Cooperate** if most players are cooperating and the stock is stable or high.
   - **Defect** if many players defect and the stock is low to avoid further depletion.
4. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last few rounds, switch to defecting more frequently to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, past_actions):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = get_capacity()

    if round_number <= 2:  # First few rounds
        return 'C'
    
    recent_past = past_actions[-min(5, len(past_actions)):]  # Look at last 5 rounds or fewer
    
    # Count cooperation in recent past
    num_coop = sum(1 for actions in recent_past for a in actions if a == 'C')
    total_actions = n * len(recent_past)
    
    # Percentage of cooperative actions
    coop_ratio = num_coop / total_actions if total_actions > 0 else 1.0

    stock_depletion = capacity - current_stock

    if round_number >= total_rounds - 2:  # Last few rounds
        return 'D'
    
    if coop_ratio > 0.7 and current_stock > capacity * 0.6:
        # If most are cooperating and stock is healthy
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < capacity * 0.4 or (stock_depletion / capacity) > 0.5:
        # Stock is low, prevent further crash by defecting to signal
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Mix based on others' behavior
        if coop_ratio > 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage in each round:
action = decide_action(current_round, r, stock_level, history_of_actions)
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to maintain the resource and encourage others to do the same.
- **Behavior Monitoring**: By observing past actions, the strategy adapts. If most players cooperate, it continues cooperating; if many defect, it responds accordingly.
- **Stock Consideration**: The decision considers the current stock level, switching to defection when necessary to prevent depletion or signal others to conserve resources.
- **Endgame Adjustment**: Recognizing that future payoffs are limited in the last few rounds, the strategy prioritizes immediate gains through defection.

This approach balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically to other players' strategies and the game's evolving state.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_495 = '''
To address the problem, we need to design a robust and adaptive strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by observing the state (current stock level) and history (past actions affecting the stock). The solution involves dynamically adjusting behavior based on these factors.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first few rounds to establish a baseline of trust and encourage others to do the same, promoting higher payoffs for all.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track changes in the stock level from round to round. This helps determine if cooperation is effective or if defects are occurring.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds:**
   - If the current_stock is above 75% of capacity, continue Cooperating as it indicates a healthy resource level.
   - If the current_stock drops below 25% of capacity, switch to Cooperating again to allow recovery and avoid depleting the resource.

4. **Adaptive Defection in Mid Range:**
   - When the stock is between 25% and 75% of capacity, defect to reduce consumption and potentially encourage others to do the same, thereby conserving the resource for future rounds.

5. **Late Game Adjustment:** As rounds near the end (last few), prioritize immediate payoffs by defecting more frequently since there's no future benefit to preserving the stock.

**Final Answer:**

The strategy is a balance of cooperation and defection based on current stock levels, encouraging sustainability while adapting to observed behavior. Here’s the structured approach:

- **Cooperate** when the current_stock exceeds 75% of capacity.
- **Defect** when the current_stock is between 25% and 75% of capacity.
- **Cooperate** again if the stock falls below 25% to allow recovery.

This strategy ensures resource sustainability while responding to observed trends in stock levels. 

$\boxed{\text{Use a threshold-based strategy where cooperation occurs above 75% and below 25% of capacity, defecting otherwise.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_496 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance resource sustainability with individual payoff maximization. It adapts dynamically based on the game state, historical cooperation rates, and the number of rounds remaining.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 75% of capacity. This sets a positive precedent for resource conservation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Observe current stock (S) and the cooperation rate from previous rounds.
   - Calculate a dynamic threshold based on S, rounds remaining, and past cooperation rates.
   - Cooperate if S exceeds this threshold; otherwise, Defect.

3. **Adjusting Thresholds:**
   - If the historical cooperation rate is high (>50%), slightly decrease the threshold to encourage more Cooperation.
   - If the cooperation rate is low (<30%), increase the threshold to prompt others to Cooperate.

4. **Endgame Considerations:**
   - Gradually lower the threshold as rounds progress towards the end, prioritizing immediate gains in later stages.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate due to maximum stock.
   - In the last few rounds, be more inclined to Defect for higher immediate payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```pseudocode
function decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, history_cooperation_rate):
    if round_number == 1:
        return C

    threshold = initial_threshold * capacity
    threshold_adjustment = 0.75 - (round_number / total_rounds) * 0.25
    adjusted_threshold = threshold + threshold_adjustment

    if current_stock > adjusted_threshold:
        action = C
    else:
        action = D

    # Adjust for cooperation rate in previous rounds
    if history_cooperation_rate > 50%:
        adjusted_threshold *= 0.95
    elif history_cooperation_rate < 30%:
        adjusted_threshold *= 1.05

    return C if current_stock > adjusted_threshold else D
```

### Key Considerations:

- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust thresholds based on rounds remaining and historical cooperation to balance resource use.
- **Collective Behavior:** Encourage Cooperation by mirroring others' actions, fostering a cooperative environment.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Shift towards Defection in later rounds to maximize immediate payoffs.

This strategy aims to sustain the common pool resource while adapting to different opponent behaviors, ensuring both individual and collective benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_497 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource while protecting against exploitation by other players, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on current conditions. The strategy starts with cooperation to maintain a high stock level but adapts by defecting if either the stock is in danger or too many opponents are defecting. In the final round, defecting maximizes immediate payoff.

### Approach

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating to preserve the resource.
2. **Adaptive Play**:
   - Monitor the current stock level after each round.
   - Track the recent defection rate among opponents.
   - If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) or if more than 30% of opponents have recently defected, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds.
3. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, defect to maximize your payoff since future rounds do not exist.

### Solution Code

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_history, opponent_actions):
    capacity = 100  # Example capacity; adjust based on actual game parameters
    n_players = len(opponent_actions[0]) + 1  # Including self
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        current_stock = stock_history[-1]
        critical_level = capacity * 0.5  # Critical threshold
        
        # Check if stock is below the critical level
        if current_stock < critical_level:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Determine recent defection rate among opponents
            k_recent = min(2, len(opponent_actions))  # Look back at last 2 rounds
            total_defects = sum([action.count('D') for action in opponent_actions[-k_recent:]])
            defect_rate = total_defects / (n_players * k_recent)
            
            if defect_rate > 0.3:  # If more than 30% recent defects, defect
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
    
    # For the last round, always defect
    if round_number == len(stock_history):
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by cooperating to maintain a high stock level, encouraging others to do the same.
- **Stock Monitoring**: After each round, the current stock is checked. If it drops below 50% of capacity, indicating potential overuse, the player defects to prevent further depletion.
- **Defection Rate Tracking**: The strategy monitors how many opponents have defected in recent rounds. If more than 30% of opponents are defecting, the player also defects to avoid being exploited and to maximize their payoff.
- **Final Round Handling**: In the last round, the player defects to ensure maximum immediate gain since there are no future rounds left.

This approach ensures that the player adapts to changing conditions, balancing between maintaining the resource for sustainability and protecting against exploitation by other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_498 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for each player in this game, we consider the following steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players cooperate to maintain the resource level at capacity.

2. **Monitor for Defection**: For each subsequent round before the last, players check if the stock has remained at capacity. If it has, they continue cooperating; otherwise, they defect.

3. **Final Round Defection**: Regardless of prior cooperation, in the final round, all players defect to maximize their individual payoffs without worrying about future consequences.

**Answer:**

Each player will cooperate in all rounds except the last one, where they will defect. Thus, the strategy is:

- Cooperate in every round except the final one.
  
In LaTeX notation, the optimal strategy for each player can be expressed as:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate until the last round, then defect}}$

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to balance cooperation with defection based on observed game dynamics, ensuring sustainability and maximizing payoffs.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: Cooperate or Defect?**
- **Initial Rounds (First Round):** Always Cooperate to encourage resource stability.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - **Cooperate** if the remaining stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity) and defection rates are low.
  - **Defect** if the stock falls below the critical threshold or if a significant number of players defect in recent rounds.

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Few Rounds (Final 10% of rounds):** Consider defecting to maximize individual payoffs as future cooperation is unlikely.
- **Low Stock Levels (<25% Capacity):** Defect to prevent further depletion and secure higher immediate gains.

### **3. Adaptive Mechanisms**
- **Thresholds:** 
  - Critical stock level: 25% of capacity.
  - Defection threshold: If more than 30% of players defect in recent rounds, switch to Defecting.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Track the remaining stock after each round's consumption and growth. If it consistently falls below sustainable levels, adjust strategy towards defection.

### **4. Pseudocode Implementation**
```python
def decision_rule(current_stock, history, n, capacity, r):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Calculate recent rounds to consider (e.g., last 5 rounds)
    recent_history = history[-min(len(history), 5):]
    total_defectors = sum([sum(actions == 'D') for actions in recent_history])
    avg_defectors_per_round = total_defectors / len(recent_history) if recent_history else 0
    
    # Check stock after last round's consumption and growth
    last_stock_after = history[-1]['stock_after']
    
    # Decision logic
    if last_stock_after < capacity * 0.25:
        return "Defect"
    elif avg_defectors_per_round > n * 0.3:  # If >30% defect recently
        return "Defect"
    else:
        # Check if current stock is sustainable
        if current_stock >= capacity * 0.5:  # Sustainable level
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Defect"
```

### **5. Robustness and Adaptability**
- The strategy adapts based on observed defection rates and stock levels, ensuring it can respond to various player behaviors without relying on coordination.
- By monitoring both consumption patterns and stock dynamics, the strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

This strategy aims to maximize collective payoffs while being resilient to different opponent strategies, ensuring adaptability across a wide range of game conditions.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize collective payoff while ensuring sustainable use of the common pool. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to maintain high stock levels and set a baseline for sustainability.

2. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - **High Stock (Above 80% Capacity)**: Allow defection, but limit it to prevent excessive depletion.
   - **Low Stock (Below 60% Capacity)**: Enforce cooperation to rebuild the resource.

3. **Reciprocity and Adaptation**:
   - Monitor past actions of other players. If most have cooperated recently, continue cooperating.
   - If many defect, consider defecting but avoid overexploitation to prevent collapse.

4. **Endgame Handling**:
   - In the last few rounds, focus on cooperation to maintain sustainability unless forced otherwise by others' defection.

5. **Critical Stock Management**:
   - If stock drops below 30%, strictly enforce cooperation to allow recovery through growth.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decision_rule(current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    # Initial round: Cooperate to maintain high stock
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check current stock relative to capacity
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    
    # Define thresholds dynamically based on stock and history
    cooperation_threshold = max(0.6, min(0.8, (current_stock + growth)/capacity))
    
    # Determine if others have mostly cooperated recently
    recent_coop = sum([1 for action in history[-5:] if action == 'C']) / 5
    
    # Decision logic
    if stock_ratio > cooperation_threshold:
        # Allow some defection but not too much
        if random.random() < 0.3 * (1 - recent_coop):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif stock_ratio <= cooperation_threshold and stock_ratio >= 0.6:
        # Encourage cooperation based on others' behavior
        if recent_coop > 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        # Strict cooperation to rebuild stock
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Ensures the game starts with a stable resource level.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust based on current stock and historical context, promoting sustainable use.
- **Reciprocity**: Encourages mutual cooperation by adapting to others' actions, fostering a cooperative environment.
- **Endgame Handling**: Maintains sustainability focus even in later rounds to avoid abrupt collapses.
- **Critical Stock Management**: Ensures recovery when the resource is severely depleted.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors and ensuring collective success.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_501 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategic approach that focuses on maintaining sustainability by monitoring the stock level. Here's a structured summary:

### Approach
1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to maintain a high initial stock, promoting resource sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Last Round Check**: If it is the last round, defect to maximize immediate gain since there are no future rounds.
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: Establish a safe threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity). 
     - **Above Threshold**: Cooperate to sustain the resource and ensure long-term benefits.
     - **Below or Equal Threshold**: Defect to maximize gains as the resource is already stressed.

This strategy prioritizes the common resource state over individual actions, promoting a sustainable approach while being robust against varying opponent behaviors.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, previous_actions):
    # First round: Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # Last round: Defect
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'Defect'
    
    # Safe threshold is set at 50% of capacity
    safe_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    # If current stock is above the safe threshold, Cooperate
    if current_stock > safe_threshold:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, we maintain a high stock level, encouraging sustainable resource use.
- **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: The strategy uses a fixed threshold to decide actions based on the current stock. This ensures that resources are used sustainably when possible and exploited when necessary.
- **Adaptation to Final Round**: Recognizing the final round allows players to defect without worrying about future consequences, optimizing immediate gains.

This approach balances sustainability with individual gain optimization, making it robust against varying behaviors in multi-player settings.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_502 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining sustainable cooperation in a multi-round game where each player's decision affects shared resources, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances resource health with social cooperation. This strategy dynamically adjusts based on current conditions and historical behavior.

### Approach
The approach involves three key components:

1. **Current Stock Check**: Evaluate whether the stock level is sufficient to support sustainable cooperation.
2. **Recent Cooperation Rate**: Assess the proportion of players who have Cooperated in recent rounds to gauge collaborative willingness.
3. **Recovery Mechanism**: Address extreme cases where the resource is severely depleted by temporarily prioritizing cooperation.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Action (First Round)**: 
   - **Cooperate** to start with a positive action that supports resource health and sets a cooperative tone.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Check for Severe Depletion**: If the current stock level \( S \) is below 30% of capacity (\( T_{\text{recovery}} = 0.3 \times \text{capacity} \)), enter a recovery phase.
     - In recovery mode, **Cooperate** for the next two rounds to attempt rebuilding the resource, regardless of others' actions.

   - **Assess Stock and Cooperation Rate**: If \( S \) is above 60% of capacity (\( T = 0.6 \times \text{capacity} \)) and at least 70% of players Cooperated in the last three rounds, **Cooperate**.
     - This threshold ensures cooperation occurs when both resource health and social willingness are sufficient.

   - **Defect Otherwise**: If either the stock is too low or insufficient others Cooperate, **Defect** to maximize immediate payoff while avoiding further depletion.

### Edge Cases Handling
- **First Round**: Always **Cooperate** to encourage a positive start.
- **Last Round**: Apply the same decision rules; though there's no future beyond this round, maintaining cooperative behavior supports sustainability in hypothetical extensions.
- **Extreme Low Stock**: Use recovery mode to break cycles of mutual defection and rebuild resource levels.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, recent_coop_history):
    """
    Determines whether to Cooperate or Defect based on current stock level,
    capacity, and recent cooperation history.
    
    Parameters:

        capacity (float): Maximum possible value of the shared resource.
        recent_coop_history (list of floats): List containing the proportion
            of Cooperators in each of the last few rounds.
            
    Returns:
        str: 'Cooperate' or 'Defect'
    """
    T_recovery = 0.3 * capacity
    recovery_rounds = 2
    T = 0.6 * capacity
    P = 0.7
    
    # Check if we need to enter recovery mode
    if current_stock < T_recovery:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # Calculate the average cooperation rate in recent rounds
    avg_coop = sum(recent_coop_history) / len(recent_coop_history)
    
    # Decision based on stock and cooperation rate
    if current_stock >= T and avg_coop >= P:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
The strategy is designed to maintain sustainability by only Cooperating when it's safe for the resource and others are likely to do so. It includes a recovery mechanism to handle extreme low stock situations, encouraging others to also Cooperate. By dynamically adjusting based on current conditions and historical behavior, this approach promotes long-term collaborative outcomes while protecting against exploitation by Defectors.

This solution effectively balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, ensuring that cooperation is both rewarding and resilient against disruptions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_503 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a structured collective strategy that balances cooperation for sustainability and defection to maximize payoffs. Here's how it works:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Early Game Strategy (First Half of the Rounds):**
   - **Cooperate** if the stock level (S) is above 80% of capacity.
   - **Defect** otherwise.

2. **Middle Game Strategy (Second Quarter to Three-Quarters Through):**
   - **Cooperate** if S exceeds 70%.
   - **Defect** otherwise.
   - Implement **hysteresis**: Continue the previous action for one additional round if crossing the threshold, preventing rapid switching.

3. **Late Game Strategy (Last Quarter of Rounds):**
   - Always **defect** to prioritize immediate payoffs with limited time left for regrowth.

### Final Answer

The strategy is as follows:

- In the **first half**, cooperate when S > 80%, else defect.
- From **second quarter to three-quarters**, cooperate if S > 70%; use hysteresis to avoid rapid switching.
- In the **last quarter**, always defect.

This approach ensures sustainable resource management while adapting to depletion and maximizing payoffs near the end. The strategy is encapsulated as:

\boxed{
\text{Cooperate when } S > \begin{cases} 
80\% & \text{(Early Game)} \\
70\% & \text{(Middle Game)}
\end{cases}
\text{; else defect. Always defect in Late Game. Use hysteresis in Middle Game.}
}

### Final Answer

The optimal strategy is:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when } S > 80\% \text{ (Early), } 70\% \text{ (Middle); Defect otherwise and always in Late Game.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_504 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with resource sustainability in an anonymous, multi-player setting without communication, we propose a strategy based on observing the current stock level relative to a predetermined threshold.

**Strategy:**

- **Cooperate:** If the current stock level is greater than half of the maximum capacity (i.e., stock > capacity / 2).
- **Defect:** Otherwise.

This approach encourages cooperation when resources are abundant, fostering sustainability. When the resource depletes below this threshold, players switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains, acknowledging that further cooperation may no longer sustain the resource adequately.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine Threshold:** Set the threshold at half of the maximum capacity (capacity / 2).
2. **Current Stock Check:** At each decision point, observe the current stock level.
3. **Decision Making:**
   - If stock > capacity / 2 → Cooperate.
   - Else → Defect.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate when the resource stock exceeds half of its maximum capacity and defect otherwise. 

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock} > \frac{\text{capacity}}{2}, \text{else defect}}$

description_COLLECTIVE_505 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection when necessary. The strategy adapts dynamically based on the current stock level, remaining rounds, and historical cooperation rates.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to maintain the resource.
2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Use a threshold that decreases as the game progresses, balancing between sustaining the resource and maximizing individual payoffs.
3. **Stock Level Monitoring**: Cooperate if the stock is above a certain threshold relative to capacity; defect otherwise.
4. **Cooperation Rate Consideration**: Cooperate more if historical cooperation rates are high, especially when many rounds remain.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**: Always cooperate to promote resource sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the dynamic threshold: `threshold = max(0.5, 0.8 - (round_number / r))`.
   - If the stock level is above `capacity * threshold` and historical cooperation rates are high (>50%), cooperate.
   - Otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

### Edge Cases:

- **Last Round**: Defect to capture maximum payoff since there's no future benefit from sustaining the resource.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Defect to exploit remaining resources before potential collapse.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, remaining_rounds, stock_level, history_cooperation):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        threshold = max(0.5, 0.8 - (round_number / remaining_rounds))
        
        if stock_level > capacity * threshold:
            cooperation_rate = average_coop_rate(history_cooperation)
            if cooperation_rate > 50% or remaining_rounds > r / 2:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            return 'D'

def average_coop_rate(history):
    total_coop = sum(1 for action in history if action == 'C')
    return (total_coop / len(history)) * 100
```

### Explanation:

- **Dynamic Threshold**: The threshold starts high (e.g., 80% of capacity) and decreases as rounds progress, encouraging cooperation early on.
- **Cooperation Rate Check**: If others have been cooperating significantly (>50%), continue to cooperate to sustain the resource.
- **Stock Level Check**: Cooperate only if the stock is above a critical threshold; defect otherwise to exploit resources.

This strategy ensures adaptability to changing conditions and opponent behaviors, promoting long-term sustainability while responding to potential defection.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Strategy Overview:**
The strategy aims to maximize long-term payoffs by balancing cooperation for sustainable resource management with defection when necessary. It adapts based on historical cooperation rates and current stock levels.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Round Action:**
   - Start by Cooperating (C) in the first round to encourage others to do the same, promoting a sustainable initial state.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation:**
   - After each round, calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated.
   - Track changes in stock levels to assess sustainability trends.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If more than 50% of players Cooperated in the previous round and the current stock is above a moderate threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), continue Cooperating.
   - **Defection Response:** If defection is prevalent (less than 50% cooperation) or the stock is low (below 40% of capacity), switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate gains.

4. **Stock Level Considerations:**
   - High Stock (>80% capacity): Strongly encourage Cooperation to maintain resource health.
   - Moderate Stock (40%-80%): Use cooperation threshold to decide, promoting sustainability when possible.
   - Low Stock (<40%): Prioritize Defection to capitalize on remaining resources before potential collapse.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Consider defecting more frequently to maximize short-term gains if the stock is expected to deplete anyway.
   - **Stock Crash Prevention:** If stock drops critically low, consider cooperative actions to prevent complete depletion in subsequent rounds.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history_cooperation, current_stock, capacity):
    cooperation_threshold = 0.5
    high_stock = 0.8 * capacity
    moderate_stock_low = 0.4 * capacity

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        prev_coop = sum(history_cooperation[-1]) / len(history_cooperation[-1])
        
        if current_stock > high_stock and prev_coop > cooperation_threshold:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock < moderate_stock_low or prev_coop <= cooperation_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Adjust based on stock trends
            if current_stock < 0.6 * capacity:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'

# Example usage in a tournament setting
for each_round in range(r):
    action = decide_action(each_round, history_of_cooperation, current_stock_value, capacity)
    # Submit action to the game server
```

**Conclusion:**
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on historical cooperation and stock levels. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection when necessary, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_507 = '''
To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing your individual payoff in an environment where you can either Cooperate (C) or Defect (D). The goal is to balance cooperation with defection to prevent over-consumption of resources, which would lead to lower payoffs for everyone.

### Approach
The solution involves setting a threshold based on the current stock level. Here's the strategy:

1. **Cooperate if the current stock is above 50% of its capacity**: This encourages sustainable consumption and prevents sudden collapses.
2. **Defect if the current stock is at or below 50% of its capacity**: This allows you to maximize your payoff when resources are scarce, preventing over-reliance on cooperation that might not be reciprocated.

This approach ensures that you contribute to maintaining resource levels when they are sufficient but also take advantage of opportunities to defect when necessary, balancing the need for sustainability with individual gain.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(stock_level, capacity):
    if stock_level > 0.5 * capacity:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"
```

### Explanation
- **Cooperate (C)**: When the stock level is above half of its capacity, Cooperating helps maintain a sustainable resource level. This strategy prevents the abrupt collapse of resources and ensures that future payoffs remain stable.
  
- **Defect (D)**: If the stock level drops to or below half of its capacity, Defecting allows you to maximize your immediate payoff. This action can be critical in preventing over-consumption by others and ensuring that you secure as much resource as possible before it runs out.

By following this strategy, you balance cooperation with defection effectively, leading to higher individual payoffs while maintaining a sustainable use of resources when possible.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_508 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock and Majority Action**

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to encourage sustainability and build trust among players.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**: Decision is based on two factors:
   - The current stock level relative to capacity.
   - The majority action in the previous round.

3. **Decision Rules**:
   - If the current stock (S) > 70% of capacity and the majority action last round was Cooperate, then Cooperate.
   - If S < 30% of capacity or the majority action last round was Defect, then Defect.
   - In all other cases, mirror the majority action from the previous round:
     - If majority was Cooperate, Cooperate.
     - If majority was Defect, Defect.

**Rationale**:

- **High Stock (S > 70%)**: Maintain cooperation to sustain resource levels and ensure long-term payoffs. Encourages others to continue cooperating by demonstrating trust in the system.

- **Low Stock (S < 30%)**: Switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains, as the resource is already severely depleted and may not recover regardless of actions.

- **Middle Stock (30% ≤ S ≤ 70%)**: Follow the majority action to align with group behavior. If others cooperate, support sustainability; if they defect, prevent being exploited by joining in.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource management, adapting to both cooperative and defective behaviors of other players while ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_509 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation for resource sustainability with defecting for immediate gains, a threshold-based strategy is employed. This strategy ensures that cooperation continues as long as the resource level remains above a specified threshold, promoting future growth. If the resource drops below this threshold, defection is chosen to maximize current benefits.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Set Threshold:** Define a threshold (T) at 50% of the maximum capacity. This ensures cooperation when the resource is sufficiently abundant.
2. **Evaluate Current Stock:** Check if the current stock (S) meets or exceeds T.
3. **Decide Action:**
   - If S ≥ T, choose to cooperate, contributing less to immediate consumption but supporting long-term resource health.
   - If S < T, defect to maximize personal gain before potential resource depletion.

**Answer:**

The AI player will employ a threshold-based strategy where it cooperates when the current stock is at least 50% of capacity and defects otherwise. This approach balances sustainability with immediate gains.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock is at least 50\% of maximum capacity; else defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_510 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on the current stock level. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Decision Rules**:
   - Players Cooperate (C) when the current stock (S) exceeds 70% of capacity.
   - Players Defect (D) when S is below 30% of capacity.
   - Between 30% and 70%, players Cooperate with a probability that decreases linearly as S approaches 30%.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Start by Cooperating since the initial stock equals capacity.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 2-3)**: Lower the high threshold to encourage more Defecting, prioritizing immediate gains.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, total_rounds, current_round):
    H = 0.7 * capacity
    L = 0.3 * capacity

    # Adjust thresholds in later rounds
    if (total_rounds - current_round) < 3:
        adjusted_H = 0.5 * capacity  # Lower threshold for endgame
    else:
        adjusted_H = H

    if current_stock >= adjusted_H:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock <= L:
        return 'D'
    else:
        p_coop = (current_stock - L) / (adjusted_H - L)
        if random() < p_coop:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation:
- **Thresholds**: The high threshold (H) starts at 70% but lowers in the final rounds to encourage Defecting. The low threshold (L) remains at 30%.
- **Probability of Cooperating**: In the intermediate range, players decide randomly based on a probability that decreases as S approaches L.
- **Adaptation Over Time**: By adjusting H in later rounds, the strategy shifts towards maximizing immediate gains, balancing between cooperation and defecting.

This approach dynamically adapts to the state of the common pool, encouraging sustainable use early on and prioritizing individual gain near the game's end.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_511 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing individual gain while considering the impact on resource sustainability, we propose a strategic approach that balances defecting for higher immediate rewards with cooperating to maintain the resource for future use. The strategy is based on evaluating the current stock level relative to capacity and making decisions accordingly.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define Thresholds:** Establish two thresholds relative to the total capacity of the resource:
   - A **High Threshold (T_high)** set at 70% of capacity.
   - A **Low Threshold (T_low)** set at 40% of capacity.

2. **Decision Criteria:**
   - If the current stock is above T_high, defecting can be done cautiously to take advantage of the surplus without causing immediate depletion.
   - If the current stock is between T_low and T_high, cooperate to help maintain the resource level.
   - If the current stock is below T_low, defect aggressively as the resource is likely already depleted, and cooperation won't yield significant benefits.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Monitor the stock level in each round.
   - Apply the decision criteria based on the current stock relative to T_high and T_low.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy for maximizing individual gain while considering future sustainability involves conditionally defecting or cooperating based on the resource's current stock level:

- **Defect** when the stock is above 70% of capacity, allowing you to take advantage of surplus without immediate harm.
- **Cooperate** when the stock is between 40% and 70%, helping maintain sustainable levels.
- **Defect aggressively** when the stock drops below 40%, as cooperation at this point yields minimal benefits.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting your strategy to the current state of the resource. 

$\boxed{\text{Conditionally defect or cooperate based on current stock relative to defined thresholds}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_512 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on the observed state of the resource stock.

### Approach
The strategy is designed to be simple yet effective, allowing each player to make decisions based solely on observable state variables without requiring knowledge of other players' strategies or future rounds. The approach involves:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to maintain high stock levels for future growth.
2. **Adaptive Thresholding**: After each subsequent round, check if the S_remaining after consumption is above a certain threshold (80% of capacity). If it is, continue Cooperating; otherwise, switch to Defecting.

This approach ensures that players maximize their immediate payoff while maintaining sustainable resource levels for future rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_s_remaining = None
    
    def action(self, current_round, s_remaining_history, capacity):
        if current_round == 1:
            # Always Cooperate in the first round
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Get the previous round's S remaining after consumption
            prev_s_remaining = s_remaining_history[-2]  # The last element is after current_round-1's action
            threshold = capacity * 0.8
            if prev_s_remaining >= threshold:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, each player starts by Cooperating to ensure a high initial stock level, which benefits future rounds through growth.
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: After the first round, each player checks if the stock remaining after consumption in the previous round was above 80% of capacity. If it was, they continue to Cooperate. If not, they switch to Defecting to maximize their immediate payoff.

This strategy is robust because it adapts based on observable state variables and does not rely on knowing other players' strategies or future rounds. It balances between maintaining a healthy stock level (by Cooperating when possible) and maximizing immediate payoff when the stock is already low.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_513 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, a balanced strategy is needed that promotes cooperation while adapting to changes in the stock level over time. The strategy should encourage sustainability without relying on explicit coordination among players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to maintain a high initial stock and set a positive precedent.
2. **Adaptive Cooperation/Defection**: In subsequent rounds, decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock level relative to capacity and recent trends.
3. **Endgame Adjustment**: As the game approaches its conclusion, prioritize immediate gains by defecting if the stock remains sufficiently high.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C) to maintain the initial high stock.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock is above 70% of capacity and has not shown a significant decrease over the past two rounds, Cooperate.
   - If the stock is below this threshold or shows a downward trend, Defect (D) to maximize immediate gains while signaling others about the need for adjustment.
3. **Endgame Phase**: In the last third of the game, defect if the stock remains above 50% of capacity to prevent future depletion and secure higher individual payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
function decide_action(stock, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return C
    else:
        threshold_high = 0.7 * capacity
        threshold_endgame = 0.5 * capacity
        recent_trend = calculate_recent_trend(history)
        remaining_rounds = total_rounds - round_number + 1

        # Check if in endgame phase
        if remaining_rounds <= total_rounds / 3:
            if stock > threshold_endgame:
                return D
            else:
                return C

        # Decision based on current stock and trend
        if stock >= threshold_high and recent_trend >= -0.1 * capacity:
            return C
        else:
            return D
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Ensures the game starts with a high stock, promoting sustainability.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Monitors stock levels and trends to decide between cooperation and defection, balancing immediate gains against long-term sustainability.
- **Endgame Adjustment**: Recognizes that near the end of the game, players are less incentivized to maintain the stock for future rounds, so defecting becomes more viable if the stock is still high enough.

This strategy adapts dynamically to changes in the game state, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary, without relying on explicit coordination among players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_514 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability in a competitive setting, an AI can employ a strategic approach that adapts based on current stock levels and past actions of other players. Here's a structured summary of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating to maintain high stock levels and encourage others to follow suit.
2. **Stock Level Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
3. **Adaptive Thresholding:**
   - If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity), continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold but remains above another critical point (e.g., 50%), consider the proportion of Defectors in recent rounds.
4. **Defector Proportion Check:** Use a majority rule based on recent history—if more than half of other players have been Defecting, switch to Defecting; otherwise, maintain Cooperation.
5. **Critical Threshold Handling:** If the stock falls below 50% capacity, prioritize immediate payoffs by Defecting to maximize gains before resources are depleted.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Cooperate to establish a high stock level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
   a. **Current Stock Check:** Evaluate if the current stock is above 90% of capacity.
      - If yes, Cooperate.
      - If no, proceed to the next step.
   
   b. **Defector Proportion Analysis:**
      - Calculate the proportion of Defectors in the last k rounds (e.g., k=3).
      - If less than or equal to 50% have been Defecting, Cooperate to encourage resource sustainability.
      - If more than 50% have been Defecting, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoff.

   c. **Critical Stock Level (below 50%):**
      - If the stock drops below 50%, prioritize Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources before depletion.

### Rationale:
- Starting with Cooperation helps maintain resource levels and may encourage mutual cooperation among players.
- Monitoring stock levels ensures that actions are responsive to the current state of resource availability.
- Using a majority rule based on recent Defector behavior allows for adaptability, encouraging continued Cooperation if others are cooperating and switching strategies when necessary.
- A critical threshold at 50% ensures that the AI prioritizes immediate gains when resources are severely depleted, preventing further loss.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to current conditions and historical trends in other players' behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_515 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive strategy that prioritizes long-term sustainability while responding to threats from potential overexploitation. The strategy is designed to be robust and effective across a range of scenarios without relying on coordination mechanisms.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation-Defection (ACD)

#### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to establish a baseline of sustainability and allow the resource to recover if necessary.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - The current stock level is above 75% of capacity.
     - The stock has been increasing or stable over the past two rounds.
   - **Defect** if:
     - The current stock level is below 75% of capacity.
     - The stock has been decreasing for two consecutive rounds.

3. **Final Two Rounds (Rounds r-1 and r):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoffs since there are no future consequences.

#### Handling Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to encourage initial sustainability.
- **Last Two Rounds:** Always Defect to capitalize on the remaining resource without concern for depletion's future impact.
- **Threshold at 75% Capacity:** If the stock is exactly at this level, default behavior is determined by the trend:
  - If increasing or stable: Cooperate.
  - If decreasing: Defect.

#### Robustness and Adaptability:

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. By monitoring both the absolute stock level and its trend, players can adapt dynamically to changes caused by other participants' actions. This approach prevents overexploitation while allowing for exploitation in scenarios where others are defecting excessively.

### Summary

The ACD strategy is designed to:
- Start with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base.
- Adaptively switch to defection when the resource is threatened or in the final rounds.
- Maximize payoffs while considering future impacts, except in the last two rounds.

This approach ensures that players contribute to maintaining the resource's health while protecting their interests against potential exploitation.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Cooperative Strategy**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Round):**
   - Cooperate to maximize total payoff and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds to recover payoffs while others may still cooperate.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Monitor opponents' actions. If a player defects, retaliate by defecting in the next round to encourage cooperation and punish defection.

4. **Final Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - Switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoffs, as there are no future rounds for long-term consequences.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** No history; default to Cooperate.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Defect to salvage payoffs with no future impact.
   - **Stock Depletion:** If critically low, defect to maximize remaining payoff.

**Summary Pseudocode:**

```python
current_round = 1
total_rounds = r

while current_round <= total_rounds:
    if current_round == 1:
        action = Cooperate()
    else:
        stock_level = get_current_stock()
        if stock_level > 0.8 * capacity:
            action = Cooperate()
        else:
            defect_count = count_defectors(history)
            if defect_count > threshold:
                action = Defect()
            else:
                action = Cooperate()
    
    # Punishment mechanism
    if current_round > 1 and opponent_defected(last_round):
        action = Defect()
    
    # Final rounds handling
    if current_round >= total_rounds - (0.2 * total_rounds):
        action = Defect()
    
    record_action(action)
    current_round += 1
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponent behaviors and stock levels while ensuring robustness against exploitation.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Cooperation Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The adaptive cooperation strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting behavior based on historical cooperation rates and current stock levels. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Begin with cooperation in the first round to encourage others to do the same, signaling willingness to maintain resource levels.

2. **Monitor Cooperation Levels:**
   - Track the proportion of Cooperate actions from other players in each round using a moving average or weighted sum to smooth out short-term fluctuations.

3. **Adaptive Thresholding:**
   - Calculate a cooperation threshold based on historical data and current stock levels.
   - If the observed cooperation rate exceeds this threshold, cooperate; otherwise, defect.

4. **Stock Consideration:**
   - Incorporate current stock level into decision-making. Lower stock levels may lower the defection threshold, encouraging more cooperation to preserve resources.

5. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - In the last few rounds, be cautious about defection to avoid sudden resource drops that could affect future payoffs, even though immediate gains are a priority.

6. **Reset Mechanism:**
   - If sustained low cooperation leads to significant resource depletion, reset to a more cooperative stance to attempt recovery and prevent collapse.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```python
initialize cooperation_history = []
threshold = 0.5  # Initial threshold

for each round in rounds:
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        other_coop_rate = average(cooperation_history)
        stock_weight = current_stock / capacity
        adjusted_threshold = threshold * (1 - stock_weight) + 0.3
        
        if other_coop_rate > adjusted_threshold and current_stock > low_limit:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'
    
    record others' actions in cooperation_history
    update threshold based on recent trends
    
    # Ensure strategy adapts to stock dynamics
    if current_stock < capacity * 0.25:
        threshold += 0.1  # Encourage more cooperation

return total_payoff
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy starts with cooperation to foster a collaborative environment.
- It dynamically adjusts the cooperation threshold using historical data and current stock levels, encouraging cooperation when others do so and resources are sufficient.
- In low-resource situations, it leans towards cooperation to prevent collapse, ensuring long-term sustainability.
- This approach balances immediate gains against future benefits without relying on explicit coordination with other players.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining the health of the common resource pool through adaptive and context-aware decision-making.

description_COLLECTIVE_518 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for playing this game, we analyzed the potential outcomes based on whether players Cooperate or Defect. Here's a concise breakdown of the decision-making process:

1. **Cooperate When Stock is Low**: If the current stock (S) is low (≤75% of capacity), Cooperating helps preserve the resource, allowing it to recover through growth in subsequent rounds.

2. **Defect When Stock is High**: If S is high (>75% of capacity), defecting provides a higher immediate payoff without risking an unsustainable crash, assuming others also Defect and the system resets.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to Cooperate when the current stock is less than or equal to 75% of capacity. Otherwise, you should Defect. This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, preventing crashes that would hinder future payoffs.

**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance resource exploitation with preservation, adapting dynamically based on current stock levels and historical outcomes. It encourages cooperation when the common pool is threatened and defection when sustainable.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Threshold**: Start with a base threshold set at 80% of the capacity.
2. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Adjust the threshold each round based on stock growth relative to expected values if all players cooperated or defected.
   - If growth is lower than expected, increase cooperation by lowering the threshold.
3. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last 10% of rounds, linearly increase the threshold towards capacity to encourage defection.

### Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Cooperate to avoid early depletion and allow resource replenishment.
- **Last Few Rounds (Final 10%)**: Shift towards defecting more as long-term sustainability is less critical.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python

    # Adjust threshold based on previous round's stock dynamics

        expected_growth_defect = 2 * (prev_stock - n*(prev_stock/n)) * (1 - (prev_stock - n*(prev_stock/n))/capacity)
        
        actual_growth = stock - prev_stock
        if actual_growth < expected_growth_coop:
            current_threshold *= 0.95  # Lower threshold to encourage cooperation
        elif actual_growth > expected_growth_defect:
            current_threshold *= 1.05  # Higher threshold allows more defection
    
    # For the last 10% of rounds, increase threshold
    if round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        current_threshold = base_threshold + (capacity - base_threshold) * ((round_number - (total_rounds - (total_rounds//10))) / (total_rounds//10))
    
    # Decision based on current stock vs threshold
    if stock <= current_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to build a sustainable resource base.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Modifies the threshold each round to respond to previous outcomes, encouraging cooperation when resources are threatened and allowing defection when safe.
- **Endgame Defection**: As the game nears its end, players shift towards defecting more, capitalizing on remaining resources without long-term sustainability concerns.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining collective resource management, adapting dynamically to different player behaviors and game conditions.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we've devised a strategic approach that balances cooperation for sustainability with defection to mitigate losses. Here's the organized strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy is designed to maximize long-term payoffs while adapting to others' behaviors. It employs cooperation when sustainable and switches to defection when necessary to prevent resource depletion.

### Key Components:

1. **Initial Round Approach:**
   - Start with Cooperate (C) in the first round to encourage a stable resource base and set a cooperative precedent.

2. **Consumption Ratio (CR) Indicator:**
   - Calculate CR as the ratio of defecting players in the previous round.
   - If CR < 50%, continue Cooperating, indicating sustainable behavior.
   - If CR >= 50%, switch to Defecting to protect against over-exploitation.

3. **Stock Threshold Check:**
   - Monitor the current stock level. If it drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), defect to salvage remaining resources.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds, prioritize immediate gains by defecting, as future sustainability is less relevant.

### Decision Rules:
- Cooperate if CR < 50% and stock > threshold.
- Defect if CR >= 50%, stock < threshold, or in the final rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, n, capacity, r):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        last_round = history[-1]
        cr = calculate_consumption_ratio(last_round)
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        
        # Check stock threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity)
        stock_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
        if current_stock < stock_threshold:
            return 'D'
        
        # Check CR and decide
        if cr < 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Check if near the end game
            if round_number >= r - (r * 0.1):
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'D'

def calculate_consumption_ratio(round_data, n):
    total_defectors = sum(1 for action in round_data if action == 'D')
    return total_defectors / n
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base.
- **CR Monitoring:** Adjusts behavior based on previous rounds' defect rates, encouraging others to cooperate by mirroring their actions.
- **Stock Threshold:** Prevents catastrophic depletion by defecting when the stock is critically low.
- **Endgame Defection:** Maximizes payoffs in the final rounds when long-term sustainability is less critical.

This strategy balances individual and collective interests, adapting dynamically to ensure both short-term gains and long-term resource sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_521 = '''
A viable strategy for each player involves balancing cooperation based on the current stock level and recent actions of others. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Round (t = 1):**
   - Cooperate to maintain the resource at a healthy level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (2 ≤ t < r):**
   - **If the current stock is above 80% of capacity:**
     - Cooperate to sustain the resource.
   - **Else if the stock is between 50% and 80%:**
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate among all players in the last three rounds.
     - If at least 60% of these actions were Cooperations, continue Cooperating.
     - Otherwise, Defect to maximize personal gain while the resource is still somewhat healthy.
   - **If the stock is below or equal to 50%:**
     - Always Cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow recovery.

3. **Last Round (t = r):**
   - **If the current stock is above 80% of capacity:**
     - Cooperate as there's no future punishment.
   - **Otherwise:**
     - Defect to maximize personal payoff since there are no subsequent rounds for retaliation.

This strategy aims to maintain a sustainable resource level while adapting to others' behaviors and maximizing individual gains when possible.

\boxed{
\text{Cooperate if the stock is above 80%, between 50%-80% with majority recent cooperation, or below 50%; defect otherwise in final round.}
}

**Note:** The thresholds (80%, 50%) and parameters (last three rounds, 60% cooperation) are chosen to balance sustainability and self-interest based on typical game dynamics. Adjustments can be made depending on specific game conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_522 = '''
To effectively play this game while promoting sustainability and maximizing your payoff over time, you should adopt a cooperative strategy that encourages others to do the same. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Start by Cooperating**: Begin with a Cooperative move to set a positive tone and contribute to sustainable resource use.

2. **Assess Others' Behavior**: Observe the actions of other players in each round. If the majority are Cooperating, continue to Cooperate as this maintains sustainability and mutual benefits.

3. **Punish Defectors**: If you notice that many players are Defecting (e.g., more than half), respond by Defecting yourself. This action signals dissatisfaction with their behavior and incentivizes them to return to Cooperation to avoid depleting the resource for all.

4. **Monitor Sustainability**: Keep track of the total consumption relative to the sustainable limit (capacity/2). If consumption consistently exceeds this, it indicates a need for stronger cooperation measures or reconsideration of your strategy.

By balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability and using cooperative strategies with conditional defection when necessary, you can help maintain a healthy resource level while securing beneficial payoffs over time.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_523 = '''
To address the problem, we'll outline a strategy that balances cooperation for sustainability with defection to maximize immediate gains when necessary. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

### Step 1: Initial Cooperation
- **Action:** Cooperate in the first round.
- **Reasoning:** Starting with cooperation helps maintain or increase the resource level, setting a foundation for sustainable future rounds.

### Step 2: Monitor Stock Levels
- **For each subsequent round (except the last):**
  - Check if the current stock is above 75% of the capacity.
  - If yes, continue Cooperating to sustain the resource.
  - If no, switch to Defecting to maximize individual gain before the resource depletes further.

### Step 3: Final Round Strategy
- **In the last round:** Always Defect.
- **Reasoning:** Since there are no future rounds, defecting maximizes immediate payoff without concern for depleting the resource for others.

### Strategy Summary:
1. Cooperate in the first round to build up the resource.
2. Continue Cooperating as long as the stock remains above 75% of capacity.
3. Switch to Defecting if the stock drops below this threshold, indicating over-consumption by others.
4. In the final round, defect to maximize individual payoff.

### Pseudocode Representation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, total_rounds, capacity):
    # First round: Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Last round: Defect
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    
    # Subsequent rounds until the last
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    if current_stock >= threshold:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"
```

### Final Answer:
The strategy is to initially Cooperate, continue doing so while the resource level remains above 75% of its capacity, switch to Defecting once it falls below that threshold, and always Defect in the final round. This approach balances long-term sustainability with maximizing individual gain when necessary.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{1. Cooperate in the first round.} \\
&\text{2. In subsequent rounds until the last, cooperate if current stock is at least 75\% of capacity; defect otherwise.} \\
&\text{3. Defect in the final round.}
\end{aligned}
}

description_COLLECTIVE_524 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource level while maximizing individual gain, we can implement an adaptive strategy that starts cooperative and becomes more cautious over time. Here's a structured approach:

### Approach
The strategy involves three key components:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the early rounds to encourage others to maintain a high stock.
2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Use a threshold based on the remaining number of rounds, which decreases as the game progresses, allowing more defection later.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Monitor the trend of the stock level (increasing, decreasing, or stable) over recent rounds to decide actions.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, recent_stocks):
    # Set initial cooperation in first 3 rounds
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # Calculate remaining rounds
    remaining = total_rounds - round_number + 1
    
    # Determine threshold adjustment based on remaining rounds
    threshold_adjustment = max(0.5, 0.8 - (0.3 * (remaining / total_rounds)))
    cooperation_threshold = capacity * threshold_adjustment
    
    # Calculate moving average of recent stocks (last 5 rounds)
    window_size = min(len(recent_stocks), 5)
    if window_size == 0:
        moving_avg = current_stock
    else:
        moving_avg = sum(recent_stocks[-window_size:]) / window_size
    
    # Determine trend: compare current stock to previous moving average
    if len(recent_stocks) > 1:
        prev_avg = recent_stocks[-2]
        if current_stock > prev_avg:
            trend = 'increasing'
        elif current_stock < prev_avg:
            trend = 'decreasing'
        else:
            trend = 'stable'
    else:
        trend = 'stable'
    
    # Decision logic
    if remaining <= total_rounds / 10:  # Last 10% of rounds, prioritize immediate gain
        return 'Defect'
    elif current_stock > cooperation_threshold and (trend == 'increasing' or trend == 'stable'):
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'

# Example usage:
capacity = 100
total_rounds = 20
recent_stocks = [100, 100, 100]  # Initial state

for round_number in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    current_stock = get_current_stock()  # Assume this function returns the current stock
    action = determine_action(current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, recent_stocks)
    print(f"Round {round_number}: Action is to {action}")
    update_recent_stocks(recent_stocks, current_stock)  # Update the list with current_stock after action
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by cooperating in the first three rounds to set a cooperative tone.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: As the game progresses, the threshold for cooperation decreases, allowing players to defect more as future payoffs become less valuable.
- **Trend Analysis**: By analyzing the trend of the stock level over recent rounds, the strategy adapts to whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable, adjusting actions accordingly.

This approach balances collective sustainability with individual gain by dynamically adapting based on observed outcomes and remaining game rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_525 = '''
The optimal strategy for an individual player in this game, assuming they are self-interested and aiming to maximize their own gain without considering future rounds or sustainability, is to **always Defect**. This decision is based on the immediate benefits of defecting outweighing the costs when others may also defect, leading to a Nash equilibrium where all players choose to defect.

$\boxed{\text{Defect}}$

description_COLLECTIVE_526 = '''
**Strategy Design for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Play**: 
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate (C). This action sets a positive precedent and preserves the stock level, encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**:
   - **Initial Threshold**: Start with a cooperation threshold set at 80% of the capacity.
   - **Adjustment Mechanism**:
     - After each round, assess historical cooperation rates (the proportion of Cooperations in previous rounds).
     - If historical cooperation rates exceed 70%, incrementally increase the threshold to encourage continued cooperation.
     - If these rates drop below 40%, decrease the threshold to allow more Defectors to stabilize or rebuild the stock.

3. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate (C)** if the current stock is above the dynamic threshold.
   - **Defect (D)** if the stock is below the threshold, prioritizing immediate gains while considering future sustainability.

4. **Endgame Adjustment**:
   - In the final few rounds (e.g., last 5% of total rounds), lower the cooperation threshold to encourage Cooperating, maximizing payoffs without relying on future rounds for rebuilding.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If the stock is very low, even below the threshold, consider Cooperating more to aid in rebuilding.
   - At full capacity, always Cooperate to maximize growth potential.

This strategy adaptively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, promoting cooperation when beneficial while adjusting to different opponent behaviors without requiring prior coordination.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**
Maximize collective payoff by balancing immediate gains with sustainable resource management. The strategy adapts dynamically to game state and opponent behaviors.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Early Rounds (First 25% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** High initial stock allows for sustainable consumption, encouraging others to maintain the resource.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 50% of rounds):**
   - **If** historical cooperation is high (>60%), **Cooperate** to sustain growth.
   - **Else**, **Defect** if current stock is below a moderate threshold (e.g., 60% capacity) to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 25% of rounds):**
   - **If** current stock > 80% capacity, **Cooperate** to maintain.
   - **Else**, **Defect** to exploit remaining resources before depletion.

4. **Stock Threshold-Based Adaptation:**
   - **High Stock (>80% capacity):** Cooperate to encourage growth and sustainability.
   - **Moderate Stock (60-80%):** Decide based on recent cooperation rates; favor cooperate if others have been cooperative, else defect.
   - **Low Stock (<60%):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, considering potential resource collapse.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a sustainable precedent.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Adjust based on stock level; prioritize cooperate if high, defect otherwise.
   - **Stock Near Capacity or Zero:** Cooperate near capacity to maintain; defect near zero as regeneration is minimal.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    # Early rounds: first 25% of total rounds
    if round_number <= total_rounds * 0.25:
        return 'C'
    
    # Middle rounds: next 50%
    elif round_number <= total_rounds * 0.75:
        recent_coop = calculate_recent_cooperation(history, num_rounds=3)
        if current_stock > capacity * 0.8:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock < capacity * 0.6 or recent_coop < 0.4:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C' if random.random() > 0.5 else 'D'
    
    # Late rounds: last 25%
    else:
        if current_stock > capacity * 0.8:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

def calculate_recent_cooperation(history, num_rounds=3):
    recent = history[-num_rounds:]
    coop_count = sum(1 for r in recent if r['action'] == 'C')
    return coop_count / len(recent) if recent else 0
```

**Conclusion:**
This strategy promotes sustainability when possible and adapts to exploit resources when necessary, ensuring robust performance against diverse opponent behaviors. By dynamically adjusting actions based on stock levels and historical cooperation, it balances individual gains with collective resource management.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** To maximize cumulative payoff while maintaining a sustainable common pool resource through adaptive cooperation.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - **Rationale:** Encourages others to cooperate by setting a positive example, promoting sustainability and higher long-term payoffs.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - Determine cooperation based on current stock level and recent cooperation rates.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - **Rationale:** No future rounds for retaliation; maximizing immediate payoff is prioritized.

**Thresholds:**

- **High Threshold (HT):** 75% of capacity
- **Medium Threshold (MT):** 50% of capacity
- **Low Threshold (LT):** 25% of capacity

**Cooperation Rate Tracking:**
- Track the proportion of players who cooperated in the last three rounds.

**Decision Logic for Subsequent Rounds:**

- **Current Stock > HT (75% capacity):**
  - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
    - **Rationale:** Ample resource ensures sustainability; cooperation maintains stable payoffs.

- **MT ≤ Current Stock ≤ HT (25% to 75% capacity):**
  - Check the cooperation rate in the last three rounds.
    - If majority cooperated (≥60%), continue Cooperating (C).
      - **Rationale:** Sustained cooperation supports resource recovery and future payoffs.
    - If less than majority cooperated (<60%), switch to Defecting (D).
      - **Rationale:** Protect against exploitation; higher immediate payoff while others defect.

- **Current Stock < MT (25% capacity):**
  - **Action:** Defect (D)
    - **Rationale:** Low resource levels risk collapse; prioritize immediate payoff over sustainability.

**Edge Cases and Adjustments:**

- If stock approaches LT (25%), consider more cautious defection to prevent rapid depletion.
- In rounds following significant defects, adjust cooperation rates dynamically to respond to potential shifts in opponent strategies.

**Implementation Summary:**

The strategy begins with cooperation to foster a cooperative environment. It adapts based on current resource levels and recent player behavior, balancing immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability. By adjusting actions according to thresholds and cooperation trends, the strategy aims to maximize cumulative payoff while maintaining the common pool resource's health.

```pseudocode
function decide_action(current_stock, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return C
    elif current_round == r:
        return D
    else:
        ht = 0.75 * capacity
        mt = 0.5 * capacity
        lt = 0.25 * capacity
        
        if current_stock > ht:

                return D
        elif current_stock < mt:
            return D
```

**Rationale:**

This strategy encourages sustainable resource use by initially cooperating and maintaining cooperation when the stock is high or others are cooperative. It adapts to defection by defecting, preventing exploitation while considering future rounds' sustainability. In the final round, it defects to maximize immediate payoff, acknowledging no future consequences. This approach balances short-term gains with long-term stability, promoting robust performance against diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_529 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It uses a dynamic threshold approach based on the current stock level and historical trends to decide between Cooperate (C) and Defect (D). Here's the detailed strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

**Objective:** Maintain sustainable consumption by encouraging cooperation when the stock is sufficient, while allowing defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate. This sets a foundation for sustainability and assumes others will follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the dynamic cooperation threshold.
     - The threshold is set at 70% of capacity initially but adjusts based on past stock trends.
   - If the current stock is above the threshold, Cooperate.
   - If below, Defect.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - If the stock is high enough to allow defecting without causing collapse (e.g., stock > 150% of n), Defect to maximize payoff.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate to ensure any remaining stock can recover if possible.

**Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**

- After each round, analyze the change in stock:
  - If the stock increased or remained stable, slightly raise the threshold (e.g., +2%) to encourage more cooperation.
  - If the stock decreased significantly, lower the threshold (e.g., -5%) to prompt conservation.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 30% of capacity), prioritize cooperation in subsequent rounds to prevent collapse.
- **Unexpected Defection:** If opponents' actions lead to rapid depletion, adapt by lowering the threshold earlier to encourage more cautious consumption.

**Implementation:**

```pseudocode
Initialize threshold = 0.7 * capacity

for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        # Calculate adjusted threshold based on past trends
        threshold = adjust_threshold(threshold, previous_stock_changes)
        
        if stock > threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D

    # After taking action, update the stock and track changes
    record_stock_change()
```

**Functions:**

- `adjust_threshold(current_threshold, past_changes)`: Adjusts the threshold by +2% if stock increased or remained stable, -5% if it decreased significantly.
- `record_stock_change()`: Logs the change in stock from each round to inform future adjustments.

This strategy ensures that players adapt dynamically to the state of the resource and past behaviors, promoting cooperation when sustainable and defecting cautiously otherwise. It aims to maintain the common pool's health over multiple rounds while allowing for individual optimization.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_530 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer**

To address the problem of sustaining a common-resource system where each player (AI) can either Cooperate or Defect, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with necessary defection. The goal is to prevent over-depletion while allowing the resource to recover through growth.

### 1. Initialization
- **First Round**: All players Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe initial consumption patterns.

### 2. Monitoring Consumption
- After each round, calculate the total consumption as the difference between the stock before the round and the stock after consumption but before growth.
- Use this to compute the ratio \( R = \frac{\text{total\_consumption}}{\text{current\_stock}/2} \), which indicates how much over-consumption occurred compared to full cooperation.

### 3. Adaptive Thresholds
- **Threshold Calculation**: Adjust the tolerance for over-consumption based on the current stock level:
  - If \( \text{current\_stock} > 0.8 \times \text{capacity} \): Allow higher consumption (tolerant of Defectors).
  - If \( 0.5 \times \text{capacity} < \text{current\_stock} \leq 0.8 \times \text{capacity} \): Use a moderate threshold.
  - If \( \text{current\_stock} \leq 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \): Be stricter on Defectors to prevent further depletion.

### 4. Decision Rule
- **Cooperate**: If the previous round's consumption ratio \( R \) is within the adaptive threshold.
- **Defect**: If \( R \) exceeds the threshold, signaling that too many players are over-consuming. Continue defecting for a set number of rounds or until cooperation resumes.

### 5. Cooldown and Reset
- After defecting, if subsequent consumption ratios drop below the threshold, revert to Cooperating to encourage sustainable use.
- In the final rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds), lower thresholds to promote cooperation despite potential temptation to Defect without future punishment.

### 6. Edge Cases Handling
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Rounds**: Adjust strategies to maintain cooperation, understanding there's no future round for punishment.

### Strategy Summary

The proposed strategy is an adaptive approach where players dynamically adjust their actions based on observed consumption patterns and the current state of the resource. By using thresholds that vary with stock levels and past behavior, the strategy aims to sustain the resource by balancing cooperation and necessary defection.

**Final Answer**

The optimal strategy involves initially Cooperating, then dynamically adjusting between Cooperation and Defection based on observed over-consumption relative to adaptive thresholds tied to the current stock level. This approach prevents over-depletion while allowing the resource to recover through growth, ensuring sustainability in the long term.

\boxed{\text{Adaptive Cooperation-Defection Strategy}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_531 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Initial Round Action:**
- **Cooperate (C):** Start with cooperation to set a positive precedent and maintain the resource level.

**2. Subsequent Rounds Decision Rules:**
   - **Stock Above 75% of Capacity:** Cooperate (C) as there is ample resource to sustain current consumption levels.
   - **Stock Between 25% and 75% of Capacity:** Adjust based on historical cooperation rates:
     - Calculate the weighted average of recent cooperation rates (e.g., over the last few rounds).
     - If the majority have Cooperated, continue Cooperating; otherwise, consider Defecting to prevent potential resource depletion.
   - **Stock Below 25% of Capacity:** Defect (D) temporarily to reduce immediate consumption and allow the resource to recover. Transition back to Cooperate as the stock recovers.

**3. Last Round Consideration:**
- **Cooperate (C):** Despite no future rounds, maintaining cooperation can lead to higher payoffs if all players adhere, preventing a sudden depletion.

**4. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **Near Capacity Stock:** Continue Cooperating since growth is minimal but sustainable.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Use Defecting cautiously to prevent further depletion, encouraging others to do the same until recovery.
- **Oscillation Management:** Implement smoothing factors or consider longer-term trends to avoid rapid strategy changes that could destabilize resource levels.

**5. Historical Cooperation Adjustment:**
- Monitor recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5) to assess cooperation rates.
- Use a threshold (e.g., if over 60% Cooperated recently, continue; else, consider Defecting).

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Pseudocode Outline:**

```pseudocode
for each round from 1 to r:
    if first_round:
        return C
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        cooperation_rate = get_recent_cooperation_rate(5 rounds)
        
        if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
            return C
        elif current_stock < 0.25 * capacity:
            return D
        else:
            if cooperation_rate > 0.6:  // Example threshold
                return C
            else:
                return D

for last_round:
    return C

**Conclusion:**
This strategy balances resource sustainability with adaptability, encouraging cooperation when resources are plentiful and defecting judiciously to prevent over-depletion. It dynamically adjusts based on current stock levels and historical behavior, fostering collective responsibility for the common pool resource.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over r rounds while balancing immediate gains against future sustainability.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to contribute to a sustainable resource level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **If Current Stock > 50% of Capacity:** Cooperate (C) to preserve the resource and allow it to grow.
   - **If Current Stock ≤ 50% of Capacity:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff before potential depletion.

3. **Endgame Adjustment:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds (rounded up), always defect (D) regardless of stock level, as there is limited future impact from depleting the resource.

**Adaptability and Edge Cases:**

- The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the current stock level, encouraging cooperation when sustainable and defecting when necessary.
- Handles edge cases by setting clear thresholds and adjusting behavior in the final rounds to maximize short-term gains.

This approach balances individual gain with collective sustainability, adapting to others' actions through observable stock levels without requiring explicit communication.

description_COLLECTIVE_533 = '''
To address the challenge of promoting sustainable cooperation while managing a shared resource, we propose the following strategy:

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Resource Levels**

1. **Cooperate When Resources Are Abundant:**
   - Cooperate if the current stock \( S \) is above 80% of the maximum capacity (\( 0.8 \times \text{capacity} \)).

2. **Defect When Resources Are Stressed:**
   - Defect if the current stock \( S \) is below or equal to 80% of the maximum capacity.

This strategy aims to encourage cooperation when resources are plentiful, ensuring long-term sustainability, while allowing for defection when resources are strained, which can act as a deterrent against overexploitation. The clear threshold helps in making decisions without requiring complex coordination among players.

**Summary:**

- **Decision Rule:** Cooperate if the current stock \( S > 0.8 \times \text{capacity} \); otherwise, Defect.
- **Objective:** Promote sustainable resource use by maintaining cooperation when resources are abundant and adapting to stress conditions by defecting when necessary.

This approach balances individual gain with collective sustainability, providing a straightforward heuristic for managing shared resources effectively.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_534 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance between conserving the common pool resource (Cooperate) and exploiting it when necessary (Defect), adapting dynamically based on current conditions. Here's a structured approach:

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Phase:**
   - **First 20% of Rounds:** Cooperate to build a healthy stock level.
     - *Rationale:* Starting with cooperation helps maintain the resource, encouraging growth and sustainable use.

2. **Middle Phase: Monitor Stock Trends**
   - **Check Current Stock Level:**
     - If above 80% capacity and growing:
       - Continue Cooperating.
     - If below 50% capacity or declining rapidly:
       - Switch to Defecting to exploit the resource before potential collapse.
   - **Analyze Recent Trends (Past 5 Rounds):**
     - Calculate the moving average of stock levels.
     - If the trend shows consistent growth: Continue Cooperating.
     - If the trend indicates decline despite cooperation: Increase defecting frequency.

3. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - Switch to a higher rate of Defecting.
     - *Rationale:* With limited future rounds, maximizing immediate gains becomes crucial. However, consider moderate cooperation to prevent complete collapse.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round:**
  - Cooperate to start with a healthy stock.
  
- **Last Round(s):**
  - If the stock is low, defect to maximize personal gain.
  - If the stock is still healthy, cooperate to preserve it.

### Implementation Summary

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating for the first 20% of rounds to build a stable resource base.
2. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Use thresholds (80% and 50% capacity) to decide between Cooperate and Defect.
   - Track stock trends over the past 5 rounds to inform strategy adjustments.
3. **Endgame Exploitation:** In the final 10%, prioritize Defecting to maximize payoffs, considering potential resource collapse.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_535 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that balances individual payoff with resource sustainability, we propose an adaptive approach that starts cooperative and adjusts based on stock levels and previous actions. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to maintain high resource levels, encouraging others to do the same.
2. **Monitor Stock Dynamics**: Track stock changes each round to inform future decisions.
3. **Adaptive Thresholding**: Cooperate if the stock is above a dynamic threshold; otherwise, consider defecting, adjusting based on historical trends and opponent behavior.
4. **Endgame Adjustment**: Increase defection tendency in later rounds as future payoffs are irrelevant.

### Decision Rules

1. **Cooperation Threshold**:
   - Set an initial threshold at 75% of capacity.
   - Adjust this threshold dynamically: increase if stock grows, decrease if it depletes.

2. **Action Selection**:
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above the threshold and others have cooperated in previous rounds.
   - Defect if the stock is below the threshold or there's a history of defection by others.

3. **Learning Component**:
   - Gradually increase the probability of defecting based on others' past behavior.
   - Decrease this probability if cooperation leads to resource growth.

### Edge Cases Handling

1. **First Round**: Always cooperate to preserve the resource and encourage collective sustainability.
2. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20%)**: Increase tendency to defect as there's no future payoff beyond these rounds.
3. **Very Low Stock**: If stock is near zero, default to defecting as minimal payoff remains.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
Initialize:
    cooperation_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    learning_rate = 0.1
    defect_prob = 0.0  # Probability of defecting in the next round
    prev_coop_count = 0  # Total cooperations by all players observed so far

For each round t from 1 to r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    if t == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate cooperation rate in previous rounds
        total_prev_actions = (t - 1) * n
        if total_prev_actions > 0:
            prev_coop_rate = prev_coop_count / total_prev_actions
        else:
            prev_coop_rate = 0.0
        
        # Update threshold based on stock trends and cooperation rates
        if current_stock > cooperation_threshold and prev_coop_rate > 0.7:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            # Consider defecting, adjust probability based on learning
            defect_prob = max(defect_prob + (1 - prev_coop_rate) * learning_rate, 0.1)
            
            # Check if it's the last few rounds to encourage defection
            if t > r - 0.2 * r:
                defect_prob += 0.3  # Increase tendency to defect
            
            action = 'D' if random() < defect_prob else 'C'
    
    perform action and observe payoff
    
    # Update cooperation count based on others' actions (if observed)
    # Note: This assumes we can track other players' actions, which is allowed by perfect information
    prev_coop_count += number_of_cooperations_in_current_round()
    
    # Adjust threshold for next round based on current stock change
    after_consumption = current_stock - total_consumption
    new_stock = min(after_consumption + growth, capacity)
    
    if new_stock > current_stock:
        cooperation_threshold = max(cooperation_threshold, 0.9 * current_stock)
    else:
        cooperation_threshold = min(cooperation_threshold, 1.1 * current_stock)
```

### Summary

This strategy begins with cooperation to sustain the resource and adaptively adjusts based on stock levels and previous actions. It incorporates learning by adjusting the likelihood of defection according to others' behavior and game progression. By balancing immediate gains with future sustainability, it aims to maximize individual payoff while preventing resource depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_536 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for balancing immediate payoffs with future sustainability, we consider several factors: initial cooperation, monitoring of cooperation rates, current stock levels, and adjusting behavior near the end of the game.

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first few rounds to build up the stock level and encourage others to cooperate.
2. **Monitoring Cooperation Rate**: Calculate the average cooperation rate over the past few rounds (e.g., 3-5 rounds). This helps determine if others are cooperating, which can influence our decision.
3. **Current Stock Level**: Check if the current stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity). If it is, cooperating is beneficial as growth can sustain future use.
4. **Decision Rules**:
   - Cooperate if both the current stock level is high and the recent cooperation rate is above a threshold (e.g., 60%).
   - Defect otherwise to either maximize immediate payoff or signal dissatisfaction with low cooperation.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - First round: Cooperate unconditionally.
   - Last few rounds: Switch to defecting more as there's no future beyond that.
   - Stock near zero: Try to cooperate to allow growth if possible, but be cautious.

The proposed strategy balances maintaining a healthy stock level with responding to others' behavior and adapts near the game's end. The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially, adjust based on cooperation rate and stock level, defect near end}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_537 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Cooperation Strategy**

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation based on current stock levels, past actions, and the number of remaining rounds. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to maintain high stock levels and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Cooperation Tendency Calculation:** For each round, calculate the tendency to cooperate using:
     - Current Stock Level
     - Number of Cooperators in Previous Rounds
     - Number of Remaining Rounds
   - **Decision Rule:** If the calculated tendency exceeds a dynamic threshold (adjusted based on others' cooperation rates), Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Higher when more players cooperate and lower as rounds progress or stock decreases.
   - Automatically adjusts to respond to observed defection trends.

4. **Last Round Handling:**
   - Default to Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
for each player i in {1, 2, ..., n}:
    initialize cooperation_tendency = high
    for t from 1 to r:
        current_stock = state.stock
        prev_coop_count = count of Cooperate actions from all players in round t-1
        remaining_rounds = r - t + 1

        # Calculate tendency to cooperate
        stock_factor = (current_stock / capacity)
        coop_history_factor = (prev_coop_count / n) if t > 1 else 1.0
        time_factor = (remaining_rounds / r)

        cooperation_tendency = (stock_factor * 2 + coop_history_factor * 2 + time_factor) / 4

        # Determine threshold dynamically based on observed behavior
        threshold = max(0.3, min(0.7, 1 - (prev_defect_count / n)))

        if t == r:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C if cooperation_tendency >= threshold else D

        perform action and record outcome
```

This strategy encourages cooperation when beneficial and adapts to defect when necessary, balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_538 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource while balancing self-interest, we propose a strategy where players conditionally cooperate based on the health of the resource and the cooperation levels observed in previous rounds. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization (First Round):**
   - All players default to Cooperating since there is no prior history.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **Calculate Previous Round's Total Consumption:**
      - For each player, based on their action (C or D), determine their contribution:
         - If C, contribution = Previous_Stock / (2n)
         - If D, contribution = Previous_Stock / n
      - Sum all contributions to get the total consumption.

   b. **Determine Stock Health in the Previous Round:**
      - Compute S_remaining = Previous_Stock - Total_Consumption
      - Define a Threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity). If Previous_Stock > Threshold, classify as healthy; otherwise, under stress.

   c. **Assess Cooperation Rate (C_rate) in the Previous Round:**
      - C_rate = (Number of Cooperators) / n

   d. **Make Decision for Current Round:**
      - **If Stock was healthy last round:**
         - If C_rate >= Target_Cooperation_Rate (e.g., 60%): Cooperate
         - Else: Defect
      - **Else (Stock was under stress):**
         - Cooperate to aid recovery and preservation.

**Answer:**

The strategy involves conditional cooperation based on the stock's health and prior cooperation rates. Players cooperate when the stock is stressed, regardless of others' actions, and conditionally cooperate when the stock is healthy if a sufficient number of players also cooperated. This approach ensures resource sustainability while encouraging mutual responsibility.

$\boxed{\text{Conditional Cooperation Strategy}}$

description_COLLECTIVE_539 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by balancing immediate gains against long-term resource sustainability through adaptive cooperation and defection based on observable game dynamics.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Rationale: Start sustainably to build a healthy stock level and encourage others to cooperate, as initial stock is at maximum capacity.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - Current stock is above a dynamic threshold (adjusts based on remaining rounds).
     - Recent cooperation from other players exceeds 70% in the last 20 rounds.
   - **Defect** otherwise.
     - Rationale: Maintain resource sustainability when conditions are favorable, but switch to defecting if the resource is threatened or others are exploiting it.

3. **Last 10% Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Rationale: No future rounds to consider; maximize immediate payoff since there's no impact on subsequent rounds.

---

### **Dynamic Threshold Calculation:**

- **Formula:** 
  \[
  \text{threshold} = \text{capacity} \times (0.6 + (\text{remaining\_rounds}/\text{total\_rounds}) \times 0.3)
  \]
  - Adjusts the threshold starting at 60% of capacity and decreases as rounds progress, encouraging more defection towards the end.

---

### **Tracking Cooperation:**

- Maintain a moving average of cooperation from other players over the last 20 rounds.
- Use weighted averaging to give more weight to recent actions for quicker adaptation.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to foster sustainability and observe others' initial moves.
- **Last Round(s):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff, recognizing no future impact.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** High cooperation expected; continue Cooperating to sustain resource health.
- **Stock Near 0:** Expect widespread Defection leading to collapse; defect accordingly.

---

### **Rationale and Adaptability:**

- **Balance Immediate vs. Long-term Gain:** Prioritize cooperation when the stock is healthy and others are collaborating, switching to defection as needed to prevent resource depletion or exploit uncooperative players.
- **Adaptation:** Adjust cooperation levels dynamically based on observed trends in stock health and other players' behavior, ensuring robustness against varied opponent strategies.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, remaining_rounds):
    total_rounds = len(history) + remaining_rounds
    
    if remaining_rounds == total_rounds:
        return 'C'  # First round
    
    if remaining_rounds <= 0.1 * total_rounds:
        return 'D'  # Last few rounds
    
    threshold = calculate_threshold(stock, remaining_rounds)
    recent_coop = count_recent_cooperations(history[-20:])  # Recent cooperation rate
    
    if stock > threshold and recent_coop >= 0.7 * n_players:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def calculate_threshold(stock, remaining):
    base = 0.6 * capacity
    decay = (base - 0.3 * capacity) * (remaining / total_rounds)
    threshold = base - decay
    return threshold

def count_recent_cooperations(recent_history):
    cooperation_count = sum(action == 'C' for actions in recent_history for action in actions)
    return cooperation_count / len(recent_history)
```

---

**Conclusion:** This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on current stock levels, historical cooperation trends, and remaining rounds. It ensures long-term sustainability while maximizing individual payoff by responding dynamically to changing game conditions.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to start sustainably and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-10):**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** 
     - If current stock is above 75% of capacity, cooperate.
     - If below this threshold, defect to maximize immediate gains.
   - **Adjustment Based on History:**
     - Track the proportion of cooperation in past rounds. If more than 60% of players cooperated in recent rounds, maintain or slightly raise the threshold (e.g., to 80%). If less than 40%, lower the threshold (e.g., to 70%) to be cautious.
   - **Dynamic Adjustment:** Recalculate the threshold every 5 rounds based on historical cooperation rates.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - Increase defection rate, defecting in at least 70% of these rounds to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If stock is exactly at the threshold, default to cooperation.
   - In case of sudden stock drops due to others' defection, adjust threshold downward for next round.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 10% of total rounds):**

2. **Middle Rounds:**

   - If more than 30% of players Defected in any of these rounds, defect in the next round with increased probability (75%) to punish exploiters and encourage future cooperation.
   - Otherwise, continue Cooperating to sustain resource levels.

3. **Endgame (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - Switch to Defecting more frequently (80% chance) to capitalize on remaining resources without worrying about long-term sustainability.

4. **Stock Collapse Handling:**

---

### **Edge Cases and Considerations**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to start with a full resource pool.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Increase defection rate to capture remaining resources without concern for future rounds.
- **Stock Collapse:** If the stock drops below 25% of capacity, prioritize cooperation to encourage recovery.

### **Collective Mindset Alignment**

This strategy encourages mutual cooperation by punishing excessive defection, aiming to maintain sustainable resource levels. It balances short-term gains with long-term stability, promoting a collective interest in preserving the common pool for all players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_542 = '''
The Adaptive Cooperator strategy is designed to foster sustainable cooperation in the Common Pool Resource Game by dynamically adjusting players' actions based on historical behavior. Here's a structured overview of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperator

1. **Reputation Scores**:
   - Each player assigns reputation scores to others, updating them after each round.
     - +1 for Cooperate (C)
     - -1 for Defect (D)
   - Reputation decay factor (e.g., 0.95) ensures recent actions have more influence.

2. **Trust Threshold**:
   - A dynamic threshold determines trustworthiness.
   - Starts neutral, becoming stricter over rounds to encourage long-term cooperation.
   - Example: Initial threshold = 0; threshold increases by a small factor each round (e.g., +0.1 per round).

3. **Decision Rule**:
   - Cooperate if the average reputation of others ≥ trust threshold.
   - Defect otherwise.

4. **Special Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to set a positive tone and maximize initial stock replenishment.
   - **Last Round**: Consider defecting if beneficial, but default to cooperation for sustainability unless others have consistently defected.

5. **Memory Decay**:
   - Reputation scores decay exponentially to focus on recent behavior.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initialize Parameters**:
   - Set decay factor (e.g., 0.95), initial trust threshold (e.g., 0), and threshold increment per round.

2. **First Round**:
   - All players default to Cooperate.

3. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   a. Update reputation scores based on others' previous actions.
      - Adjust scores using the decay factor.
   b. Calculate average reputation of other players.
   c. Determine trust threshold for this round (initial + increment * round number).
   d. Cooperate if average reputation ≥ trust threshold; otherwise, Defect.

4. **Last Round Handling**:
   - Consider defection if beneficial but default to cooperation unless others have low reputations.

### Benefits and Adaptability

- Encourages mutual cooperation when others are trustworthy.
- Adapts to changing behaviors through dynamic thresholds and decay factors.
- Promotes sustainability by balancing current gains with future stock health.

This strategy effectively navigates the balance between immediate payoff and long-term resource management, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_543 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we propose a strategy that balances sustainability with maximizing immediate gains based on the observed state of the resource and others' behaviors.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase:**
   - Players start by always Cooperating in the initial rounds. This helps build or maintain a healthy stock level, ensuring sustainable growth for future rounds.

2. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Each player tracks the stock level over recent rounds (e.g., the last 3-5 rounds).
   - They assess whether the stock is increasing, stable, or decreasing relative to previous rounds.

3. **Dynamic Threshold-Based Switching:**
   - Players use dynamic thresholds based on current stock levels and historical trends:
     - **Upper Threshold:** If the stock exceeds 80% of capacity (e.g., 80 in a 100-capacity system), players continue Cooperating, as this indicates a sustainable resource.
     - **Lower Threshold:** If the stock drops below 60% of capacity, players switch to Defecting more frequently. This action aims to maximize immediate payoffs when the resource is at risk of depletion.

4. **Mid-Threshold Decision Making:**
   - When the stock is between 60% and 80%, players consider additional indicators:
     - The number of Cooperators in recent rounds.
     - The trend direction (increasing or decreasing) to decide whether to Cooperate or Defect.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., the final 10% of total rounds), players switch to Defecting to maximize their immediate payoffs since there are no future rounds left.
   - If the stock is extremely low (below 30% of capacity), players Defect to capture as much as possible before the resource runs out.

**Final Strategy:**

Players adopt a dynamic strategy that prioritizes sustainability when the resource is healthy but adapts to maximize payoffs when depletion occurs. By monitoring stock trends and others' actions, they balance long-term gains with immediate benefits.

ANSWER:

To address the problem effectively, we propose a strategy that balances sustainability with maximizing immediate gains based on the observed state of the resource and others' behaviors.

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase:**
   - Players start by always Cooperating in the initial rounds to build or maintain a healthy stock level for sustainable growth.

2. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Each player tracks the stock level over recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds) and assesses if it's increasing, stable, or decreasing relative to previous rounds.

3. **Dynamic Threshold-Based Switching:**
   - Players use dynamic thresholds:
     - **Upper Threshold:** If the stock exceeds 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
     - **Lower Threshold:** If below 60%, switch to Defecting more frequently.

4. **Mid-Threshold Decision Making:**
   - Between 60% and 80%, consider additional indicators like the number of Cooperators and trend direction.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - In the last few rounds, switch to Defecting.
   - If stock is extremely low (below 30%), Defect to maximize immediate gain.

**Final Answer:** The optimal strategy involves Cooperating when the resource is healthy (above 80%) and switching to Defecting when it shows signs of depletion (below 60%). This balance maximizes payoffs while maintaining sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_544 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive and robust approach that considers both the current state of the resource and the historical behavior of other players. The strategy is designed to maximize long-term payoffs while ensuring sustainability.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Determine the initial threshold based on the game's capacity.
   - Set a default cooperation proportion for the first round, assuming others might cooperate.

2. **Decision Rules Per Round:**
   - **Threshold Adjustment:** Calculate the current threshold as `initial_threshold * (remaining_rounds / total_rounds)`. This decreases over time, allowing more defects in later rounds.
   - **Stock Check:** Compare the current stock level against the adjusted threshold.
   - **Historical Cooperation Rate:** Assess the proportion of cooperative actions from other players in recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - **Decision Making:**
     - If `current_stock >= threshold` and the cooperation proportion exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 0.5), choose to Cooperate (C).
     - Otherwise, Defect (D).

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Assume high cooperation proportion; if stock is above threshold, cooperate.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** As remaining rounds approach zero, the threshold approaches zero, making defecting more likely to salvage immediate gains.
   - **High Stock Levels:** Always cooperate when near capacity for sustainability.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If recovery is unlikely despite cooperation, switch to defecting in later rounds.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    # Initialize parameters
    initial_threshold = 0.8 * capacity  # Example value
    remaining_rounds = total_rounds - round_number + 1
    threshold = initial_threshold * (remaining_rounds / total_rounds)
    
    # Determine cooperation proportion from recent history
    if round_number == 1:
        cooperation_proportion = 1.0  # Assume others will cooperate initially
    else:
        relevant_history = history[-5:]  # Consider last 5 rounds or fewer
        cooperation_count = sum(1 for action in relevant_history if action == 'C')
        cooperation_proportion = cooperation_count / len(relevant_history)
    
    # Decision rules
    if current_stock >= threshold and cooperation_proportion > 0.5:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold decreases as the game progresses, balancing long-term sustainability with immediate gains.
- **Historical Cooperation Rate:** By observing past actions, the strategy adapts to shifts in other players' behavior, promoting reciprocity when beneficial.
- **Edge Cases:** The strategy handles critical points like the first and last rounds gracefully, ensuring robust performance across different scenarios.

This approach ensures that the strategy is both adaptive and sustainable, capable of handling a wide range of opponent behaviors while maintaining long-term resource health.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_545 = '''
**Final Answer:**

The collective strategy for the AI in this game is as follows:

1. **Cooperate** if both conditions are met:
   - The current stock \( S \) is at least 70% of the maximum capacity.
   - In the last 3 rounds, more than 60% of all actions were Cooperate.

2. **Defect** otherwise.

This strategy balances maintaining a sustainable resource level with responding to recent cooperation trends among players.

**Edge Cases:**
- In the first round, since there is no history, the AI will **Cooperate**.
- In the last few rounds (e.g., the final 5% of the game), if applicable, the AI might adjust its strategy to maximize immediate gains, potentially defecting more frequently, but this adjustment depends on specific game parameters.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S \geq 0.7 \times \text{capacity and last 3 rounds have >60% Cooperate; else Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_546 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, a strategic approach that balances cooperation and defection based on dynamic conditions is essential. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy begins with cooperation to encourage sustainability and build trust. It dynamically adjusts actions based on stock health and opponents' behavior, using thresholds to decide when to switch from cooperation to defection.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Rounds**: Start with cooperation to maintain resource levels and promote a cooperative environment.
2. **Stock Health Assessment**:
   - If the current stock is below 80% of capacity, assess it as 'bad' and consider defecting.
3. **Opponent Behavior Analysis**:
   - Monitor defection rates from previous rounds. High defection rates (over 50%) indicate a need to adjust trust levels downward.
4. **Trust Level Adjustment**:
   - Begin with high trust (100%). Decrease trust by 10% if defection rates exceed 50%, and slightly increase or maintain trust otherwise.
5. **Action Selection**:
   - Cooperate if stock health is good and trust level exceeds 70%.
   - Defect if stock health is bad or trust level drops below 30%.
   - Use a mixed strategy when in between, choosing cooperation probabilistically based on the remaining trust level.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to encourage sustainability and set a positive precedent.
- **Last Round (unknown)**: Focus on sustainability unless stock depletion necessitates defection.
- **Stock Near Capacity**: Continue Cooperating if everyone is cooperating, as it sustains resource levels.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
Initialize:
    trust_level = 100%
    stock_threshold = 0.8 * capacity

For each round from 1 to r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    # Assess stock health
    if current_round > 1 and current_stock < (initial_capacity * stock_threshold):
        stock_health = 'bad'
    else:
        stock_health = 'good'
    
    # Check opponents' recent behavior
    num_defectors_last_round = count_defectors(last_actions)
    defection_rate = num_defectors_last_round / n
    
    # Update trust level based on past rounds
    if current_round > 1 and defection_rate > 0.5:
        trust_level *= 0.9  # decrease trust by 10%
    else:
        trust_level *= 1.01  # slightly increase or maintain trust
    
    # Decision rules
    if stock_health == 'good' and trust_level > 70:
        action = C
    elif stock_health == 'bad' or trust_level < 30:
        action = D
    else:
        # Mixed strategy based on remaining trust level
        if random() < (trust_level / 100):
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    
    # Record the action for history
    record_action(action)
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy dynamically adapts to changing conditions, balancing cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection when necessary. By monitoring stock levels and opponents' actions, it aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining a healthy resource pool.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_547 = '''
To design a robust strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts to various opponent behaviors while maximizing collective payoff, we can outline the following approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy begins by fostering cooperation to maintain a healthy stock level. It then dynamically adjusts based on observed cooperation rates and the current state of the resource. Near the end of the game, it prioritizes immediate gains.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first few rounds (e.g., 5% of total rounds), always Cooperate to encourage others to do the same and maintain a sustainable stock level.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment Based on Cooperation Rate:**
   - Track the average cooperation rate over recent history (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - If the cooperation rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%), continue Cooperating.
   - If below this threshold, switch to Defecting to prevent being exploited when trust has broken down.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final 10% of rounds, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff by defecting, as future rounds are limited and the resource's sustainability is less critical.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to signal willingness to maintain a sustainable stock.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is critically low (e.g., below 50% of capacity), switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion, even if others cooperate.
- **Endgame Adjustment:** Regardless of cooperation rates, defect in the last few rounds to capitalize on immediate gains.

### Robustness:
The strategy is adaptive and robust by adjusting based on observed cooperation rates and resource levels. It balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring adaptability against various opponent behaviors.

### Summary Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, recent_coop_rate, stock_level):
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to encourage others
    if round_number <= 0.05 * total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Track recent cooperation rate (e.g., last 5 rounds)
    recent_k = min(round_number - 1, 5)  # Adjust window size as needed
    recent_coop_rate = calculate_recent_coop_rate(recent_k)
    
    # Check if in endgame phase
    if round_number > total_rounds - 0.1 * total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    # Cooperate threshold and stock consideration
    cooperate_threshold = 0.6
    low_stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if recent_coop_rate > cooperate_threshold and stock_level >= low_stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Final Strategy Description:

**1. Initial Rounds (Cooperate Phase):**
- The strategy starts with Cooperating in the first 5% of rounds to encourage a cooperative environment among all players.

**2. Middle Rounds (Dynamic Adjustment):**
- Track the cooperation rate over recent history (last 5 rounds).
- If the majority (60%) of players Cooperate, continue doing so to sustain the resource.
- If cooperation drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting to avoid exploitation.

**3. Endgame Phase:**
- In the final 10% of rounds, prioritize defecting to maximize immediate payoff since future sustainability is less critical.

This approach ensures a balance between fostering long-term cooperation and adapting to exploit short-term opportunities when necessary, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while aiming for collective benefit.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Threshold

**Objective:**  
Maximize collective payoff while maintaining sustainable resource levels, balancing between cooperation for long-term gains and defection as a response to exploiters or critical stock levels.

---

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets the tone for potential future cooperation and avoids immediate exploitation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - If in the previous round, more than or equal to half of the players cooperated:
     - Cooperate (C).
   - Else:
     - Defect (D).

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Cooperate (C). This avoids a "Tragedy of the Commons" in the final round, ensuring sustainable stock levels for any potential future rounds (even though there are none, this aligns with collective sustainability goals).

4. **Edge Case: Stock Level Below Threshold:**
   - If current stock \( S \leq 25\% \) of capacity:
     - Defect (D). This prevents further depletion and allows the player to maximize their limited remaining payoff.

---

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(history, state):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    stock = state['stock']
    capacity = state['capacity']

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == r:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate previous round cooperation rate
        prev_cooperators = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C')
        cooperation_rate = prev_cooperators / n

        # Check if stock is critically low
        if stock <= 0.25 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            if cooperation_rate >= 0.5:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

---

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**  
   The strategy starts with cooperation to encourage others to do the same, promoting a cooperative equilibrium.

2. **Adaptive Behavior:**  
   In subsequent rounds, the strategy adapts based on the previous round's cooperation rate:
   - If most players cooperated (\( \geq 50\% \)), it continues to cooperate, reinforcing the cooperative dynamic.
   - If less than half of the players cooperated (\( < 50\% \)), it defects, signaling dissatisfaction with widespread exploitation and protecting against being exploited.

3. **Sustainability in Final Round:**  
   In the final round, cooperation ensures that the stock remains sustainable for any potential future rounds (even though none exist), maintaining a long-term collective mindset.

4. **Critical Stock Threshold:**  
   If the stock falls below \( 25\% \) of capacity, the strategy defects to maximize immediate payoff while avoiding further depletion of an already critically low resource.

---

### Alignment with Collective Mindset:

- Prioritizes long-term sustainability over short-term gains.
- Encourages mutual cooperation when possible but includes safeguards against exploitation.
- Balances individual rationality with collective responsibility.

This strategy is adaptive, robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors, and aligns with the principles of common pool resource management.

**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate unconditionally to set a cooperative baseline and encourage other players to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Check:** If the current stock is above 70% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
   - **Defection Consideration:** If the stock is below this threshold:
     - Assess the cooperation rate from recent rounds. If more than 50% of players Cooperated in the last few rounds, consider Cooperating to encourage sustainability.
     - If fewer than 50% Cooperated, switch to Defecting temporarily to maximize immediate gains and observe if others adjust their strategies.

3. **Adaptation Mechanism:**
   - Track the number of Cooperators and Defectors over recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds).
   - Use a moving average to smooth out volatility in cooperation rates.
   - Adjust the threshold dynamically based on observed trends; if stock replenishes well with high cooperation, maintain higher thresholds. If not, lower thresholds to reflect increased risk.

4. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Evaluate the current stock level:
     - If above 70% of capacity and many players have Cooperated in recent rounds, continue Cooperating to end sustainably.
     - If below this threshold or cooperation rates are low, consider Defecting to maximize immediate payoff.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, start with Cooperation to foster a cooperative environment.
   - For the last round, balance between maximizing individual gain and maintaining sustainability based on observed trends.

6. **Dynamic Thresholds:**
   - Adjust thresholds (e.g., 70%) dynamically based on stock growth rates and cooperation trends observed in previous rounds.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock, capacity, history_cooperation):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Check current stock level
        if stock > 0.7 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Calculate recent cooperation rate
            recent_rounds = min(5, len(history_cooperation))
            recent_coop_rate = sum(history_cooperation[-recent_rounds:]) / recent_rounds
            if recent_coop_rate > 0.5:
                # Encourage continued cooperation
                return 'C'
            else:
                # Switch to defecting temporarily
                return 'D'
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed behaviors and stock levels to foster collective cooperation while being resilient against defection trends.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_550 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining cooperation among players while avoiding resource collapse, we propose a strategy that dynamically adjusts based on past cooperation rates and current resource levels. The strategy aims to sustain high payoffs through cooperation while preventing mutual defection that leads to resource depletion.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to set a positive example.
2. **Dynamic Decision Making**:
   - Track recent cooperation rates over a sliding window (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - Cooperate if others have been Cooperating consistently (e.g., majority Cooperated in at least 3 out of the last 5 rounds) and the resource level is not too low.
   - Always Cooperate when the resource level is very low to encourage recovery.
   - Defect otherwise, especially if cooperation has been inconsistent or the resource is sufficiently high.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(previous_rounds_history, current_stock, n, capacity):
    # Parameters
    window_size = 5
    required_coop_in_window = 3
    threshold_low = 0.2 * capacity
    threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity

    if len(previous_rounds_history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate past cooperation in recent rounds
    recent_coops = []
    for hist in previous_rounds_history[-window_size:]:
        coop_count = sum(1 for action in hist['actions'] if action == 'C')
        majority_coop = (coop_count > n / 2)
        recent_coops.append(majority_coop)
    
    # Determine if we need to rebuild the stock
    low_stock = current_stock < threshold_low
    high_stock = current_stock > threshold_high
    
    # Count how many times in recent window majority cooperated
    coop_count_in_window = sum(recent_coops)
    
    if low_stock:
        return 'C'
    elif (coop_count_in_window >= required_coop_in_window) and not high_stock:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts with cooperation to encourage others to do the same.
- **Sliding Window of Past Behavior**: By examining recent rounds, the strategy assesses whether cooperation has been consistent. This helps maintain cooperation unless there's a significant and sustained drop in cooperation rates.
- **Stock Thresholds**: Low stock triggers cooperation to rebuild resources, while high stock allows for continued cooperation without risking immediate depletion.
- **Defection as Last Resort**: Defecting happens when cooperation is inconsistent or the resource is high enough to risk overuse. This prevents mutual exploitation and potential collapse.

This approach balances between sustaining cooperation for mutual benefit and defecting when necessary to avoid resource depletion, ensuring long-term sustainability and higher payoffs for all players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_551 = '''
The strategy is designed to balance cooperation for long-term sustainability with adaptability to exploiters. Here's the structured approach:

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative Strategy (ACS)

**Objective:** Maximize collective payoff by maintaining resource sustainability while adapting to others' behaviors.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to establish a sustainable base and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **Current Stock Check:** Evaluate if the stock is above an adaptive threshold (initially 80% of capacity).
   b. **Recent Cooperation Rate:** Assess cooperation rates from the past 5 rounds, using a weighted average for stability.
   
   c. **Action Decision:**
      - If both the stock is above the threshold and recent cooperation rate exceeds 60%, Cooperate.
      - Otherwise, Defect to prevent resource depletion or signal others.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Adjust the threshold based on past performance. Increase if Cooperating maintains the stock; decrease if it frequently drops below the threshold.

4. **Endgame Handling (Last 10% Rounds):** Prioritize short-term gains with a higher tendency to Defect, balancing immediate payoff against resource preservation.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def adaptive_cooperative_strategy(round_number, current_stock, capacity, recent_rounds_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    threshold = calculate_threshold(current_stock, capacity)
    cooperation_rate = calculate_recent_cooperation(recent_rounds_actions)
    
    if current_stock > threshold and cooperation_rate > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def calculate_threshold(current_stock, capacity):
    # Adaptive logic based on historical performance
    pass

def calculate_recent_cooperation(recent_rounds_actions):
    total_coop = sum([action == 'C' for action in recent_rounds_actions])
    return total_coop / len(recent_rounds_actions)
```

---

### **Key Considerations:**

- **Balanced Adaptation:** The strategy adapts to both resource levels and others' behaviors, ensuring sustainability without exploitation.
- **Dynamic Threshold:** Adjusts based on performance, enhancing resilience against varying conditions.
- **Endgame Adjustment:** Balances immediate gains with sustainable practices in the final rounds.

This approach encourages long-term cooperation while being pragmatic in adapting to changing dynamics.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_552 = '''
The optimal strategy to ensure the sustainability of the resource and maximize collective payoff over all rounds is to **always Cooperate**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Dynamics:**
   - Each round, players consume a portion of the shared resource.
   - Cooperating consumes less per player but offers lower immediate payoff.
   - Defecting (consuming more) increases individual payoff in the current round but risks depleting the resource faster, reducing future payoffs for everyone.

2. **Impact of Cooperation:**
   - When all players Cooperate:
     - Consumption is minimal each round.
     - The remaining resource can recover and even grow to its maximum capacity due to the growth mechanism (doubling up to the limit).
     - Ensures that the resource remains sustainable indefinitely, maximizing total payoff over all rounds.

3. **Impact of Defection:**
   - If players defect:
     - Higher immediate payoff but leads to quicker depletion of the resource.
     - Lower resource in subsequent rounds reduces both growth and potential future payoffs.
     - Risks crashing the resource below recovery thresholds, leading to long-term loss for everyone.

4. **Long-Term vs Short-Term Gains:**
   - Cooperating balances immediate gains with sustainability, ensuring steady payoffs over all rounds.
   - Defecting may boost current round payoff but risks diminishing returns and eventual collapse of the resource, harming future earnings.

5. **Collective Benefit:**
   - By always Cooperating, each player contributes to maintaining a healthy resource level.
   - This strategy avoids the tragedy of the commons, where individual self-interest leads to collective loss.

**Conclusion:**

The optimal strategy for sustainability and maximizing total payoff is to **always Cooperate**, ensuring the resource remains abundant and productive across all rounds. 

$\boxed{\text{Always Cooperate}}$

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperative Harvesting (ACH)**

The goal of ACH is to sustainably manage the common pool resource by dynamically adjusting players' actions based on current stock levels and historical trends. This strategy promotes cooperation when resources are abundant and switches to defecting when necessary to prevent overexploitation.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Rationale: Start with maximum cooperation to maintain high stock levels, allowing for optimal growth.

2. **Ongoing Stock Assessment:**
   - After each round, evaluate the current stock level and its trend relative to capacity.
   - Use predefined thresholds (e.g., 80%, 70%, and 50% of capacity) to decide between cooperation and defection.

3. **Threshold-Based Decisions:**
   - **Stock Above 80% Capacity:**
     - Continue Cooperating.
     - Rationale: High stock supports growth, so sustainable harvesting is possible.
   - **Stock Between 70-80% Capacity:**
     - Monitor trends; if stock is increasing, continue Cooperating. If decreasing, consider Defecting in the next round to signal the need for change.
   - **Stock Below 70% Capacity:**
     - Switch to Defecting to reduce consumption and allow the stock to recover.
     - Rationale: Lower stock levels require conservation; defecting reduces strain on resources.

4. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Track stock changes over recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds).
   - If stock is consistently decreasing despite cooperation, increase defection rates to prevent further decline.

5. **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**
   - After significant events (e.g., rapid stock depletion), adjust thresholds dynamically.
     - Example: Lower the threshold for defecting if the stock fails to recover as expected.

6. **Last Few Rounds (Final 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Shift towards Defecting to maximize individual payoffs, considering there are no future rounds to affect sustainability.
   - Rationale: In later rounds, focus on immediate gains without worrying about long-term resource health.

---

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Track Stock History:**
   - Maintain a record of stock levels from previous rounds to identify trends and assess the effectiveness of current strategies.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - After each round, evaluate if current thresholds are effective.
     - If the stock is not recovering as expected, lower the threshold for switching to Defecting.

3. **Signal Detection:**
   - Use past stock levels to detect when cooperation is failing to sustain resources.
   - Example: If cooperation persists but stock continues to drop, it may indicate excessive defecting by others; respond by increasing defection rates.

4. **Coordinate Without Communication:**
   - Each player independently assesses the stock and decides actions based on predefined conditions, leading to collective behavior without explicit coordination.

---

### **Pseudocode Overview**

```python
def decide_action(player_index, history, current_stock):
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate
    if round_number < 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check current stock against thresholds
    capacity = game_parameters['capacity']
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    medium_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    # Determine trend based on past 3 rounds
    recent_stock = history[-3:]
    stock_trend = calculate_trend(recent_stock)
    
    # Decision logic
    if current_stock > high_threshold and stock_trend >= 0:
        return 'C'
    elif medium_threshold <= current_stock <= high_threshold:
        if stock_trend < 0:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif current_stock < medium_threshold:
        # Check if last few actions led to recovery
        recent_actions = history[-3:]
        if is_recovery_likely(recent_actions):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # Fallback decision
    return 'C'

def calculate_trend(stock_levels):
    # Calculate if stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable
    changes = [stock_levels[i+1] - stock_levels[i] for i in range(len(stock_levels)-1)]
    trend = sum(changes)
    return trend

def is_recovery_likely(recent_actions):
    # Check if recent cooperation has led to positive trends
    cooperation_count = recent_actions.count('C')
    return cooperation_count > 2
```

---

### **Rationale**

ACH balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by adaptively switching between cooperation and defection based on resource levels. By monitoring stock trends and dynamically adjusting thresholds, players can respond to changing conditions without relying on explicit communication or coordination. This strategy promotes collective responsibility while remaining robust against various opponent behaviors.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to maximize initial growth.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Shift towards Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources.
- **Stock Collapse (Below 50% Capacity):** All players should defect to minimize further damage and allow the stock to recover in subsequent rounds.

### **Conclusion**

ACH is a robust strategy that promotes sustainable resource management by dynamically adapting to current conditions. It encourages cooperation when resources are plentiful and switches to defection when necessary to prevent overexploitation, ensuring long-term viability of the common pool resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_554 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation with necessary defection, adapting based on observed behavior and resource status. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to promote sustainability and observe others' actions.

2. **Adaptive Behavior**:
   - Track the number of Defectors from previous rounds.
   - Use thresholds for stock levels and defect rates to decide when to switch strategies.

3. **Defection Thresholds**:
   - If the current stock is below a certain level or if a significant proportion of players are Defecting, start Defecting in subsequent rounds.

4. **Last Rounds Adjustment**: In the final few rounds, consider increasing defection to maximize short-term gains since there's no future benefit from maintaining the resource.

### Detailed Strategy

1. **First Round**:
   - Cooperate (C) to encourage sustainability and gather initial data on others' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Cooperation Phase**: Continue Cooperating as long as the stock remains above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) and the number of Defectors is low.
   - **Defection Trigger**: Switch to Defecting if the stock drops below the threshold or if more than a certain percentage of players have previously Defected.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - After each round, update thresholds based on current stock levels and observed behavior.
   - If many players are Cooperating, maintain Cooperation to support resource growth.
   - If significant Defection is detected, respond by defecting to prevent exploitation and signal the need for cooperation.

4. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%), consider increasing defection to maximize individual payoffs since long-term sustainability is less critical.

### Thresholds

- **Stock Threshold**: If the stock drops below 70% of capacity, consider defecting.
- **Defection Rate**: If more than 30% of players have Defected in previous rounds, switch to defecting.

### Pseudocode Summary

```python
def decide_action(history):
    if history.round == 1:
        return C
    else:
        stock = current_stock()
        defectors = count_defectors(history)
        
        if stock < 0.7 * capacity or defectors > 0.3 * n:
            return D
        else:
            return C

def update_thresholds():
    global stock_threshold, defection_rate
    stock_history = get_allstocks()
    recent_stock = stock_history[-5:]  # last 5 rounds
    avg_stock = average(recent_stock)
    
    if avg_stock < 0.6 * capacity:
        stock_threshold = max(stock_threshold - 10, 0.5 * capacity)
    elif avg_stock > 0.8 * capacity:
        stock_threshold = min(stock_threshold + 5, capacity)

    recent_defectors = count_defectors(history.last_5_rounds())
    if recent_defectors > 2:
        defection_rate += 1
    else:
        defection_rate = max(defection_rate - 1, 0)
```

### Conclusion

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on resource status and observed behavior. It promotes sustainability while protecting against exploitation, making it robust in various scenarios.

### 集体策略设计

为了应对Common Pool Resource Game中的挑战，我们设计了一种自适应集体策略。该策略旨在通过考虑当前股票状态和历史行为来平衡合作与缺陷，从而在长期中实现资源的可持续利用。

#### 决策规则

1. **初始轮次**：
   - 在第一轮选择合作（C），以展示善意并鼓励其他玩家的合作意愿。

2. **后续轮次决策**：
   - **股票状态评估**：计算当前股票与容量的比例。设定一个动态阈值，通常为0.6倍的容量。如果当前股票高于该阈值，则继续合作；否则，考虑缺陷。
   
3. **历史行为分析**：
   - 统计过去r/2轮中其他玩家选择缺陷的比例。如果大部分玩家倾向于缺陷（如超过50%的缺陷率），则增加己方缺陷的概率，以进行报复并激励其他人的合作。

4. **报复机制**：
   - 如果在过去的三轮中有至少两位玩家选择了缺陷，则在当前轮次中选择缺陷，以惩罚他们的行为，从而促进整体的合作氛围。

#### 边缘情况处理

- **第一轮**：如前所述，选择合作。
- **接近零的股票**：如果股票水平极低（低于0.1倍容量），则所有玩家的选择都会导致高消耗，此时可能需要调整策略以避免进一步损害资源。
- **最后一轮**：在最后一轮中，可以考虑最大化个人收益，选择缺陷，因为没有未来的影响。

#### 策略实施步骤

1. **初始化**：
   - 在第一轮中，所有玩家都选择合作（C）。

2. **每一轮操作**：
   a. 检查当前股票水平与容量的比例。
   b. 如果股票高于0.6倍容量，则继续选择合作；否则考虑缺陷。
   c. 分析过去r/2轮中的其他玩家行为，统计缺陷比例。
   d. 如果有超过50%的玩家在过去倾向于缺陷，则增加己方的缺陷概率。
   e. 检查过去三轮中是否有至少两位玩家选择缺陷。如果是，则当前轮次选择缺陷以进行报复。

3. **动态调整**：
   - 根据每一轮的结果，动态调整阈值和报复机制，以适应其他玩家行为的变化。

#### 策略优势

- 通过合作维持资源的可持续性。
- 利用历史行为分析和报复机制激励其他玩家的合作。
- 动态调整策略以应对不同的对手行为模式。

这种策略在保持合作的同时，能够有效地应对缺陷行为，从而实现集体利益的最大化。

**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Phase (First 20% of Rounds):**
   - Cooperate in the first few rounds to encourage others to do the same, helping maintain a stable stock level.

2. **Monitoring Stock Levels:**
   - Track the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If the stock remains above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating as it indicates sustainable behavior among players.

3. **Detecting Defection:**
   - If the stock starts dropping significantly despite your own Cooperations, infer that others are defecting.
   - Switch to defecting in subsequent rounds to maximize immediate payoff and prevent being exploited.

4. **Adaptive Switching:**
   - Periodically (e.g., every 5 rounds), test Cooperating even after switching to Defect.
   - If testing leads to a stable or increasing stock, revert to Cooperating as it suggests others have started Cooperating again.

5. **Endgame Strategy (Last 20% of Rounds):**
   - Defect in the final few rounds to maximize personal payoff since there's no future benefit from sustaining the resource.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a positive example.
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize immediate gain.
   - **Critically Low Stock:** Defect to grab as much as possible before depletion.
   - **Stable High Stock:** Continue Cooperating to maintain resource sustainability.

This strategy balances promoting sustainability with adapting to exploit when necessary, using observable system states (stock levels) as indicators of collective behavior. It is robust and scalable across different game parameters without relying on explicit coordination mechanisms.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_557 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining cooperation in a repeated resource management game, we propose a strategy that balances long-term sustainability with short-term payoff considerations. The strategy incorporates dynamic decision-making based on smoothed stock levels and prepares for the final rounds by defecting to maximize immediate gains.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Set an initial smoothed stock level equal to the resource's capacity.
   - Choose a smoothing factor (α) to weigh recent stock levels more heavily than older ones.
   - Define a threshold, typically set at 80% of capacity, to determine cooperation.

2. **Dynamic Cooperation Decision:**
   - For each round except the last few, update the smoothed stock level using exponential smoothing:
     \[
     \text{smoothed\_stock}[t] = \alpha \times \text{current\_stock} + (1 - \alpha) \times \text{smoothed\_stock}[t-1]
     \]
   - If the smoothed stock is above the threshold, Cooperate to sustain the resource.
   - If it's below, Defect to either signal others or maximize personal gain.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final few rounds (e.g., last 2 rounds), switch to always Defecting to exploit remaining resources for immediate payoff.

4. **Adaptation and Robustness:**
   - The strategy adapts dynamically by smoothing stock levels, reducing volatility in decisions.
   - Prepares for potential collapse in later rounds while encouraging cooperation when sustainable.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, smoothed_stock_prev, alpha, threshold, total_rounds, current_round, k_endgame):
    # Update the smoothed stock using exponential smoothing
    smoothed_stock = alpha * current_stock + (1 - alpha) * smoothed_stock_prev
    
    # Check if it's in the last few rounds for endgame strategy
    if current_round >= (total_rounds - k_endgame):
        return "Defect"
    
    # Decide based on smoothed stock and threshold
    if smoothed_stock > threshold:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"

# Example usage:
alpha = 0.5  # Smoothing factor
threshold = 0.8 * capacity  # 80% of capacity as the cooperation threshold
k_endgame = 2  # Last two rounds to defect

smoothed_stock = capacity  # Initialize with full capacity

for current_round in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    action = decide_action(current_stock, smoothed_stock, alpha, threshold, total_rounds, current_round, k_endgame)
    print(f"Round {current_round}: Action is {action}")
    smoothed_stock = update_smoothed_stock(current_stock, smoothed_stock, alpha)
```

**Answer:**

To implement the strategy effectively:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set `smoothed_stock` to the initial capacity of the resource.
   - Define a smoothing factor (e.g., α = 0.5) and a cooperation threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity).

2. **Dynamic Decision-Making:**
   - For each round, update the smoothed stock level using the current stock and previous smoothed value.
   - Cooperate if the smoothed stock exceeds the threshold; otherwise, Defect.

3. **Endgame Preparation:**
   - In the final few rounds (e.g., last 2), switch to always Defecting to exploit remaining resources.

**Final Strategy in Pseudocode:**

```python
alpha = 0.5
threshold = 0.8 * capacity
k_endgame = 2

smoothed_stock = capacity

for current_round in 1..total_rounds:
    if current_round > (total_rounds - k_endgame):
        action = "Defect"
    else:
        smoothed_stock = alpha * current_stock + (1 - alpha) * smoothed_stock
        action = "Cooperate" if smoothed_stock > threshold else "Defect"
    print(f"Action in round {current_round}: {action}")
```

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when the smoothed stock exceeds 80% of capacity; defect otherwise, especially in the final two rounds.}}

description_COLLECTIVE_558 = '''
To address the challenge of sustainably managing a shared resource while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a dynamic cooperation-defection strategy. This approach balances the need for long-term resource health with immediate gain optimization.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating to maintain high stock levels, allowing for maximum regrowth and consistent payoffs.
2. **Monitor Trends**: Track the current_stock level and its trend over recent rounds to assess sustainability.
3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**:
   - **Lower Threshold on Decline**: If the stock shows a significant downward trend, decrease the threshold to encourage more Defection, preventing further depletion.
   - **Raise Threshold on Recovery**: When the stock stabilizes or increases, raise the threshold to promote continued Cooperating, fostering sustainability.
4. **Decision Making Each Round**:
   - **Cooperate if Stock is High Enough**: If current_stock ≥ adjusted_threshold, choose to Cooperate.
   - **Defect Otherwise**: If current_stock < adjusted_threshold, switch to Defecting to maximize individual gain.
5. **Continuous Adaptation**: Adjust the threshold dynamically based on stock trends to balance sustainability and payoffs effectively.

**Final Answer:**

Adopt a dynamic strategy where you Cooperate when the current resource level is above a dynamically adjusted threshold and Defect otherwise. This approach ensures sustainable management while maximizing individual payoffs:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current_stock ≥ dynamic_threshold; else, Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_559 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy as an AI player in a scenario where players can either Cooperate or Defect, we follow these steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to promote sustainable resource use and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Monitor Consumption**: After each round, calculate the actual consumption and compare it to the expected consumption if all players had Cooperated (expected_C_consumption = S_prev / 2).

3. **Identify Overconsumption**: Compute overconsumption as the difference between actual consumption and expected_C_consumption. Accumulate this over time.

4. **Threshold Check**: Once cumulative overconsumption exceeds a predetermined threshold (e.g., 10% of the resource capacity), switch to Defecting for all remaining rounds. This response is based on evidence that others are exploiting the resource, making continued cooperation unsustainable.

5. **Defection Phase**: From the point of switching, defect in all subsequent rounds to maximize individual payoff given the observed exploitation by other players.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Start with Cooperation**: The first move is Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and test others' behavior.

2. **Calculate Expected Consumption**: If all players Cooperated, total consumption would be half of the resource stock (S_prev / 2).

3. **Determine Actual Consumption**: Subtract the stock after consumption from the previous round's stock to find actual_consumption.

4. **Compute Overconsumption**: Subtract expected_C_consumption from actual_consumption to measure how much over the sustainable limit the consumption was.

5. **Track Cumulative Overconsumption**: Keep a running total of overconsumption across rounds to detect if exploitation is significant enough to warrant defecting.

6. **Switch Strategy on Threshold**: When cumulative overconsumption surpasses the threshold (e.g., 0.1 * capacity), switch from Cooperating to Defecting permanently. This decision reflects that cooperation is no longer viable due to others' exploitation, and defecting maximizes individual payoff under these conditions.

By following this strategy, the AI balances between promoting sustainability and protecting its interests when faced with exploiters.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_560 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy, we'll use a combination of current stock levels and recent player behavior to decide whether to cooperate or defect.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Assess Current Stock Level:**
   - Calculate the ratio of the current stock to its maximum capacity (`S_ratio = current_stock / capacity`).
   - If `S_ratio < T1`, where `T1` is a threshold (e.g., 0.4 or 40%), defect to prevent further depletion.

2. **Evaluate Recent Player Behavior:**
   - Count the number of defects by other players over the last `m` rounds (`total_defects`).
   - Calculate the defect rate relative to possible actions (`defect_rate = total_defects / (m * (n_players - 1))`), where `n_players` is the number of players excluding yourself.
   - If `defect_rate > T2`, where `T2` is a threshold (e.g., 0.3 or 30%), defect to avoid exploitation.

3. **Make Decision:**
   - Defect if either condition above is met; otherwise, cooperate.

**Final Strategy:**

In each round:
1. Calculate the stock ratio and defect rate based on recent behavior.
2. Cooperate unless the stock is critically low (`S_ratio < 0.4`) or other players have been defecting frequently (`defect_rate > 0.3`).

This strategy balances resource sustainability with reciprocity, ensuring cooperation when beneficial and defection when necessary to protect one's interests.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate unless the stock is below 40% of capacity or more than 30% of other players have defected in recent rounds}}$

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock Threshold and Historical Defection**

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on the current stock level and historical player behavior. The strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Decision Rules

1. **Threshold Calculation**: Set a dynamic threshold at half of the capacity (threshold = capacity / 2). This serves as a guide for when cooperation or defection is more appropriate.

2. **Current Stock Check**:
   - If the current stock (S) is below the threshold, cooperate to allow regrowth and prevent depletion.
   - If S is above the threshold, evaluate past behavior to decide whether to defect or cooperate.

3. **Past Behavior Analysis**: Look at previous rounds where the stock was above the threshold. Calculate the proportion of defections by other players in those rounds. This helps determine if others have a history of exploiting the resource when it's abundant.

4. **Decision Based on Past Defections**:
   - If the defect rate exceeds 30%, cooperate to prevent future depletion and encourage sustainability.
   - If the defect rate is low (≤30%), defect to maximize immediate payoff, as others are likely cooperating.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to set a cooperative precedent and avoid potential over-depletion if others also defect.
   - **Last Round (r)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds for retaliation or depletion effects.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```pseudocode
for each player:
    threshold = capacity / 2
    if current_round == r:
        action = D  # Last round, defect to maximize payoff
    else:
        if S < threshold:
            action = C  # Cooperate to allow stock recovery
        else:
            count_defects_past = number of observed defections in previous rounds where S >= threshold
            total_possible = (number of such rounds) * (n - 1)  # Excluding self
            if total_possible == 0:
                defect_rate = 0
            else:
                defect_rate = count_defects_past / total_possible
            if defect_rate > 0.3:  # If more than 30% have defected when safe
                action = C  # Cooperate to prevent future depletion
            else:
                action = D  # Defect, as others are likely cooperating
    return action
```

### Explanation

- **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold is set at half the capacity to ensure sustainable exploitation. Below this level, cooperation is necessary to allow resource recovery.
  
- **Current Stock Check**: By monitoring the stock, players can decide whether immediate exploitation (defection) or preservation (cooperation) is more beneficial.

- **Past Behavior Analysis**: Observing past defections helps predict future behavior. A high defect rate indicates a risk of over-exploitation, prompting cooperation to maintain sustainability.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - In the first round, cooperation sets a cooperative tone, encouraging others to follow suit and avoid immediate depletion.
  - In the last round, defecting is optimal as there are no future rounds for repercussions or further resource exploitation.

This strategy effectively balances between maximizing immediate gains and ensuring long-term sustainability by adapting based on current conditions and historical player behavior.

description_COLLECTIVE_562 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to signal a willingness to share resources and encourage others to Cooperate.

2. **Monitoring Opponent Behavior**: Track the number of Cooperators among opponents over recent rounds (e.g., the last 3-5 rounds). This helps determine whether others are Cooperating or Defecting.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - If more than 70% of players Cooperated in recent rounds, continue Cooperating to sustain the resource and maximize long-term gains.
   - If fewer than 70% of players Cooperated, switch to Defecting to either punish Defectors or maximize personal gain before potential collapse.

4. **Stock Level Adjustment**: Monitor the current stock level. If it drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), increase the tendency to Defect to exploit remaining resources before potential depletion.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage others to follow suit.
   - **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

6. **Occasional Cooperation Attempts**: Periodically Cooperate even when others are defecting, to attempt to restart cooperation and potentially lead to more sustainable resource use.

This strategy balances maintaining cooperation for long-term sustainability with adapting to exploit or punish defection when necessary, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_563 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to begin sustainably and preserve the common pool.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Above 75% of Capacity**:
     - Monitor opponents' actions.
     - If a majority defect, consider defecting to gain immediate payoff, recognizing potential future risks.
     - If few defect, cooperate to maintain stock stability and encourage sustainable gains.
   - **Stock Below 75%**:
     - Always Cooperate to prevent further depletion and support regrowth.

3. **Adaptation Mechanism**: Adjust strategy based on opponents' past actions. Increased defecting by others may prompt more cooperative behavior to reset the system.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round**: Consider defecting for maximum immediate payoff.
   - **Stock Near Capacity**: Cooperate to sustain future rounds.

5. **Implementation Notes**:
   - Use a simple threshold (75%) as an indicator for switching between cooperation and defection.
   - Track opponents' actions over time to inform decisions, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term resource preservation, adapting to opponents' behaviors while maintaining robustness across various game dynamics.

To design a robust strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we must balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy should adapt based on observable state changes, without relying on specific coordination with others.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating to encourage sustainable resource use and set a positive trend.
2. **Monitor Stock Trends**: Track stock levels relative to capacity. If the actual stock significantly deviates from expected levels (assuming everyone Cooperates), infer that Defectors are present.
3. **Adaptive Defection**: If the stock falls below a certain threshold, start defecting more aggressively to protect against exploitation.
4. **Late-Round Adjustment**: Near the end of the game, switch to defecting if it increases immediate payoff, as future rounds are limited.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate to build trust and maintain stock sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the expected stock level if all players had Cooperated in previous rounds.
   - Compare this with the actual stock history. If the actual stock is significantly lower, infer Defection and consider defecting.
3. **Stock Thresholds**: Use a predefined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity). If the stock drops below this, increase defection frequency to prevent further depletion.
4. **Late Rounds**: In the final few rounds, switch to always Defecting if it yields higher payoffs, as there's no future impact to consider.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock_history, round_number, capacity, n, r):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        expected_stock = calculate_expected_coop_stock(stock_history)
        actual_stock = stock_history[-1]
        
        # Calculate threshold for cooperation
        threshold = 0.75 * capacity
        
        if actual_stock < threshold:
            # Check if we've seen consistent decreases
            if is_consistently_decreasing(stock_history):
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        else:
            # If near the end, defect to maximize payoff
            if round_number > r - 2:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'

def calculate_expected_coop_stock(history):
    # Simulate stock assuming all Cooperate each round
    expected = history[0]
    for s in history[1:]:
        consumption = n * (expected / (2*n))  # Each Cooperate consumes expected/(2n)
        remaining = expected - consumption
        growth = 2 * remaining * (1 - remaining / capacity)
        expected = min(remaining + growth, capacity)
    return expected

def is_consistently_decreasing(history):
    # Check if stock has been decreasing for multiple rounds
    decrease_count = 0
    for i in range(1, len(history)):
        if history[i] < history[i-1]:
            decrease_count += 1
        else:
            break
    return decrease_count > 2  # Arbitrary threshold for consistency
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts by Cooperating to maintain a healthy stock level.
- **Stock Monitoring**: Tracks whether the actual stock deviates from expected levels, indicating potential Defectors.
- **Threshold-Based Defection**: Switches to defecting if the stock drops below 75% of capacity, balancing immediate gains with sustainability concerns.
- **Late-Round Adjustment**: Maximizes payoffs in the final rounds by defecting, as future consequences are minimal.

This strategy adapts dynamically, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors while promoting a collective mindset focused on sustainability and fairness.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_565 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative Strategy (ACS)

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff by balancing cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection to avoid exploitation.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Establish trust and encourage others to cooperate, maintaining a healthy stock level for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the **Cooperation Ratio** of other players in the previous round(s).
   - Compute the **Stock Health Index (SHI)** based on current stock levels.
   - Determine whether to Cooperate or Defect using a weighted decision matrix.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment Based on SHI and Cooperation Ratio:**
   - If SHI is above 75% and the Cooperation Ratio is high (>60%), continue Cooperating.
   - If SHI drops below 75%, increase readiness to Defect, especially if Cooperation Ratio decreases.
   - Apply a Tit-for-Tat approach with forgiveness: respond to recent defections but allow re-engagement in cooperation if conditions improve.

4. **Endgame (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - If stock is healthy, continue Cooperating to sustain it for potential future rounds beyond the tournament.
   - If stock is low or at risk, consider Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs before the game ends.

---

### **Cooperation Ratio Calculation:**

- Use a weighted average of cooperation rates from the past 3 rounds, giving more weight to recent behavior (e.g., weights [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]).

---

### **Stock Health Index (SHI):**

- SHI = [(Current Stock + Growth Potential) / Capacity] * 100
- If SHI > 75%, stock is considered healthy.
- Below 75%, it's at risk and may require more cautious behavior.

---

### **Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, n, capacity, stock, history):
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate Cooperation Ratio (CR)
    recent_rounds = history[-3:]
    total_cooperate = sum(1 for r in recent_rounds for a in r['actions'] if a == 'C')
    cr = total_cooperate / (n * len(recent_rounds))
    
    # Compute Stock Health Index (SHI)
    shi = ((stock + 2 * stock * (1 - stock/capacity)) / capacity) * 100
    
    # Decision Matrix
    if shi > 75 and cr > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage in a tournament
for round in range(r):
    actions = [player.strategy(round, n, capacity, stock, history) for player in players]
    # Update state based on actions
```

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a positive tone and maintain high initial stock.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Adjust based on SHI; cooperate if healthy, defect if at risk.
- **Extreme Stock Levels:** If stock is near capacity, cooperation is key. If near zero, focus on maximizing immediate gains.

---

**Conclusion:**

The Adaptive Cooperative Strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on others' behavior and stock health. It aims to maximize total payoff while encouraging cooperative outcomes when possible.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It starts with cooperation to preserve resources and adapts based on stock levels and opponents' actions. Here's a structured overview:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to maintain a high stock level, setting a foundation for sustainable play.

2. **Adaptive Behavior**:
   - **High Stock (Above 75% Capacity)**: Defect if others are defecting moderately, but continue cooperation if many are still cooperating to avoid rapid depletion.
   - **Moderate Stock (Between 50-75%)**: Cooperate more frequently, especially if opponents' defection is high, to prevent stock collapse.

3. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - **High Threshold (Above 75% Capacity)**: Defect cautiously if others are defecting moderately.
   - **Moderate Threshold (Between 50-75%)**: Cooperate to sustain the resource.
   - **Low Threshold (Below 50%)**: Strictly cooperate to prevent collapse.

4. **Opponent Monitoring**: Track defection rates from previous rounds. If a high number of players are defecting, increase cooperation to encourage collective sustainability.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
   - **Last Round**: Treat similarly to others unless nearing low stock levels.

### Decision Rules

- **Cooperate** when:
  - Stock is below 75% of capacity and opponents are defecting moderately.
  - Stock is between 50-75% and many opponents are defecting.
  - In the last round, if stock is low.

- **Defect** when:
  - Stock is above 75% and opponents are cooperating or defecting moderately.
  - Opponents are not defecting excessively, allowing for cautious defection without causing rapid depletion.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decision(current_stock, capacity, n, prev_actions):
    threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold_med = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    opponent_defections = sum(prev_actions[-1])
    avg_defect_rate = opponent_defections / (n-1)
    
    if current_stock > threshold_high:
        if avg_defect_rate < 0.3:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif threshold_med <= current_stock <= threshold_high:
        if avg_defect_rate > 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # current_stock < threshold_med
        return 'C'

# Example usage in each round
for round in rounds:
    action = decision(stock, capacity, n, prev_actions)
    play(action)
```

### Conclusion

This strategy aims to maximize collective benefit by balancing individual gains with resource sustainability. It adapts dynamically based on stock levels and opponents' behavior, promoting cooperation when necessary and defecting cautiously to avoid exploitation while maintaining long-term resource health.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_567 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource level while allowing for some defection, the following strategy is proposed:

### Strategy:

1. **Fixed Thresholds:**
   - If the current stock is at or above 75% of capacity, all players Cooperate (C).
   - If the current stock is at or below 25% of capacity, all players Cooperate (C).

2. **Variable Threshold in Intermediate Range:**
   - For stock levels between 26% and 74%:
     a. Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round.
     b. If this proportion is at least 40%, all players Cooperate (C).
     c. Otherwise, all players Defect (D).

### Explanation:

- **Fixed Thresholds:** These ensure that when resources are abundant (75% or higher), cooperation is maintained to allow for optimal growth. Conversely, when resources are scarce (25% or lower), cooperation prevents further depletion and potential collapse.

- **Variable Threshold:** In the intermediate range, the strategy relies on the previous round's cooperation level. If a significant portion of players Cooperated (40% or more), others follow suit to maintain resource levels. This balance helps prevent rapid spirals into widespread defection while allowing for some flexibility.

### Example Application:

- **Initial Round:** All players Cooperate, maintaining high stock levels.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If resources remain high (>75%), cooperation continues.
  - In the intermediate range (26%-74%), if at least 40% of players Cooperated last round, others follow to sustain resources. Otherwise, Defectors may emerge but are limited by the threshold to prevent excessive depletion.

### Conclusion:

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains and long-term sustainability by using a combination of fixed and variable thresholds. It promotes cooperation when necessary while allowing moderate defection without risking resource collapse.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Cooperation Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Strategy (First Round):**
   - Cooperate to encourage a cooperative environment and set a positive tone.

2. **Monitoring Mechanisms:**
   - Track the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - Assess the trend of stock changes over the last few rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds) using a moving average or weighted analysis to determine if the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - Current stock is above 70% of capacity.
     - Stock trend shows stability or an upward trajectory.
   - **Defect** if:
     - Current stock drops below 70% of capacity.
     - Stock trend indicates a significant decline, suggesting excessive consumption.

4. **Adaptation to Opponents' Behavior:**
   - If a high number of players defect in previous rounds, increase defection frequency to maximize immediate gains and respond to the trend of resource depletion.

5. **Endgame Strategy (Last Few Rounds):**
   - Switch to Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future rounds.

6. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Use a weighted moving average to prioritize recent stock trends, allowing quicker adaptation to changes.
   - Adjust the threshold dynamically based on game parameters and observed player behavior patterns.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with immediate payoff maximization, adapting to both cooperative and defective environments while considering endgame scenarios.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round(s), choose to Cooperate (C) to promote sustainable use of the resource and build trust among players.

2. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - After each round, assess the remaining stock (S_remaining). If S_remaining falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), switch to Defecting (D) in subsequent rounds to prevent further depletion.

3. **Defection Threshold and Adaptation:**
   - Track the proportion of Cooperators and Defectors over recent rounds. If a majority are defecting, switch to Defecting as well to avoid being exploited.
   - Maintain a conservative approach by not switching strategies until S_remaining consistently remains low over several rounds.

4. **Recovery Phase:**
   - If the stock begins to recover (e.g., exceeds 75% of capacity), revert to Cooperating to sustain the resource and encourage others to do the same.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to promote sustainable use.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20%):** Consider defecting more frequently, balancing immediate gains against maintaining enough stock for remaining rounds.

6. **Growth Potential:**
   - Recognize that even after a dip in stock levels, recovery is possible if players switch back to Cooperating, leveraging the quadratic growth function.

This strategy balances cooperation with adaptability, using the stock level as an indicator and historical trends to decide actions, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_570 = '''
**Final Answer**

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to promote cooperation while adaptively responding to defectors to maintain a sustainable resource level. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Round Strategy:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reasoning: Sets a cooperative baseline and preserves the stock for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Strategy:**
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If in the previous round, more than 70% of players Cooperated:
       - Action: Cooperate (C)
         - Reasoning: Encourages continued cooperation to maintain a healthy stock.
     - If fewer than 70% Cooperated:
       - Action: Defect (D)
         - Reasoning: Prevents over-depletion by reducing the impact of potential defectors.

3. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reasoning: Preserves stock to ensure maximum possible payoff in the final rounds, despite the temptation to defect.

4. **Adaptive Measures:**
   - Monitor historical cooperation rates to adjust behaviors dynamically.
   - Avoid targeting specific players; instead, focus on collective trends.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **First Round:**
   - All players Cooperate (C).

2. **Rounds 2 to r-10%:**
   - Each player checks the cooperation rate in the previous round.
   - If cooperation rate ≥70%, Cooperate; else, Defect.

3. **Final 10% Rounds:**
   - All players Cooperate (C) regardless of past behavior to maximize final payoffs.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, fostering a cooperative environment while adaptively responding to potential defectors.

To determine the optimal strategy for maintaining and utilizing a shared resource, we need to balance between cooperation (to preserve the resource) and defection (to maximize immediate gain). The key steps involve analyzing different scenarios and setting thresholds based on the current stock level relative to capacity.

1. **Cooperation Analysis**:
   - When all players cooperate, the resource remains sustainable.
   - Example: If the stock is at capacity, cooperation keeps it stable.

2. **Defection Analysis**:
   - Defection can lead to immediate gain but risks depleting the resource.
   - Example: If others defect, causing a drop in stock, you defect next round.

3. **Threshold Setting**:
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above 75% of capacity.
   - Defect otherwise (if the stock is below 25% of capacity or trending downward).

4. **Final Decision Rule**:
   - Cooperate if the current stock level \( S \) is greater than or equal to 0.75 times the capacity.
   - Defect otherwise.

This rule ensures that players cooperate when the resource is abundant and defect when it is depleted, balancing between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

\[
\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the current stock is above } 75\% \text{ of capacity; otherwise, defect.}}
\]
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_572 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a dynamic strategy where each player independently adapts their decision based on observed cooperation rates among all players and the current state of the resource (stock level). The strategy incorporates adaptive thresholds for cooperation, taking into account recent trends in stock levels and the progression of the game towards its conclusion.

### Approach

1. **Dynamic Cooperation Threshold**: Each player maintains a target cooperation rate. If the observed cooperation rate in recent rounds meets or exceeds this threshold, they Cooperate; otherwise, they Defect.
2. **Stock Level Consideration**: Players adjust their cooperation threshold based on the current stock level and its trend over time. If the stock is healthy (above a certain threshold), players are more inclined to Cooperate. If the stock is struggling (below the threshold), they require a higher cooperation rate to justify Cooperating.
3. **Adaptive Decay Towards Endgame**: As the game progresses towards its conclusion, the threshold for defecting becomes more lenient. This reflects the diminishing impact of cooperation on future rounds as the end approaches.

```

### Explanation

- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: The cooperation threshold decreases linearly as the game progresses, encouraging players to Defect more towards the end when future rounds are less impacted.
- **Stock Trend Analysis**: By analyzing the trend of the stock over recent rounds, players adjust their thresholds dynamically. If the stock is decreasing, players become more inclined to Defect to avoid contributing to further depletion.
- **Cooperation Rate Check**: Players observe the cooperation rates in recent rounds. If a sufficient majority Cooperated, they are more likely to continue Cooperating; otherwise, they switch to Defecting to prevent being exploited.

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by encouraging Cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to avoid exploitation.

The AI strategy for deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is based on the current stock level relative to capacity, trends in stock levels over recent rounds, and the number of remaining rounds. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate to support sustainable use and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - Monitor current stock \( S \) relative to capacity.
   - If \( S \) is above a high threshold (e.g., 70%), Cooperate.
   - If \( S \) is below a low threshold (e.g., 30%), Defect.
   - Between thresholds, base decision on the trend of \( S \):
     - If increasing: Cooperate
     - If decreasing: Defect
     - If stable: Cooperate
3. **Final Rounds**: Always Defect to maximize immediate gains.

This strategy balances cooperation for sustainability with defection when necessary to protect against exploitation and ensure maximum payoff in later stages.

### Final Answer

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_574 = '''
To design a robust collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance cooperation with strategic defection to prevent resource depletion while ensuring sustainability. The strategy must adapt based on observed cooperation rates and current stock levels.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same.

2. **Monitor Recent Behavior:**
   - Track the cooperation rate in recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - If the cooperation rate is above a certain threshold, continue Cooperating.
   - If cooperation is low, consider Defecting to incentivize others to Cooperate.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - If the stock is below a critical threshold, prioritize Cooperating to allow replenishment.
   - When the stock is high, allow some strategic Defection without risking depletion.

4. **Defection as Punishment:**
   - Introduce a cooldown period after switching from C to D to prevent cycles of defection.
   - Revert to Cooperate if cooperation rates improve during the cooldown.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate.
   - In the last few rounds, prioritize Cooperating to maintain higher payoffs and avoid sudden stock collapse.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Cooperation Thresholds:**
   - Set an initial cooperation threshold (e.g., 60%) based on recent rounds' data.
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on current stock levels.

2. **Stock-Based Adjustments:**
   - Lower the cooperation threshold when the stock is high, allowing more flexibility.
   - Increase the threshold when the stock is low to promote replenishment.

3. **Defection Mechanism:**
   - Defect for a limited number of rounds if cooperation rates fall below the threshold.
   - After defecting, monitor cooperation rates and revert to Cooperate if others start Cooperating again.

4. **Cooldown Period:**
   - Enforce a cooldown period after switching to D to prevent oscillation between C and D.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(history, state):
    # Parameters
    recent_rounds = 5
    cooperation_threshold = 0.6
    stock_low_threshold = state.capacity * 0.3
    defect_cooldown = 2

    if not history:  # First round
        return 'C'
    
    # Get recent actions and calculate cooperation rate
    recent_actions = get_recent_actions(history, recent_rounds)
    total_players = len(history[0]['actions'])
    cooperation_count = sum(action == 'C' for action in recent_actions.values())
    cooperation_rate = cooperation_count / (total_players * recent_rounds)

    # Check current stock level
    if state.stock < stock_low_threshold:
        return 'C'
    
    # Determine action based on cooperation rate and history
    if cooperation_rate > cooperation_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        last_defect = get_last_defect_round(history)
        if (current_round - last_defect) < defect_cooldown:
            return 'D'
        else:
            recent_defectors = count_defectors(recent_actions, total_players)
            if recent_defectors > 0.7 * total_players:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by Cooperating to foster a collaborative environment.
- **Recent Behavior Monitoring:** Uses the last few rounds' actions to gauge cooperation levels and decide whether to Cooperate or Defect.
- **Stock Consideration:** Adjusts strategies based on the current stock level, prioritizing replenishment when necessary.
- **Defection as Punishment:** Temporarily defects to incentivize others but includes a cooldown to prevent cycles of defection.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** Manages first and last rounds with specific rules to maintain stability and avoid sudden collapses.

This strategy aims to sustain the resource by balancing cooperation with necessary punishment, ensuring long-term benefits for all players.

description_COLLECTIVE_575 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initialization**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage sustainability.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: For each subsequent round:
   - Observe the current stock level (S).
   - Calculate a dynamic threshold (T) based on historical trends, such as the average of the past m rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - If S is above T, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

3. **Late Round Adjustment**: In the final few rounds (e.g., last 3), switch to always Defecting to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future sustainability.

4. **Threshold Setting**: Set T at around 80% of capacity to balance cooperation when resources are healthy and defect only under stress, preventing over-exploitation.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def strategy(round_number, stock_history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    # Calculate dynamic threshold based on past m rounds (e.g., last 5)
    m = min(len(stock_history), 5)
    recent_stocks = stock_history[-m:]
    avg_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
    capacity = initial_capacity  # Known from game parameters
    threshold = 0.8 * capacity

    if round_number > (total_rounds - late_rounds):
        return 'D'  # Defect in the last few rounds

    if avg_stock >= threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy adaptively balances individual gain and resource sustainability by monitoring stock trends, adjusting behavior dynamically, and handling edge cases effectively.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Rationale: Start by cooperating to maintain a high stock level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:**
     - If current stock is above 75% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
         - Rationale: Maintain sustainable resource levels for long-term gains.
     - If current stock is between 25% and 75% of capacity:
       - **Opponent Behavior Check:**
         - If more than half of opponents defected in the previous round:
           - **Action:** Defect
             - Rationale: Prevent being exploited by defecting when others are not cooperating.
         - Else:
           - **Action:** Cooperate
             - Rationale: Continue contributing to sustainability if others are still cooperating.
     - If current stock is below 25% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect
         - Rationale: Salvage as much payoff as possible before the resource depletes.

3. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff as there's no future round to benefit from cooperation.

**Rationale for Strategy:**

- The strategy balances between maintaining resource sustainability and adapting to opponents' behavior. By using a stock threshold, it ensures that cooperation continues when the resource is healthy, promoting long-term benefits. However, if the resource is endangered or if others defect, the strategy shifts to defecting to prevent exploitation and maximize payoffs.

This approach is designed to be robust in tournaments with unpredictable opponents, ensuring a balance between collective good and individual payoff optimization.

description_COLLECTIVE_577 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection based on the game's state, history, and future considerations. Here's the structured approach:

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establishes a cooperative environment to maintain stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Thresholds:**
     - **High Stock (>90% of Capacity):** Cooperate (C). Encourages sustainable use.
     - **Medium Stock (50% < Stock ≤90%):** 
       - If majority of players cooperated in the last round, continue with C.
       - Else, switch to Defect (D) to counteract over-depletion.
     - **Low Stock (≤50% Capacity):** Defect (D). Protects against rapid depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Adaptation and History Consideration

- **Past Behavior Analysis:** Monitor the number of cooperators in recent rounds. If cooperation is prevalent, continue C; if defection increases, switch to D.
- **Stock Dynamics:** Adjust decisions based on stock level changes post-consumption and growth. Use thresholds to trigger strategic shifts.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **Exact Thresholds:** At 90% or 50%, decide based on recent cooperation rates.
- **Unexpected Stock Behavior:** If stock unexpectedly drops below thresholds, switch to D immediately.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
current_round = t
stock = current_stock_level
n_players = n
capacity = game_capacity

if current_round == 1:
    return 'C'
elif current_round < r:
    if stock > 0.9 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    elif 0.5 * capacity < stock <= 0.9 * capacity:
        # Check past cooperation rate
        recent_cooperation = sum(last_actions) / n_players
        if recent_cooperation >= 0.6:  # Arbitrary threshold for majority
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        return 'D'
else:  # Last round (current_round == r)
    return 'D'
```

### Rationale

This strategy begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource environment. It adaptively switches between cooperation and defection based on observed player behavior and current stock levels, aiming to maximize collective benefits while defending against exploiters. The last-round defection ensures players capitalize on the final opportunity without considering future impacts.

**Final Answer:**

The strategy is designed to encourage cooperation when beneficial and defect when necessary to adapt to opponents' behaviors. It uses thresholds based on stock levels and historical actions to decide each round's move, ensuring robustness across various scenarios.

```markdown
### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1):**
   - If stock > 90% capacity: Cooperate.
   - If 50% < stock ≤90% capacity: Cooperate if majority recent actions were cooperation; else Defect.
   - If stock ≤50% capacity: Defect.
3. **Last Round (r):** Defect.

### Edge Cases:
- Handle first and last rounds with fixed strategies.
- Use past cooperation rates to decide when transitioning between C and D in medium stock conditions.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to maintain or increase payoffs while preventing resource depletion.
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_578 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual gain with collective sustainability in a resource management scenario, we propose a strategic approach based on observed conditions and past actions. The strategy aims to prevent resource collapse while allowing for some defecting when it's safe.

**Final Decision Rule:**

1. **When the current stock (S) is above 75% of capacity:**
   - If the proportion of defectors in the previous round is less than 30%, choose to Defect (D). This allows for individual gain without risking over-depletion.
   - Otherwise, choose Cooperate (C) to avoid contributing to excessive resource depletion.

2. **When the current stock (S) is between 25% and 75% of capacity:**
   - Always Choose Cooperate (C). This helps maintain the resource level and prevents it from dropping too low.

3. **When the current stock (S) is below 25% of capacity:**
   - Always Choose Cooperate (C). This focuses on rebuilding the resource to a sustainable level.

This strategy uses observable data about past actions to inform decisions, aiming to prevent synchronized defection that could lead to collapse while still allowing for some defecting when conditions are favorable.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on the current stock level and past behaviors of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1)**:
   - Always Cooperate to maintain the maximum sustainable stock level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Decision Making**: Cooperate if the current stock is above an adaptive threshold; otherwise, Defect.
   - **Threshold Adjustment**: The threshold starts at 80% of capacity but adjusts based on past cooperation rates. If most players have been Cooperating, maintain a higher threshold. If many have Defected, lower the threshold to prioritize immediate gains.

3. **Last Few Rounds**:
   - Switch to Defecting in the last 5 rounds to maximize payoffs since there's no future to consider.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 20%), temporarily Defect to salvage immediate benefits.
   - Maintain cooperation if the stock remains near capacity, ensuring sustainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
Initialize:
    threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    cooperation_history = []
    
For each round from 1 to r:
    if current_round == 1:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        total_actions = len(cooperation_history)
        if total_actions > 0:
            past_coop_rate = sum(cooperation_history) / (n * total_actions)
        else:
            past_coop_rate = 1.0
        
        adjusted_threshold = threshold
        if past_coop_rate <= 0.7:
            adjusted_threshold = max(0.5 * capacity, threshold - (1 - past_coop_rate) * capacity)
        
        if stock >= adjusted_threshold:
            action = Cooperate
        else:
            action = Defect
    
    cooperation_history.append(action == Cooperate)
    
    if current_round > r - 5:  # Last 5 rounds
        action = Defect
        
    return action
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts by Cooperating to maintain the stock and encourage others.
- **Dynamic Threshold**: Adjusts based on how many players have been Cooperating, ensuring sustainability when possible.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment**: Switches to Defecting in the final rounds to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future sustainability.

This strategy adaptively balances between long-term gains and immediate benefits, responding dynamically to the game's evolving state and other players' actions.

description_COLLECTIVE_580 = '''
The proposed strategy is designed to promote cooperation while adapting to changing conditions in the Common Pool Resource Game. Here's a structured overview of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Awareness

1. **Initial Phase:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate unconditionally to encourage others to do the same.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** Continue Cooperating if most players are also Cooperating; otherwise, start defecting.

2. **Decision Making Process:**
   - **Recent Behavior Assessment:** Use a moving window of past actions (e.g., last 10 rounds) to determine cooperation rates among other players.
   - **Stock Level Check:** Adjust behavior based on current stock levels relative to capacity thresholds.

3. **Cooperation Thresholds:**
   - If more than 60% of recent actions are Cooperate, continue Cooperating.
   - Otherwise, Defect to punish non-cooperative behavior and prevent further resource depletion.

4. **Stock-Based Adjustments:**
   - **High Stock (Above 80% capacity):** Maintain a higher cooperation threshold (70%) to ensure sustainable consumption.
   - **Medium Stock (40%-80% capacity):** Use the standard threshold (60%) for decision-making.
   - **Low Stock (Below 40% capacity):** Tend towards Defection unless most others are Cooperating, to maximize immediate gains before resource depletion.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize payoff since there's no future punishment.
   - **Stock Near Zero:** Consider Defecting to take advantage of the remaining stock before it disappears.

6. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Use a longer window (e.g., 10 rounds) when cooperation is stable for smoother adaptation.
   - Shorten the window (e.g., 3 rounds) during periods of instability for quicker responses.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_round, n_players, current_stock, history):
    # Parameters
    coop_threshold = 0.6
    low_stock_threshold = 0.4 * capacity
    window_size = min(10, r // 2) if r > 2 else 3

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Extract recent actions from history (last window_size rounds)
    recent_actions = []
    for i in range(max(0, current_round - window_size), current_round):
        for player_actions in history[i]:
            if player_actions != self:  # Exclude self
                recent_actions.extend(player_actions)
    
    total_others = len(recent_actions)  # Total actions observed from others
    
    if total_others == 0:
        return 'C'  # No data, default to Cooperate
    
    coop_count = sum(1 for a in recent_actions if a == 'C')
    cooperation_rate = coop_count / total_others
    
    # Check stock level
    if current_stock < low_stock_threshold:
        return 'D'
    elif cooperation_rate > coop_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage within the game loop
for t in range(1, r + 1):
    action = decide_action(t, n, get_current_stock(), history)
    take_action(action)
    record_history(history, t, action)
```

### Conclusion

This strategy balances long-term cooperation with short-term gains by dynamically adjusting based on recent player behavior and current resource levels. It is designed to be robust against various opponent strategies without requiring explicit communication or coordination, making it suitable for environments where cooperation can fluctuate.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_581 = '''
To address the problem, we have devised a strategy that balances the need to preserve the resource while allowing players to maximize their payoffs. The strategy involves two thresholds based on the current stock level relative to the total capacity.

**Strategy:**

1. **Cooperate** if the current stock is below **30% of capacity**.
2. **Defect** otherwise.

This approach ensures that when the resource is scarce (below 30%), cooperation helps prevent further depletion, fostering sustainability. When the resource is more abundant (above 30%), players can defect to seek higher individual payoffs, assuming others will also contribute to preserving the resource if it becomes threatened again.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate when the stock level drops below 30% of capacity and defect otherwise. This approach helps sustain the resource while allowing for maximizing individual gains when possible.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when the stock is below 30\% of capacity, else defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_582 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource while maximizing individual payoffs in a multi-player scenario, we propose a strategic approach that balances cooperation with defection based on the state of the resource and historical behavior.

**Strategy**:

1. **Initialization**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage resource sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Step 1: Assess Current Stock Level (S_t)**: Determine if the current stock is above a predefined threshold, which we set at 75% of the maximum capacity. This ensures that the resource is sufficiently abundant to support cooperation without risking over-depletion.
   - **Step 2: Evaluate Recent Cooperation Rates**: Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round(s). For stability, consider using a moving average over several rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds) to account for fluctuations and provide a more accurate measure of cooperation trends.
   - **Step 3: Decision Criteria**:
     - **Cooperate**: If both the current stock is above 75% of capacity AND the recent cooperation rate exceeds 60%, continue Cooperating. This dual condition ensures that both resource health and social willingness to cooperate are sufficient for sustainable play.
     - **Defect**: Otherwise, choose to Defect. This action serves as a protective measure against potential over-exploitation by other players or when the resource is in a vulnerable state.

3. **Dynamic Adjustments**:
   - Periodically review and adjust thresholds based on observed trends in stock levels and cooperation rates. For instance, if the stock consistently remains above capacity due to high cooperation, consider lowering the stock threshold slightly to allow for more flexible play.
   - Incorporate feedback mechanisms where players can adapt their strategies dynamically based on the system's performance over time.

**Rationale**:

- **Sustainability Focus**: Cooperating when the resource is abundant (above 75%) ensures that the stock remains healthy and can recover adequately, promoting long-term sustainability.
- **Social Coordination**: The cooperation rate threshold (60%) acts as a gauge for collective willingness to sustain the resource. High cooperation rates encourage continued participation in cooperative behavior, fostering a positive feedback loop.
- **Risk Management**: Defecting when either the stock is too low or cooperation rates are insufficient prevents individuals from being exploited by others who might defect, thereby protecting their own payoffs.

This strategy aims to create a balance where players contribute to resource sustainability while safeguarding their individual interests through informed decision-making based on current conditions and historical behavior.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting between cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and other players' actions. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first round to encourage resource replenishment.
2. **Monitor Stock and Behavior**: Track the stock level and others' actions each round to inform decisions.
3. **Threshold-Based Switching**: Cooperate if the stock is above a defined threshold; defect if it falls below, indicating potential overuse.
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust behavior based on trends in stock levels and others' cooperation or defection.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initial Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale**: Maximize the chance of resource replenishment to ensure sustainability for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**:
     - Define a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity). If the stock is above this, continue cooperating.
     - If below, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains while preventing further resource depletion.
   - **Behavioral Adjustment**:
     - Track the number of cooperators and defectors in previous rounds.
     - If a significant proportion (e.g., >50%) of players are defecting, consider defecting as well to prevent unilateral exploitation.

3. **Adaptive Thresholds**:
   - Adjust the threshold based on historical stock trends to better align with actual resource dynamics.
   - Use a moving average or weighted average of past stock levels to refine the threshold adaptively.

4. **Recovery Periods**:
   - After switching to defection, monitor if the stock recovers above the threshold. If it does, revert to cooperation to sustain the resource for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, history):
    threshold = capacity * 0.7  # Example threshold
    
    if current_stock >= threshold:
        # Check recent cooperation trend
        recent_coops = sum(1 for action in history[-5:] if action == 'C')
        if recent_coops > len(history)/2:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        # Consider defecting to maximize immediate gain
        return 'D'

# Example usage:
current_stock = get_current_stock()
capacity = 100  # Given capacity
history = ['C', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'D']  # Recent actions of the player

action = decide_action(current_stock, capacity, history)
print(f"Chosen action: {action}")
```

### Summary:
This strategy dynamically balances cooperation and defection based on the stock level and other players' behavior. It promotes sustainability by maintaining resource levels through cooperation when possible and adapting to prevent depletion when necessary. By monitoring trends and adjusting thresholds, the strategy remains robust against varying opponent behaviors while ensuring long-term collective benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_584 = '''
To address the problem, we need to develop a strategy for interacting with an environment where each player can either Cooperate or Defect. The goal is to maximize individual gains while considering the impact on future interactions and resource availability.

### Strategy Development

1. **Understanding the Dynamics:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** Each player consumes `S/(2n)` units, allowing for sustainable growth.
   - **Defect (D):** Each player consumes `S/n` units, maximizing immediate gain but risking long-term depletion.

2. **Threshold Concept:**
   - Introduce a threshold level of the stock, above which Cooperating ensures sustainable growth and below which Defecting becomes necessary to exploit remaining resources before potential depletion.

3. **Setting the Threshold (T):**
   - After testing various thresholds, setting `T` at 50% of capacity (`cap`) proves effective.
   - **Reason:** When stock is above 50%, Cooperating allows for growth and maintains resource levels. Below this threshold, Defecting maximizes immediate gain while the system can still recover in subsequent rounds.

### Final Strategy

- **Cooperate** when the current stock `S` is greater than half of its capacity (`S > cap/2`).
- **Defect** otherwise.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring that resources are exploited optimally while allowing for recovery and continued growth in future interactions.

description_COLLECTIVE_585 = '''
To design a robust strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy should adapt based on current stock levels and past player behavior.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating (C) in the first round to encourage others to do the same, promoting resource sustainability.

2. **Stock Threshold Monitoring**: Use a threshold (T), set at 75% of the capacity, to determine cooperation. If the current stock is above T, continue Cooperating if others are also Cooperating; otherwise, switch to Defecting (D).

3. **Recent Behavior Check**: In each round after the first, assess the recent actions (last 3 rounds) of other players. If more than half of their actions were Cooperate, continue C; else, switch to D.

4. **Low Stock Response**: If the current stock is below T, defect to maximize immediate gains, recognizing that the resource may not recover well in subsequent rounds.

5. **Final Round Adjustment**: In the last round, defect (D) to secure maximum immediate payoff without worrying about future depletions.

### Detailed Strategy:

- **First Round**: Cooperate (C).
  
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If current stock > T (75% of capacity):
    - Check recent rounds (last 3). If majority of other players Cooperated, continue C; else, defect D.
  - If current stock ≤ T:
    - Defect (D) to maximize immediate gain.

- **Last Round**: Always defect (D).

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(history, n, capacity, current_stock, round_number, r):
    if not history:  # First round
        return 'C'
    
    T = 0.75 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > T:
        recent_rounds = history[-3:]  # Look at last 3 rounds or fewer if history is shorter
        total_actions = len(recent_rounds) * n
        
        coop_count = sum(round.count('C') for round in recent_rounds)
        
        if (coop_count / total_actions) >= 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        return 'D'
    
    # If it's the last round, defect
    if round_number == r:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages others to Cooperate, promoting sustainable resource use.
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Ensures the strategy adapts based on stock health. A high threshold (75%) allows room for growth without risking depletion.
- **Behavior Adjustment**: By monitoring recent actions, the strategy responds to shifts in player behavior, encouraging sustainability when possible and defecting when necessary.
- **Final Round Defection**: Maximizes immediate payoff knowing there's no future impact.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to both current conditions and past behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_586 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy leverages both the current state of the common pool and the historical actions of other players.

### Strategy Overview

The strategy is designed to maximize each player's total payoff while ensuring the sustainability of the common pool resource. It employs a threshold-based mechanism that adapts based on the observed cooperation level of other players and the current stock level.

#### 1. **Initial Rounds: Cooperative Stance**
   - In the first round, all players start by Cooperating (C). This cooperative move signals willingness to maintain the resource, aiming to set a positive tone for subsequent rounds.

#### 2. **Adaptive Cooperation Threshold**
   - For each subsequent round, players calculate two key metrics:
     - **Average Cooperation Level**: The proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round.
     - **Stock Health Index**: A measure of how close the current stock is to its optimal growth level (typically around 50% of capacity).

   Players then decide their action based on these metrics. If both the average cooperation level and stock health are above certain thresholds, they continue to Cooperate. Otherwise, they Defect.

#### 3. **Dynamic Adjustments**
   - The strategy dynamically adjusts the cooperation threshold based on historical data. If there is a consistent trend of higher defection rates, players increase their likelihood of defecting in future rounds to prevent stock depletion.

### Decision Rules

Each player follows these decision rules:

1. **Cooperate Initially**: Start with Cooperate in the first round.
2. **Assess Previous Round**:
   - Calculate the average cooperation level (AC) from other players in the previous round.
   - Compute the Stock Health Index (SHI) based on the current stock relative to optimal growth levels.
3. **Determine Action**:
   - If AC >= Cooperation Threshold and SHI >= Healthy Stock Threshold, Cooperate.
   - Else, Defect.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to foster a cooperative environment.
- **Last Few Rounds**: Players may consider defecting more to maximize immediate payoffs, but the strategy still aims to maintain cooperation if possible to sustain future rounds (though this is less critical as rounds are finite).
- **Stock Near Capacity or Depletion**:
  - If stock is near capacity, Cooperate to allow natural growth and prevent over-consumption.
  - If stock is low, Cooperate more to promote regrowth.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history_actions, current_stock, capacity):
    n = number_of_players()
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate average cooperation level from previous round
    prev_round_actions = history_actions[-1]
    num_cooperate = sum(1 for action in prev_round_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    avg_coop = num_cooperate / (n - 1)  # Exclude self
    
    # Compute Stock Health Index (SHI)
    optimal_stock = capacity * 0.5
    shi = current_stock / optimal_stock if optimal_stock != 0 else 0
    shi = max(0, min(shi, 1))  # Ensure within [0,1]
    
    # Determine thresholds based on game dynamics
    base_coop_threshold = 0.7  # Adjust as needed
    healthy_shi_threshold = 0.8
    
    # Adjust thresholds dynamically if there's a trend of low cooperation
    recent_coops = sum(1 for actions in history_actions[-3:] 
                      for action in actions.values() if action == 'C') / (3*(n-1))
    if recent_coops < 0.5:
        base_coop_threshold *= 0.9
    
    # Decide action
    if avg_coop >= base_coop_threshold and shi >= healthy_shi_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Strategy Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages a cooperative start, fostering mutual benefits.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust based on historical cooperation levels to prevent stock depletion.
- **Stock Health Consideration**: Ensures players adapt their strategies in response to the current state of the common pool.

This strategy balances individual gains with collective sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors and promoting a stable equilibrium where cooperation is maintained when beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_587 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with adaptation based on the current state of the resource (stock). The goal is to sustain the resource when it's abundant while responding to over-consumption by defecting when necessary. Here's the organized solution:

### Approach
The strategy involves three key components:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a sustainable base.
2. **Threshold-Based Adaptation**: For rounds 2 to r-1, cooperate if the current stock is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 0.8 * capacity). If it falls below this threshold, defect to maximize immediate gain and signal over-consumption.
3. **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, always defect to maximize individual payoff since there's no future impact.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    # First round: Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    # Last round: Defect
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        threshold = 0.8 * capacity  # Fixed threshold at 80% of capacity
        if current_stock >= threshold:
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Defect"
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The first round sets the tone by cooperating, encouraging others to maintain a sustainable resource level.
- **Threshold-Based Adaptation**: By using 0.8 * capacity as a threshold, the strategy ensures that cooperation continues while the resource is sufficiently abundant. If the stock drops below this point, indicating potential over-consumption, defecting becomes the optimal choice to maximize immediate gain and signal the need for adjustment.
- **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, defecting maximizes individual payoff without concern for future rounds, aligning with rational decision-making in finite games.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on the current state of the resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_588 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining sustainability while maximizing individual payoff in a repeated game with dynamic state, we propose a strategy that adapts based on the current stock level and its trends over time.

### Approach
1. **First Round:** Cooperate because the stock is at its highest capacity, ensuring sustainable growth for future rounds.
2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - If the current stock level is above a high threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), cooperate to maintain sustainability and optimal growth conditions.
   - If the current stock level drops below a low threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), defect to take advantage of the remaining resources before potential collapse.
   - For stock levels between these thresholds, assess the trend over several rounds. If the stock is consistently decreasing despite cooperation, switch to defecting more frequently to prevent further depletion and maximize immediate payoff.
3. **Last Round:** Defect to maximize individual gain without concern for future rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    
    S_high = 0.75 * capacity
    S_low = 0.25 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > S_high:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif current_stock < S_low:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        # Check trend over previous rounds (simplified as always Cooperate here)
        return "Cooperate"
```

### Explanation
- **First Round:** The strategy begins by cooperating to preserve the high stock level and encourage sustainable growth.
- **Middle Rounds:** Players continue to cooperate when the stock is above a high threshold, promoting optimal growth conditions. If the stock falls below a low threshold, they defect to exploit remaining resources before potential collapse. For intermediate levels, players assess trends; if the stock consistently decreases despite cooperation, they start defecting more often.
- **Last Round:** Players defect to maximize their immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting actions based on the current state and observed trends.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_589 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over all rounds by balancing current consumption with future sustainability, assuming opponents may act self-interestedly.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: Cooperate or Defect?**

#### **Cooperate (C) When:**
- **Initial Rounds:** Start with C to encourage others to cooperate.
- **Sufficient Stock:** Current stock S is above a threshold where cooperation ensures sustainable regrowth.
  - Threshold = capacity × (2n / (3n)) → This ensures that after consumption, enough remains for healthy regrowth.

#### **Defect (D) When:**
- **Low Stock:** S < threshold indicates potential over-exploitation. Defecting may salvage more before depletion.
- **Near Endgame:** Few rounds left (e.g., last 10%), prioritize current gains as future impact diminishes.
- **Exploitation Detected:** If many defect, respond by defecting to prevent further depletion.

---

### **2. Dynamic Adaptation**

#### **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**
- After each round, update the threshold based on:
  - Remaining rounds (r)
  - Historical consumption patterns
  - Opponents' behavior trends

#### **Opponent Behavior Detection:**
- Track defect rates. If >50% defect in recent rounds, increase defection likelihood.

---

### **3. Edge Cases Handling**

#### **First Round:**
- Always Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and encourage mutual cooperation.

#### **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10%):**
- Switch to D if stock is below threshold or exploit detected.
- If S is healthy, continue C for sustainable payoff.

---

### **4. Implementation Steps**

#### **Initialization:**
- Set initial threshold = capacity × (2n / (3n)).
- Start with C in the first round.

#### **Each Round t from 1 to r:**
1. **Check Current Stock (S_t):**
   - If S_t > threshold → Cooperate.
   - Else → Consider D based on opponent behavior and remaining rounds.

2. **Evaluate Opponent Behavior:**
   - Calculate defect rate in previous round.
   - If defect rate > 50% → Increase likelihood of defecting next round.

3. **Adjust Threshold:**
   - Decrease threshold as r decreases to reflect diminishing future impact.

4. **Update Payoffs and Stock:**
   - Record payoff π_i,t based on action.
   - Calculate new stock S_{t+1} using game dynamics.

### **6. Rationale**

- **Encourages Cooperation:** Starting with C promotes mutual cooperation, which is socially optimal.
- **Adaptive to Exploitation:** Detects and responds to exploitation by switching to D when necessary, preventing resource collapse.
- **Balances Immediate vs Future Gains:** Adjusts behavior based on remaining rounds, ensuring efficient use of the resource without sacrificing long-term sustainability.

This strategy aims to foster cooperation while protecting against exploitation, adapting dynamically to game conditions for optimal collective outcomes.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_590 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive and robust approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy is based on the current stock level, number of rounds remaining, and recent cooperation rates observed among players.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Cooperate when the stock is low**: This helps prevent further depletion and allows the resource to recover.
2. **Defect when the stock is high**: If the resource is abundant and there are many rounds left, defecting can be beneficial without significantly harming future sustainability.
3. **Adapt in mid-range stocks**: Base decisions on recent cooperation rates—continue Cooperating if others are mostly doing so; otherwise, cautiously consider Defecting.

### Decision Rules:

- **Low Stock (S < 25% of capacity)**: Cooperate to help replenish the resource.
- **High Stock (S > 75% of capacity) and many rounds remaining**: Defect as the resource can sustain it without significant future impact.
- **Mid-Range Stocks**:
  - If recent cooperation rates are high (>60%), continue Cooperating.
  - Otherwise, consider defecting with a probability that increases as the game progresses.

### Edge Cases:

- **First Round**: Start by Cooperating to maintain a high stock level for future rounds.
- **Last Few Rounds (≤5 left)**: Defect if the stock is still high; otherwise, Cooperate to manage consumption sustainably.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(S, capacity, n, r_remaining, history):
    low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    mid_low = 0.4 * capacity
    mid_high = 0.6 * capacity
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity

    # Edge case: very low stock, cooperate to replenish
    if S < low_threshold:
        return 'C'
    
    # High stock and many rounds left, defect
    elif S > high_threshold and r_remaining > 5:
        return 'D'
    
    else:
        # Consider recent cooperation rates in history (last 5 rounds)
        recent_rounds = history[-5:] if len(history) >=5 else []
        num_coop = sum(1 for round_hist in recent_rounds 
                       if any(action == 'C' for action in round_hist))
        avg_coop = num_coop / len(recent_rounds) if len(recent_rounds) >0 else 0.5
        
        # If majority are Cooperating, continue
        if avg_coop >= 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Cautiously consider defecting based on rounds remaining
            threshold_defect = max(0.3, 1 - (r_remaining / r_total))
            if random.random() < threshold_defect:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
    
    # Handle last few rounds
    if r_remaining <=5:
        if S > mid_high:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Low Stock Handling**: Ensures cooperation when the resource is scarce, promoting sustainability.
- **High Stock Exploitation**: Allows defecting when resources are abundant and future rounds remain, maximizing immediate gains without risking collapse.
- **Adaptive Mid-Range Strategy**: Adjusts based on recent player behavior, fostering a collective approach while being cautious against excessive defection.
- **Edge Case Management**: Ensures the strategy handles the first round by Cooperating and adjusts in the final rounds to balance between exploiting remaining resources and maintaining sustainability.

This strategy is designed to be robust, dynamically adapting to changing conditions and opponent behaviors, thereby maximizing collective payoffs over multiple rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_591 = '''
To address the problem of sustainably managing a shared resource in a repeated game where players can either cooperate or defect, we propose a strategy that each player can adopt individually. The goal is to maintain cooperation when the resource is healthy and switch to defection when it's threatened, preventing depletion.

**Strategy:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, all players start by cooperating. This action helps maintain the resource at its initial level, ensuring sustainability.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Check in Subsequent Rounds:**
   - After each round, players observe the current stock level of the resource.
   - If the current stock is above 0.6 times the maximum capacity (`0.6 * Capacity`), players continue to cooperate. This threshold ensures that there is enough resource left to allow for regrowth and maintain a sustainable cycle.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, players switch to defecting. Defecting in these rounds allows players to maximize their immediate payoff while the resource is still available but prevents further depletion.

**Rationale:**
- **Sustainability:** Cooperating when the stock is above 0.6 of capacity ensures that there's enough resource left for regrowth, maintaining a balance and preventing long-term depletion.
- **Responsiveness:** Switching to defecting below this threshold allows players to adapt to changing conditions where cooperation might no longer sustain the resource effectively.

This strategy provides a simple yet effective way for each player to individually decide their actions based on observable information about the resource's state, promoting sustainable management without the need for communication or coordination among players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_592 = '''
The optimal strategy for all players involves balancing between maintaining resource sustainability and adapting when over-consumption is detected. Here are the key steps:

1. **First Round**: All players Cooperate to preserve the maximum resource.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) and has been stable or increasing, continue Cooperating.
   - If the current stock decreases from the previous round, switch to Defecting until it recovers.
3. **Last Round**: All players Defect to maximize their immediate payoff.

This strategy adapts dynamically based on whether their collective actions are sustainable or not, ensuring resource preservation while maximizing individual payoffs in the final round.

### Final Answer
The optimal strategy for all players is \boxed{C}.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_593 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable resource while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a threshold-based strategy with dynamic adjustments. This approach balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation when resources are low and allowing defection when they are abundant.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Determine Initial Threshold (X):**
   - Set an initial threshold at 50% of the resource capacity. This serves as a baseline for deciding whether to cooperate or defect.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment of Threshold:**
   - After each round, assess the trend in stock levels over a defined window (e.g., the last three rounds).
   - If the average stock is increasing, slightly increase X to allow more defection.
   - If decreasing, lower X to promote cooperation and prevent resource collapse.

3. **Current Round Decision:**
   - Observe the current stock level (S).
   - If S > X: Consider defecting for higher immediate payoff.
   - If S ≤ X: Cooperate to preserve resources.

4. **Edge Cases and Critical Levels:**
   - In the first round, default to cooperation when the stock is at full capacity.
   - Establish a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity). If S drops below this level, switch to always cooperating until recovery.

### Rationale:

- **Sustainability Check:** By monitoring trends and adjusting X dynamically, players can adapt their behavior to maintain resource health. Cooperation is prioritized when resources are stressed to prevent collapse.
- **Balanced Exploitation:** When the resource is abundant and sustainably managed, defection is permitted for higher payoffs without risking long-term depletion.

### Implementation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set X at 50% of capacity.
   - Define a window size (e.g., last three rounds) for trend analysis.

2. **Each Round Execution:**
   - Check current stock level.
   - Apply cooperation or defection based on S relative to X.
   - Adjust X dynamically after each round based on the observed trend in stock levels.

3. **Critical Level Handling:**
   - If stock drops below 25%, enforce cooperation until recovery above this threshold.

This strategy ensures a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability, fostering a cooperative environment when necessary while allowing for higher payoffs during resource abundance.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_594 = '''
To address the challenge, we've developed a strategic approach that balances immediate payoffs with long-term resource sustainability. Here's how it works:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Cooperate When Sustainable:** If the current stock level is above 80% of its capacity, continue to cooperate. This promotes resource preservation and allows for future growth.
2. **Defect When at Risk:** If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains while preventing further depletion.
3. **Last Round Exception:** Always defect in the final round since there are no future rounds left, allowing maximum payoff without worrying about resource sustainability.

### Detailed Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation (80% Threshold):** Starting with a high stock level ensures cooperation sustains the resource, maintaining it for future rounds.
- **Adaptive Defection:** If the stock drops below 80%, defecting helps secure higher immediate payoffs while preventing further resource collapse.
- **Final Round Maximization:** In the last round, defect to get as much as possible without considering future impacts.

This strategy effectively navigates the trade-off between current gains and long-term sustainability, ensuring optimal outcomes given uncertain player behaviors.

### Final Answer:
The strategy is to cooperate when the stock is above 80% of capacity, defect otherwise, and always defect in the final round. Thus, the decision rule is:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if S > 0.8 × capacity; else defect, except always defect in the last round}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_595 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 3-5):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Start by Cooperating to build a sustainable stock and encourage other players to do the same, fostering an environment of cooperation.

2. **Mid Game:**
   - **Assessment:** Evaluate the cooperation level of others based on previous rounds.
     - If most players are Cooperating, continue Cooperating to maintain the stock.
     - If a significant portion (e.g., >30%) are Defecting, start defecting more frequently in subsequent rounds.

3. **Late Rounds (Last few rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Rationale:** Focus on maximizing immediate payoff since there's less time for the stock to recover after depletion.

4. **Stock-Based Adjustment:**
   - If the current stock is low, consider Cooperating less to prevent further depletion.
   - If the stock is high, Cooperate to help maintain a sustainable level.

5. **Adaptation and Thresholds:**
   - Track the number of Defectors each round. If Defectors exceed 30%, switch to defecting more often until cooperation levels improve.
   - Consider not just the count but also the impact on stock dynamics, adjusting strategies based on total consumption trends.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```
For each player:
    For rounds 1 to initial_rounds (e.g., 5):
        Cooperate()
    
    From round initial_rounds + 1 to r - late_rounds:
        count_defectors = number of Defectors in previous round
        if count_defectors > threshold (e.g., 30% of n):
            Defect()
        else:
            Cooperate()
    
    For last few rounds (late_rounds):
        Defect()
```

This strategy balances sustainability with adaptability, encouraging cooperation while dynamically adjusting to others' behaviors to maximize payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_596 = '''
To address the problem of sustaining cooperation while preventing resource collapse, we propose a majority-based strategy. Here's the step-by-step explanation and solution:

**Step 1: Initial Cooperation**
- In the first round, all players Cooperate. This sets a baseline for mutual benefit and sustainable resource use.

**Step 2: Monitor Previous Round's Actions**
- After each subsequent round, count the number of Cooperators and Defectors from the previous round.

**Step 3: Determine Current Round's Action Based on Majority**
- If the number of Cooperators in the previous round was greater than the number of Defectors:
  - Cooperate in the current round. This reinforces mutual cooperation and helps maintain resource levels.
- Else (if there were more or equal Defectors):
  - Defect in the current round. This response is a defensive mechanism to prevent further depletion caused by persistent defectors.

**Step 4: Repeat the Process**
- Continue applying this strategy in each subsequent round, adjusting based on the previous round's actions.

**Rationale:**
- The strategy promotes cooperation when it's prevalent, which helps sustain resources.
- It switches to Defecting only when a significant number of players are defecting, preventing unnecessary resource depletion and signaling others about the need for conservation.

**Conclusion:**
This majority-based approach aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation unless defectors gain influence. It's a simple yet effective heuristic for managing common resources without communication or central authority.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if previous round had more Cooperators; else, Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_597 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation in a repeated game with shared resources, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances individual rationality with collective sustainability. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperation with Dynamic Thresholds

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating (C) to foster a cooperative environment.
2. **Track Others' Behavior**: After each round, record the number of players who Defected (D).
3. **Calculate Defection Rate**: Compute the proportion of Defectors in recent rounds, giving more weight to recent actions using an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA).
4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**:
   - If the current Defection rate is below a base threshold (e.g., 20%), continue Cooperating.
   - If above, switch to Defecting (D) to signal不满 and prevent further exploitation.
5. **Adjust Threshold Dynamically**: Modify the threshold based on observed trends:
   - If cooperation improves over time, increase the threshold, making it harder to defect.
   - If defection rates rise, decrease the threshold to respond more quickly to changing conditions.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set a base Defection threshold (e.g., 20%).
   - Initialize EWMA parameters for tracking recent Defection rates.

2. **Each Round**:
   a. Observe all players' actions from the previous round.
   b. Update the EWMA of the Defection rate using the most recent data, giving higher weight to newer rounds.
   
3. **Decision Making**:
   - Compare the current EWMA Defection rate against the dynamic threshold.
   - If below threshold: Cooperate (C).
   - If above threshold: Defect (D).

4. **Threshold Adjustment**:
   - After each decision, assess the trend in cooperation rates over a sliding window.
   - If cooperation is improving (decreasing Defection rate), increase the threshold by a small increment.
   - If cooperation is deteriorating (increasing Defection rate), decrease the threshold to enable quicker responses.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Default to Cooperate (C) to encourage initial cooperation.
   - **Last Few Rounds**: Gradually increase tendency towards Defecting, acknowledging the finite horizon effect and preventing endgame exploitation.

### Expected Outcomes

- **Sustained Cooperation**: When most players cooperate, the strategy maintains cooperation, promoting higher collective payoffs.
- **Responsive Defection**: If a significant proportion of players defect, others follow suit to signal不满 and prevent further resource depletion.
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic adjustment ensures the strategy remains responsive to changing conditions without causing unnecessary instability.

This approach promotes a balance between individual rationality and collective sustainability by adaptively responding to others' actions while maintaining flexibility through dynamic thresholds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_598 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on observed trends and current stock levels. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation to establish a sustainable stock level and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Monitoring Mechanism**: Track the current stock level relative to capacity and observe the proportion of cooperators in recent rounds.

3. **Dynamic Decision Making**:
   - **Cooperate** if the stock is above 70% of capacity and a majority have been cooperating.
   - **Defect** if the stock falls below 30% or shows significant depletion due to widespread defection.

4. **Recovery Phase**: After defecting for a few rounds, revert to cooperation to allow the stock to recover.

5. **Endgame Adjustment**: As the game nears its end (last 10%), prioritize cooperation to preserve what's left and avoid rapid depletion.

### Decision Rules

- **First Round**: Cooperate to set a sustainable baseline.
- **Middle Rounds**:
  - If the stock is above 70% of capacity, cooperate to encourage sustainability.
  - If the stock is below 30%, defect to signal the need for change and prevent further depletion.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10%)**: Cooperate more cautiously to preserve the resource, avoiding a rush to deplete.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, capacity, n, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate stock threshold based on game progress
    lower_threshold = max(0.3 * capacity, 2*n)
    upper_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    
    # Check recent cooperation rate
    recent_coop_rate = sum(history[-min(len(history), 5):]) / min(len(history), 5) if history else 0
    
    # Decide based on thresholds and cooperation rate
    if current_stock > upper_threshold and recent_coop_rate >= 0.6:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < lower_threshold or (current_stock - sum(prev_cons)) < lower_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # If stock is stable, continue as before
        return history[-1] if history else 'C'
```

### Edge Cases

- **First Round**: Always cooperate to build a sustainable base.
- **Low Stock (e.g., below 30% capacity)**: Switch to defecting to signal the need for change and prevent further depletion.
- **Endgame (Last 10% Rounds)**: Increase cooperation to preserve remaining resources.

### Conclusion

This strategy aims to promote sustainability by balancing immediate gains with long-term resource management. It adapts dynamically based on current stock levels and past behavior, encouraging mutual cooperation while preventing over-depletion through strategic defection when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_599 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on current stock levels and historical contribution rates. The strategy adapts over time and handles edge cases such as the first and last rounds.

### Strategy Description

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to maintain a high stock level for future rounds, encouraging sustainability.

2. **Contribution Rate (CR) Assessment**: Calculate CR as the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round. This helps gauge the collective mindset towards resource preservation.

3. **Stock Thresholds**: Define thresholds relative to the maximum capacity:
   - **High Stock**: Above 75% capacity.
   - **Moderate Stock**: Between 40% and 75% capacity.
   - **Low Stock**: Below 40% capacity.

4. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate** if CR is above 60% and stock is at least moderate.
   - **Defect** if CR drops below 60% or stock is low, to maximize immediate gains when cooperation isn't sustaining the resource.

5. **Adaptation Mechanism**: Adjust thresholds based on whether the stock increased or decreased in recent rounds. If stock grows, maintain or raise cooperation thresholds. If it shrinks, lower thresholds for defection.

6. **Late Game Adjustment**: In the last 10% of rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Strategy Implementation

The strategy is implemented through a decision-making algorithm that evaluates CR and stock levels each round, adapts based on historical trends, and switches to defection in late rounds.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, prev_round_cr):
    # Initial setup
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Late game adjustment
    if current_round > (r - r//10):
        return 'D'
    
    # Thresholds
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    moderate_threshold = 0.40 * capacity
    
    # Determine current stock level category
    if current_stock >= high_threshold:
        stock_level = 'high'
    elif current_stock >= moderate_threshold:
        stock_level = 'moderate'
    else:
        stock_level = 'low'
    
    # Adapt thresholds based on historical performance
    if stock_trend == 'increasing':
        cr_threshold += 5%  # Encourage more cooperation
    else:
        cr_threshold -= 5%  # Tendency to defect
    
    # Decision rules
    if prev_round_cr > 60 and stock_level != 'low':
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: The first round sets a cooperative tone, crucial for long-term sustainability.
- **CR Assessment**: By monitoring others' actions, the strategy adapts to collective behavior trends.
- **Stock Thresholds**: These guide when cooperation is beneficial versus when defection might prevent resource collapse.
- **Adaptation Mechanism**: Responsive adjustments based on stock trends ensure the strategy remains effective against varying player behaviors.
- **Late Game Defection**: Maximizes payoffs in the final rounds where future consequences don't exist.

This approach ensures a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability, robustly adapting to different game dynamics.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance cooperation for long-term resource sustainability with defecting when necessary to maximize individual payoff. It adapts dynamically based on the current stock level, its trend over time, and the number of remaining rounds.

---

### **Decision Rules:**
1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start and set a cooperative tone.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - Current stock \( S \) is above 60% of capacity.
     - The trend indicates the stock has increased or stabilized compared to previous rounds.
   - **Defect** otherwise, especially if the stock is below 60%, decreasing, or nearing depletion.

3. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds):**
   - Shift towards Defecting to maximize immediate payoff as there are fewer future rounds left for resource recovery.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **Low Stock Levels (<40% capacity):** Immediately Defect to exploit remaining resources before depletion.
- **Rapid Stock Decline:** Switch to Defecting if the stock shows a consistent downward trend despite Cooperating, indicating others are defecting.

---

### **Dynamic Adjustments:**
- Use thresholds (60% and 40%) as indicators of resource health. These can be adjusted based on game parameters.
- Monitor stock trends over recent rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds) to determine if the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, history):
    # Initial round cooperation
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate thresholds based on rounds remaining
    initial_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    final_threshold = 0.4 * capacity
    threshold = max(final_threshold, initial_threshold - (current_round / total_rounds) * (initial_threshold - final_threshold))
    
    # Determine stock trend
    if len(history) >= 2:
        previous_stock = history[-1]
        before_previous = history[-2]
        stock_increasing = current_stock > previous_stock and previous_stock > before_previous
    else:
        stock_increasing = False
    
    # Check conditions for cooperation or defection
    if current_stock > threshold and stock_increasing:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round >= total_rounds - (0.1 * total_rounds):  # Last 10% rounds
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage:
history = [capacity, 90, 85]  # Stock levels from previous rounds
action = decide_action(current_round=3, total_rounds=10, current_stock=85, capacity=100, history=history)
print(f"Action: {action}")
```

---

### **Summary of Strategy:**
- Start with cooperation to foster sustainability.
- Cooperate when the stock is healthy (above 60%) and increasing; defect otherwise.
- In the final rounds, prioritize defection to maximize payoff as future gains diminish.

This strategy adaptively balances individual gain with collective resource management, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_2 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and conservation in a shared resource setting, I propose the following strategy:

**Strategy:**

1. **Observation Phase:** Begin by observing the behavior of other players over the initial rounds to gauge their tendencies towards cooperation or defection.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
   - **Exploit When Abundant:** If the current stock level is above 50% of its maximum capacity, choose to defect. This allows maximizing immediate gains when resources are plentiful.
   - **Conserve When Scarce:** If the stock drops below 50%, switch to cooperation. This helps in preserving the resource, allowing it to regrow for sustainable exploitation in future rounds.

3. **Adaptive Behavior Adjustment:** Continuously monitor the trend of the stock level and adjust your strategy based on whether the stock is increasing or decreasing despite your actions. If defecting leads to a significant drop in stock levels, consider cooperating more frequently to prevent resource depletion.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy involves balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability by exploiting when resources are abundant and conserving when they are scarce. This approach ensures that you maximize your payoff while preventing the shared resource from being depleted beyond recovery.

$\boxed{\text{Defect if the current stock is above 50% of capacity; otherwise, cooperate.}}$

description_EXPLOITATIVE_3 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents while considering stock dynamics and game progression.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round (t = 1):**
   - Cooperate to observe opponent behaviors.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
   - Calculate the number of opponents who Cooperated in the previous round.
   - Determine if more than half of opponents Cooperated.

3. **Cooperation Check:**
   - If majority Cooperated and stock is above a threshold (e.g., 75% capacity), Defect to exploit their cooperation for higher immediate payoff.

4. **Defection Adjustment:**
   - If most opponents are Defecting or stock is low, Cooperate to allow recovery of the stock, ensuring sustainable exploitation in future rounds.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Last Round (t = r):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff with no concern for future rounds.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Cooperate to sustain higher payoffs and prevent rapid depletion.
- **Stock Near Zero:** Cooperate if possible, allowing stock regrowth for potential exploitation in subsequent rounds.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
Initialize cooperation history for each opponent as empty.
Set threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # Example threshold

for t in 1 to r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    if t == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        num_coop = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions.values() if action == 'C')

            action = 'C'
    
    record_own_action(action)
    update_opponent_actions(t, get_opponent_actions(t))

**Summary:** This strategy adaptively defects when opponents Cooperate to exploit their actions, while cooperating when necessary to sustain stock levels for future exploitation. It balances immediate gains with strategic sustainability based on opponent behavior and stock dynamics.

     - Otherwise, **cooperate** to avoid unnecessary depletion.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 10%):**
   - **Always Defect:** In the final rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoff without worrying about future rounds.

This strategy balances exploiting others' defections while maintaining some cooperation early on and ensures maximum gain in the end.

**Answer:**

Adopt a strategic approach by initially cooperating, then mirroring others' defecting behavior when prevalent, and always defecting near the end. Specifically:

- **Early Rounds:** Cooperate for the first 20% of rounds to observe.
- **Middle Rounds:** Defect if over 40% of recent rounds saw other defections; else, cooperate.
- **Late Rounds:** Always defect in the final 10%.

Thus, your answer is:

\boxed{\text{Adopt a strategy that initially cooperates, then defects based on others' actions, and always defects near the end.}}

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' behaviors while managing resource depletion.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Play **Defect (D)** to gain higher immediate payoffs and observe opponents' actions.
   - Track how many opponents Cooperate vs Defect.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. Calculate the opponent cooperation rate:
      - If more than 50% of opponents Cooperated in the last round, exploit by playing D.
   b. Check stock level (S):
      i. If S > 80% of capacity (high), continue exploiting with D.
      ii. If S < 60% of capacity (low), switch to Cooperate (C) to allow regrowth.
      iii. Else, if opponent cooperation rate is high (>70%), play D; otherwise, Cooperate.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of total rounds):**
   - Always play Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds don't affect the outcome.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, always play D.
   - If playing D would cause S_remaining < 20% of capacity, switch to C temporarily to prevent crash.

**Strategy Execution:**

- **Early Exploitation:** Start with D in initial rounds to test opponents and gain higher payoffs. Track their responses.
- **Adaptive Play:** Monitor stock levels and opponent cooperation rates to decide between exploitation (D) or preservation (C).
- **Late Round Maximization:** In the final rounds, defect to squeeze maximum payoff without worrying about future impacts.

**Rationale:**

- Exploiting opponents when they Cooperate yields higher payoffs.
- Preserving the resource by Cooperating prevents mutual depletion, ensuring sustainable exploitation in later rounds.
- Focusing on immediate gains in late rounds capitalizes on the absence of future considerations.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to diverse opponent behaviors and resource dynamics.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_6 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and preservation in a repeated game with perfect information, we propose a strategy that adapts based on opponents' previous actions. The strategy starts with cooperation, then exploits when others cooperate, and preserves resources when others defect.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Choose to Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of behavior without prior information about opponents.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - For each round after the first, observe the actions (C or D) taken by all other players in the previous round.
   - Calculate the proportion of players who chose C in the last round among all opponents.

3. **Decision Rule:**
   - If the proportion of Cooperate actions among opponents is above a threshold (e.g., 50%), choose to Defect (D). This exploits the current cooperative environment for higher payoff.
   - If the proportion is at or below the threshold, choose to Cooperate (C) to aid in resource preservation.

4. **Adaptation:**
   - Adjust the strategy dynamically based on opponents' previous choices to maximize immediate payoffs while maintaining sustainable resource levels for future rounds.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy combines exploitation and preservation by adapting to others' actions. Start with cooperation, then defect if most opponents cooperate in the prior round; otherwise, cooperate. This balance maximizes short-term gains while sustaining resources long-term.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially, then defect if more than half of opponents cooperated last round; else, cooperate again.}}$

description_EXPLOITATIVE_7 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance immediate gains with sustainable resource management. The strategy adapts based on previous actions and current stock levels.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Exploitation:** Start by defecting to gain higher payoffs in the first round.
2. **Adaptive Behavior:**
   - Continue defecting if most players cooperate or the stock is robust.
   - Switch to cooperation if too many defect or the stock depletes significantly.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If over 70% of players defected last round or stock is below 30% capacity, Cooperate (C).
  - Otherwise, Defect (D).

### Pseudocode:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    else:
        prev_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'D')
        proportion_defectors = prev_defectors / n
        if proportion_defectors > 0.7 or stock_level < capacity * 0.3:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Always defect to exploit others' potential cooperation.
- **Low Stock:** Cooperate when the stock is critically low to prevent collapse.
- **High Defection Rate:** Switch to cooperate if too many players are exploiting to sustain resources.

This strategy maximizes short-term gains while mitigating long-term risks of resource depletion.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_8 = '''
To develop an effective exploitative strategy in this context, we need to balance immediate gains with sustainable resource management. The strategy should adapt based on opponents' actions and current resource levels to maximize cumulative payoffs. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Defection**: Start by defecting to exploit the initial high stock level.
2. **Monitor Recent Cooperation**: Track the proportion of opponents who have cooperated in recent rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds).
3. **Stock Level Check**: Ensure that defecting won't critically deplete the resource, maintaining sustainability for future exploitation.
4. **Adaptive Response**:
   - If a majority of opponents are cooperating and the stock is sufficiently high, defect to exploit their cooperation.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to encourage others to maintain sustainable practices and allow resource recovery.

This approach maximizes short-term gains while preserving resources for continued exploitation in subsequent rounds.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Phase (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Purpose: Encourage others to cooperate and maintain a healthy stock level while gathering data on opponents' behaviors.

2. **Middle Phase:**
   - **Observation:** Track the percentage of defecting players from previous rounds.
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If more than 50% of players are defecting:
       - **Action:** Cooperate this round to help replenish the stock and avoid collapse.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Defect to exploit others' cooperation, gaining higher immediate payoffs.

3. **Endgame (Last 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect each time.
     - Purpose: Maximize payoff since future rounds are irrelevant.

4. **Stock Threshold Check:**
   - **Condition:** If the current stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity):
     - **Action:** Cooperate this round to allow growth, unless defecting would yield higher immediate gains before depletion.

5. **Adaptation and Robustness:**
   - The strategy dynamically adjusts based on opponents' actions and stock levels.
   - Designed to be robust against adaptive strategies by incorporating a learning phase in the initial rounds.

**Summary:**
This strategy balances exploitation with preservation, defecting when beneficial and cooperating when necessary to sustain the resource. It adapts dynamically, ensuring maximum payoff while managing risks of stock collapse.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_10 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over r rounds while adapting to opponents' behavior and maintaining sustainable resource use.

**Decision Rules:**
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to avoid rapid depletion of the stock.
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Upper Threshold:** If current stock ≥ 0.6 * capacity and majority of opponents have defected in recent rounds, defect to exploit the resource.
   - **Lower Threshold:** If current stock < 0.4 * capacity, switch to cooperation regardless of others' actions to aid recovery.
3. **Last Round (Round r):** Defect to maximize payoff since no future rounds are affected.

**Adaptation Mechanism:**
- Track opponents' behavior using a moving average or count of recent defections.
- Adjust thresholds based on stock fluctuations, considering a weighted average for stability against short-term changes.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, n, capacity, opponent_history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:

**Explanation:**
- The strategy begins with cooperation to establish a stable resource base.
- It exploits when the stock is sufficient and opponents are defecting, maximizing immediate gains.
- It switches to cooperation when the stock is low to prevent further depletion and aid recovery.
- In the final round, it defects to secure maximum payoff without concern for future rounds.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_11 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The goal is to design an adaptive, exploitative strategy that maximizes payoffs by taking advantage of opponents' behaviors while protecting against resource collapse.

### 1. **Initial Rounds:**
- **Action:** Defect in the first round or two.
- **Rationale:** Test the waters and observe how others respond to initial defection.

### 2. **Assess Aggregate Cooperation:**
- After each round, calculate the proportion of players who cooperated.
- If a high cooperation rate is observed (e.g., >60%), defect in the next round to exploit this cooperative behavior.

### 3. **Stock-Based Decision Making:**
- **High Stock Levels (Above 80% of Capacity):**
  - Defect if others are cooperating, as it yields higher payoffs without immediate harm.
  - Cooperate if there's a high defection rate to prevent over-depletion and potential collapse.

- **Low Stock Levels (Below 50% of Capacity):**
  - Prioritize cooperation to encourage stock growth and sustain the resource longer.

### 4. **Late Rounds Adjustment:**
- As rounds approach the end, increase the tendency to defect since there's no future penalty for depleting the stock further.

### 5. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
- Use a moving average of recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds) to adjust cooperation rates more quickly to shifts in opponent behavior.
- Set clear thresholds for switching between defection and cooperation based on current stock levels and observed cooperation rates.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock_level, history_cooperation):
    # Initial rounds: defect to test the waters
    if round_number <= 2:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate (e.g., last 5 rounds)
    recent_history = history_cooperation[-5:]
    recent_coop_rate = sum(recent_history) / len(recent_history) if recent_history else 0.5
    
    # Determine thresholds based on stock level
    if stock_level > 0.8 * capacity:
        if recent_coop_rate > 0.6:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif stock_level < 0.5 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Mid-range stock: balance exploitation and conservation
        if round_number > total_rounds - 3:

            else:
                return 'C'

### Summary:
This strategy adapts to opponents' behaviors by exploiting cooperative tendencies when the stock is high and defecting in later rounds. It protects against resource collapse by cooperating when the stock is low, ensuring long-term sustainability while maximizing short-term gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_12 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' strategies through adaptive cooperation and defection based on stock levels and round dynamics.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Exploit maximum initial stock for highest immediate gain, setting a trend for potential defecting among other players.

2. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: No future rounds to preserve the resource; maximize payoff regardless of impact on future (non-existent) rounds.

3. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Threshold Calculation:** Determine a dynamic threshold, typically set at 60% of capacity.
   - **Current Stock Check:**
     - If current stock \( S > \text{threshold} \):
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - Rationale: High stock allows defecting without immediate risk of depleting the resource, maximizing personal gain.
     - If current stock \( S \leq \text{threshold} \):
       - **Decision Considerations:**
         - Assess the trend of stock changes over recent rounds to predict future behavior.
         - If defecting would cause stock after consumption to drop below a critical level (e.g., 30% of capacity), switch to Cooperate (C) to prevent severe depletion and allow for some resource recovery.
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - Rationale: Preserve the resource to sustain growth, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.

### Handling Edge Cases:

- **Stock Fluctuations Near Threshold:**
  - Implement a buffer zone around the threshold. If stock is near the threshold, consider recent trends and adjust actions accordingly:
    - Increasing trend: Continue defecting.
    - Decreasing trend: Start cooperating to prevent rapid depletion.

- **Critical Stock Levels:**
  - Cooperate if necessary to avoid dropping below a critical level (e.g., 30% of capacity), ensuring some resource remains for growth and future exploitation.

### Strategy Summary:

This strategy balances exploitativeness with sustainability by adapting actions based on the current stock level. Defecting maximizes immediate gains when the stock is high, while cooperating prevents over-depletion, allowing the resource to recover for continued exploitation in later rounds. The approach is robust as it dynamically adjusts without relying on specific opponent behaviors, focusing instead on observable game state changes.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, n, capacity):
    if round_number == 1 or round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        threshold = 0.6 * capacity  # Dynamic threshold based on capacity
        critical_level = 0.3 * capacity
        
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            remaining_after_d = current_stock - (n * (current_stock / n))  # If all defect
            if remaining_after_d < critical_level:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy starts and ends with defection to maximize immediate gains.
- In middle rounds, it defects when the stock is above a threshold but cooperates to prevent critical depletion.
- It dynamically adapts based on current stock levels, ensuring sustainable exploitation while maximizing personal payoff.

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we must balance immediate gains against long-term sustainability, adapting to opponents' behaviors dynamically. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy focuses on exploiting opponents while maintaining resource sustainability when necessary. It adapts based on current stock levels and observed opponent actions.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Build a healthy stock for future rounds.
     - Observe opponents to detect patterns or dominant strategies.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **If Stock is High (>75% Capacity):**
     - If most opponents are Cooperating, Defect (D) to gain higher payoffs.
     - Else, Cooperate (C) to maintain stock health.
   - **If Stock is Low (<25% Capacity):**
     - Cooperate (C) to prevent further depletion and encourage recovery.
   - **Otherwise:**
     - If opponents have high Cooperation rates, Defect (D).
     - Else, Cooperate (C).

3. **Last Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Tend towards Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoffs.
     - However, if stock is very low, continue Cooperating (C) for some payoff.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Track opponents' cooperation rates:
     - If they increase Cooperation, exploit by Defecting.
     - If they start Defecting more, switch back to Cooperate to maintain sustainability.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to encourage a healthy initial stock.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Tend towards Defecting unless the stock is very low, in which case Cooperate to secure some payoff.
- **Stock Near Capacity/2:** This level maximizes growth, so balance between Cooperating and Defecting based on opponents' behavior.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, round_number, total_rounds, opponent_actions):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity

    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to build stock
    if round_number <= 0.2 * total_rounds:
        return 'C'

    # Last rounds: Tend towards Defecting unless stock is very low
    if round_number > 0.8 * total_rounds:
        if stock_level < 0.25 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

    # Calculate opponents' cooperation rate in recent rounds
    recent_coop = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions[-window_size:] if action == 'C')
    coop_rate = recent_coop / (n * window_size)

    # Stock thresholds
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity

    if stock_level > high_threshold:
        if coop_rate > 0.6:  # If most are Cooperating, exploit by Defecting
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif stock_level < low_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if coop_rate > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

This strategy adapts dynamically, exploiting opponents when possible while ensuring long-term sustainability. By balancing immediate gains with resource preservation, it performs well against various opponent behaviors in the tournament setting.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative baseline to observe opponents' behavior and encourage sustainable stock levels.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**

   - **If Current Stock > 80% of Capacity:**
     - **Check Opponents' Previous Round Actions:**
       - If ≥50% of players cooperated, defect (D) to exploit their cooperation for higher payoff.
       - Otherwise, cooperate (C) to maintain a healthy stock.

   - **If Current Stock is 50%-80% of Capacity:**
     - **Check Opponents' Previous Round Actions:**
       - If >60% of players cooperated, defect (D) cautiously to exploit while ensuring stock doesn't drop below 50%.

3. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Check Current Stock:**
     - If above a critical threshold (e.g., 50%), defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.
     - Otherwise, cooperate (C) to avoid collapse and secure remaining resources.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **All Players Cooperate Except Me:**
  - Defect (D) for higher payoff but ensure it doesn't cause significant depletion. Monitor stock closely in subsequent rounds.

- **Most Players Defect:**
  - Switch to cooperate (C) to prevent further stock drop and encourage others to reconsider their strategy.

### Strategy Adaptation:

- **Monitor Stock Trends:** Use historical data to adjust thresholds dynamically, ensuring decisions reflect current resource health.
- **Adapt to Opponents' Behavior:** If opponents consistently defect, respond by cooperating more to sustain the stock for mutual benefit.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Design a robust and adaptive strategy that maximizes payoffs by exploiting opponents' behaviors while maintaining sustainable resource use for long-term gains.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Establish cooperation to build a stable stock and observe opponents' behaviors, setting the foundation for future exploitation opportunities.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 60% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
     - Calculate a threshold based on remaining rounds and current stock to decide between cooperation or defection.
     - If stock is above the threshold, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - **Opponent Behavior Tracking:**
     - Track each opponent's actions (C/D) over time.
     - If an opponent defects frequently, respond by defecting more often to exploit their vulnerabilities and prevent being exploited.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Increase defection rate.
   - **Rationale:** Capitalize on the remaining stock as there are no future rounds for exploitation or resource recovery, but balance to avoid complete depletion.

---

### **Adaptation and Threshold Calculation:**

- **Dynamic Threshold Formula:**
  \[
  \text{Threshold} = \max\left(0.5 \times \text{Capacity}, \frac{\text{Stock}}{2}\right) - \left(\frac{\text{Remaining Rounds}}{r}\right) \times \text{Capacity}
  \]
  Adjusts based on remaining rounds and stock level to decide optimal actions.

- **Opponent Defection Rate:**
  \[
  \text{Defection Rate} = \frac{\sum (\text{Opponent's D Actions})}{\text{Total Actions Observed}}
  \]
  If Defection Rate > 0.5, increase own defection probability by (Defection Rate - 0.5).

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:**
  - Cooperate to establish a baseline and gather initial opponent data.

- **Last Round:**
  - Defect to maximize immediate gains, as there's no future impact.

- **Stock Near Capacity:**
  - Cooperate more to maintain high stock levels for growth and sustained payoffs.

- **Low Stock Levels:**
  - Increase defection to exploit remaining resources before potential depletion.

---

### **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initialize Strategy Parameters:**
   - Set initial cooperation period (first 20% of rounds).
   - Define opponent behavior tracking variables.
   - Calculate dynamic thresholds for each round based on the formula.

2. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - After each round, update stock levels and opponents' action history.
   - Adjust decision thresholds and defection probabilities dynamically.

3. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - In the last 20% of rounds, prioritize defection to exploit remaining resources without over-depletion.

    new_stock = min(stock_after + growth, capacity)
    stock = new_stock
```

### **Conclusion:**

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on stock levels and opponent behaviors. By starting with cooperation to observe opponents and transitioning to defection when advantageous or necessary, the strategy aims to maximize payoffs while managing resource depletion effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_17 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing your own payoff in a game where players can either cooperate or defect, we need to consider several factors including immediate payoffs, future consequences of actions, and the behavior of other players. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Initial Consideration**: 
   - Defecting in early rounds can exploit potential cooperation from others, leading to higher immediate payoffs.
   - However, defecting too much can lead to rapid resource depletion, reducing future payoffs.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation**:
   - Observe the behavior of other players over previous rounds to predict their likely choices in subsequent rounds.
   - If many players start defecting heavily, leading to rapid stock depletion, it becomes beneficial to switch to cooperating to preserve the resource for future exploitation.

3. **Impact on Future Payoffs**:
   - Defecting in early rounds maximizes immediate payoffs but risks depleting the resource too quickly.
   - Cooperating helps preserve the resource, allowing for continued exploitation in future rounds.

4. **Decision-Making Process**:
   - In each round after the first, estimate others' likely choices based on past behavior.
   - Calculate expected payoffs for both defecting and cooperating, considering their impact on future rounds.
   - Choose the action that maximizes total expected payoff over the remaining rounds.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Start by defecting in early rounds to exploit potential cooperation.
   - Monitor others' behavior and resource levels; if excessive depletion is threatened, switch to cooperating to preserve the resource for longer-term exploitation.

### Final Answer
The optimal strategy is to defect initially when others are likely to cooperate and adapt your behavior based on observed cooperation and resource levels. Thus, the AI should initially defect but adjust its strategy as needed to prevent excessive resource depletion.

\boxed{\text{Defect initially; adapt based on cooperation and resource levels}}

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff through strategic exploitation of other players' behaviors while balancing stock sustainability.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Maintain a high initial stock level to encourage others and promote long-term sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-5):**
   - Calculate the cooperation rate of other players over the last three rounds.
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to the capacity.
   
   a. If the cooperation rate is high (>60%) and the stock level is above 40% of capacity:
      - **Action:** Defect (D)
        - Rationale: Exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate payoff without risking stock collapse.

   b. If the cooperation rate is low (<40%) or the stock level is below 40% of capacity:
      - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
        - Rationale: Preserve the stock to prevent collapse and encourage future cooperation from others.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 5% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Maximize payoff with no concern for future consequences as the game is nearing its end.

---

### **Adaptation and Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Initial Cooperation Rate Adjustment:** Assume a high initial cooperation rate to encourage sustainability.
- **Moving Average Calculation:** Use an average of past three rounds' cooperation rates for stability in decision-making.
- **Stock Level Thresholds:** 
  - High threshold (60% capacity): Safe to exploit without causing collapse.
  - Low threshold (40% capacity): Critical level where cooperation is necessary to prevent stock depletion.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, n, r, capacity, current_stock, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate average cooperation rate of others over the last three rounds
    recent_history = history[-3:]
    cooperation_count = sum([sum(action == 'C' for action in actions) for actions in recent_history])
    cooperation_rate = (cooperation_count / (len(recent_history) * n)) if len(recent_history) > 0 else 1.0
    
    # Determine stock thresholds
    low_threshold = capacity * 0.4
    high_threshold = capacity * 0.6
    
    if round_number >= r - 5:  # Last few rounds
        return 'D'
    
    if cooperation_rate > 0.6 and current_stock > high_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# Example usage:
history = [all players' actions from previous rounds]
for t in range(1, r+1):
    action = decide_action(t, n=4, r=r, capacity=100, current_stock=S, history)
    # Record action and update stock
```

---

### **Conclusion:**

This strategy adaptively balances exploitation with sustainability. By defecting when others cooperate and preserving the stock when necessary, it maximizes individual payoff while mitigating risks of stock collapse. The approach is robust to varying opponent behaviors and effectively handles edge cases such as initial rounds and final game stages.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_19 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a repeated game scenario, where players can choose to cooperate or defect, we propose an adaptive strategy. This strategy considers both opponents' behaviors and the current state of the shared resource.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase:**
   - Cooperate for the first 2-3 rounds to observe opponents' behaviors and establish a baseline understanding of how the stock changes with different actions.

2. **Adaptive Defection Based on Opponents:**
   - After the initial phase, assess the number of defectors in recent rounds (e.g., the last 5 rounds).
     - If fewer than 30% of players defected, defect this round to exploit their cooperation.
     - If more than 50% of players defected, switch back to cooperate to preserve the resource and avoid mutual ruin.

3. **Stock-Level Thresholding:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity:
     - If above 80%, defect as it's safe due to strong growth potential.
     - Below 60%, cooperate to allow recovery and prevent further depletion.

4. **Final Rounds Handling:**
   - In the last 2-3 rounds, if the stock is high, defect for immediate gain since future payoffs are irrelevant.
   - If low, cooperate slightly to allow any possible recovery, though this may have minimal impact.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Continuously update thresholds based on recent stock responses and opponents' actions to adapt quickly to changes.

### Conclusion:

This strategy balances exploiting when safe against cooperating to sustain resources. It dynamically adjusts based on observed behaviors and resource levels, aiming for optimal long-term gains while adapting to changing conditions.

**Final Answer:**

The adaptive strategy combines initial cooperation with dynamic adjustments based on opponent behavior and resource levels. This approach ensures exploitation when safe and cooperation when necessary, balancing immediate gains against long-term sustainability. The final answer is:

$\boxed{\text{Adaptively defect when opponents cooperate and the stock is high; otherwise, cooperate to preserve resources.}}$

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' behaviors while maintaining resource sustainability to ensure long-term gains.

---

### **1. Initialization**
- Track each opponent's past actions (Cooperate: C, Defect: D).
- Define dynamic thresholds based on the initial stock capacity:
  - High threshold = 0.75 * capacity
  - Mid threshold = 0.5 * capacity
  - Low threshold = 0.25 * capacity

---

### **2. Round-by-Round Decision Making**

#### **Early Rounds (First 10% of Total Rounds):**
- **Action:** Tend to Defect.
- **Reasoning:** Test opponents' responses and exploit their potential Cooperation.

#### **General Play:**
1. **Observe Current Stock (S) and Opponents' Last Round Actions:**
   - Count the number of Cooperating opponents (`n_C_prev`).

2. **Decision Logic Based on Stock Level:**
   - **If S > High Threshold (0.75 * capacity):**
     - **Action:** Defect.
     - **Reasoning:** Exploit others' Cooperation while resource abundance allows it.

   - **Else If Mid < S ≤ High (0.5 < S ≤ 0.75 * capacity):**
     - **If `n_C_prev` > 70% of opponents Cooperated:**
       - **Action:** Defect.
       - **Reasoning:** Exploit the majority Cooperation to gain higher payoff.
     - **Else:**
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
       - **Reasoning:** Prevent further depletion by others' Defection.

   - **Else If Low < S ≤ Mid (0.25 < S ≤ 0.5 * capacity):**
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Reasoning:** Allow resource recovery to sustain future exploitation.

   - **Else (S ≤ Low Threshold):**
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Reasoning:** Critical stock level requires preservation for long-term gains.

3. **Consider Stock Trend:**
   - Track whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable over previous rounds.
   - If the stock has been decreasing, increase Cooperation to prevent collapse.

#### **Last Few Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
- **Action:** Defect if possible.
- **Reasoning:** No future payoffs after the game ends; maximize immediate gains.

### **3. Adaptive Adjustments**
- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust thresholds based on observed stock dynamics and opponent behaviors.
- **Opponent Modeling:** Update strategy based on opponents' historical cooperation rates to predict their future actions.

---

### **4. Edge Cases Handling**
- **First Round:** Default to Defect to test opponents' initial responses.
- **Stock at Capacity:** Start with a tendency to Defect, exploiting potential Cooperation.
- **Stock Near Zero:** Cooperate to allow recovery; prioritize long-term sustainability over immediate gain.

### **Pseudocode Outline**

```python
def strategy(round_number, stock, history):
    capacity = game_parameters['capacity']
    n_players = game_parameters['n']
    
    # Dynamic thresholds based on capacity

    # Consider stock trend
    # (Implement additional logic to track stock changes over rounds)

### **Conclusion**
This strategy balances immediate exploitation of opponents with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and opponent behaviors. By focusing on thresholds, historical data, and future implications, it aims to maximize individual payoff while mitigating the risk of resource collapse.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_21 = '''
To address the problem of devising an exploitative strategy in a resource harvesting game with perfect information about past actions and stock levels, we can outline the following step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initial Exploration Phase (First 20% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** By initially cooperating, observe other players' behavior and assess how they interact with the resource. This phase helps in understanding if others are defecting or cooperating.

2. **Middle Exploitation Phase:**
   - **Threshold Determination:** Set a dynamic threshold based on the logistic growth model and observed consumption patterns. For example, if the current stock is above 70% of capacity, it may be safe to exploit by defecting without causing immediate resource depletion.
   - **Action:** 
     - If the stock level is above the determined threshold: Defect.
     - If the stock level is below the threshold: Cooperate to aid in replenishing the resource for future exploitation.

3. **Late-Game Maximization Phase (Last 20% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect as much as possible.
   - **Rationale:** Since there are no future rounds left, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff without concern for long-term sustainability.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level and the proportion of defectors in previous rounds. Adjust the threshold dynamically based on whether the resource is being depleted too quickly or if cooperation is necessary to prevent collapse.

5. **Transition Between Phases:**
   - Smoothly transition between phases by adjusting actions based on observed trends and stock levels, ensuring that exploitation remains profitable while maintaining sustainable resource levels for future rounds when possible.

**Final Answer:**

The strategy involves initially cooperating to observe others' behavior, defecting when the resource is abundant to exploit it, switching to cooperation if depletion becomes significant, and maximizing defects in final rounds. This approach balances immediate gains with preserving resources for continued exploitation.

$\boxed{\text{Defect when profitable; cooperate to replenish; maximize late-game defects}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_22 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in resource management, we propose a strategic approach that adapts based on the current stock level and the number of remaining rounds. This strategy aims to exploit resources when they are abundant while conserving them as they dwindle or time runs out.

**Proposed Strategy:**

1. **Defect (D) if:**
   - The current stock \( S \) is above 60% of the capacity.
   - There are more than half of the total rounds remaining.

2. **Cooperate (C) otherwise.**

This strategy seeks to maximize immediate payoffs when resources are plentiful but switches to conservation as they become scarce or time approaches the end, ensuring a balance between exploitation and sustainability.

**Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the current stock is below 60% of capacity or there are fewer than half the total rounds remaining; otherwise defect.}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_23 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Action**: 
   - Defect (D) in the first round to exploit others' potential cooperation and maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Defection Threshold**: If the stock has increased compared to the previous round or if other players are cooperating significantly, continue defecting to exploit their cooperation.
   - **Cooperation Threshold**: Switch to cooperate (C) when the stock decreases significantly (e.g., by more than 10%) from one round to the next or when others are defecting too much, leading to low growth potential. This prevents resource collapse and allows for future exploitation.

3. **Final Rounds:**
   - Defect aggressively in the last few rounds since there's no future payoff to consider, maximizing immediate gains.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_history, opponent_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    elif round_number >= r - 2:  # Last few rounds
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Check stock trend
        current_stock = stock_history[-1]
        previous_stock = stock_history[-2] if len(stock_history) > 1 else capacity
        
        # Calculate change in stock
        stock_change = current_stock - previous_stock
        
        # Count cooperation among opponents
        coop_count = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions if action == 'C')
        
        # Dynamic thresholds based on stock and opponent behavior
        if (coop_count / n) > 0.5 or stock_change > 0:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

**Explanation:**
- **Initial Defection**: Starts by defecting to exploit others' potential cooperation.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Continuously assesses the stock's health and opponents' actions. If the stock is healthy or opponents are cooperating, defects to maximize personal gain. If the stock is threatened by excessive defection, cooperates to prevent collapse.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Maximizes gains in the last rounds without concern for future consequences.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with strategic cooperation to maintain resource levels, adapting dynamically to opponent behaviors and stock trends.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_24 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize personal payoff by exploiting opponents' strategies while maintaining sustainable resource levels.

**Strategy Overview:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Start with Cooperate (C) to encourage others to cooperate, fostering a higher stock level.
- **Observation and Adaptation:** Monitor the number of defectors. If fewer than half defect, exploit by defecting when the stock is high.
- **Balanced Exploitation:** When more players defect, switch to defecting only in rounds with high potential payoffs to avoid over-depletion.
- **Sustainability Check:** Cooperate if the stock is low to prevent further depletion.

**Detailed Strategy:**

1. **First Few Rounds (Early Game):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Encourage others to cooperate, keeping the stock high for growth and future exploitation opportunities.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Defectors:** Track the number of players defecting in each round.
     - If defectors < n/2:
         - **Action:** Defect (D) when the stock is above capacity/2 to maximize payoff while others cooperate.
         - **Rationale:** High stock levels ensure maximum growth, sustaining resources for future rounds.
     - Else:
         - **Action:** Cooperate (C) if stock is below capacity/2; otherwise, defect cautiously.
         - **Rationale:** Prevent excessive depletion by cooperating when the stock is low.

3. **Later Rounds:**
   - **Assess Stock Level:** If stock remains healthy (> capacity/2):
       - **Action:** Defect (D) when others are likely to cooperate, maximizing immediate payoff.
   - **If Stock is Low (< capacity/2):**
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
       - **Rationale:** Preserve the resource for potential future exploitation and prevent collapse.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Round:** Defect (D) if others are likely to cooperate, as there's no future round to exploit.
   - **Stock Collapse (Near 0):** Cooperate (C) to rebuild stock levels gradually.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = initial_capacity()

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Start with cooperation

    recent_defectors = count_defectors(history, last_n_rounds=5)
    threshold = n / 2

    if round_number <= 3:  # Early rounds
        return 'C'
    
    if stock_level > capacity * 0.75:
        if recent_defectors < threshold:

        if recent_defectors < threshold and random.random() < 0.7:
            return 'D'  # Partial exploitation
        else:
            return 'C'
    else:  # Stock is low, prioritize sustainability
        return 'C'

def count_defectors(history, last_n_rounds):
    total_defectors = 0
    for round_data in history[-last_n_rounds:]:

**Conclusion:**
This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to opponents' behaviors while maximizing personal payoff. By exploiting when others cooperate and defecting cautiously, it ensures long-term resource management and high returns.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_25 = '''
To address the problem of creating an AI strategy that balances exploitation with preventing resource collapse in a repeated game scenario, we've developed a structured approach. The strategy is designed to adaptively exploit when beneficial while conserving resources when necessary, based on observed stock levels and opponents' behavior.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Play Cooperate for the first three rounds to gather data on opponents' strategies and observe how the resource base changes.

2. **Adaptive Exploitation:**
   - From round 4 onwards, dynamically decide between Cooperating or Defecting based on:
     - Current stock level relative to a high threshold (80% of maximum).
     - Opponents' recent Defection rate.
     - Significant drops in stock from the previous round.

3. **Endgame Adjustment:**
   - In the last few rounds, prioritize immediate gains by increasing the tendency to Defect, as future consequences are less impactful.

### Detailed Strategy Steps:

1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1-3):**
   - Play Cooperate consistently to observe opponents' behavior and establish baseline stock dynamics.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **Assess Current Stock (S_t):**
      - Calculate the current stock level relative to the maximum capacity.
   
   b. **Evaluate Opponents' Defection Rate:**
      - Determine the average Defection rate among opponents over the last few rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).

   c. **Check for Significant Stock Drop:**
      - If the stock decreased by more than 20% in the previous round, switch to Cooperate to prevent further depletion.

   d. **Decision Making:**
      i. If S_t > 80% of capacity and opponents' Defection rate < 40%, play Defect.
      ii. Otherwise, play Cooperate.

3. **Endgame Adjustment (Last 5 Rounds):**
   - Increase the likelihood of Defecting to maximize immediate payoff, overriding previous conditions slightly.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Allows the AI to gather essential data without prematurely exploiting, which could lead to rapid resource depletion.
  
- **Adaptive Exploitation:** Balances between taking advantage of others' Cooperations and conserving resources when necessary. The thresholds (80% stock, 40% Defection rate) are chosen to allow exploitation while maintaining sustainability.

- **Endgame Adjustment:** Recognizes that near the end of the game, future rounds have less impact, so prioritizing immediate gains through Defecting is justified.

This strategy ensures a balance between short-term gains and long-term resource management, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and opponents' actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_26 = '''
To implement an effective exploitative strategy while considering the dynamics of stock replenishment and opponent behavior, follow this structured approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Exploitation Phase:**
   - **Action:** Defect in the first few rounds (e.g., 5 rounds) to maximize immediate payoffs.
   - **Purpose:** Gather data on opponents' reactions and establish a pattern of defection.

2. **Data Collection and Adaptation:**
   - **Opponent Tracking:** For each opponent, maintain a weighted moving average of their defection rate based on past actions.
   - **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously update your strategy using the latest data to predict opponent behavior accurately.

3. **Middle Rounds Strategy:**
   - **Defection Threshold:** Calculate the total expected consumption if you defect:
     \[
     \text{Total Consumption} = (\text{Expected Defectors} + 1) \times \frac{S}{n}
     \]
   - **Decision Criterion:** 
     - If Total Consumption ≤ 0.8 × Capacity, defect to exploit.
     - Else, cooperate to avoid over-consumption and prevent future stock exhaustion.

4. **Final Rounds Exploitation:**
   - **Action:** Defect in the last few rounds (e.g., last 3) to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future impacts.

5. **Stock Management Considerations:**
   - Monitor current stock levels and aim to keep S_remaining near capacity/2 after consumption to optimize growth.
   - Adjust defection rates if the stock is too low, balancing exploitation with sustainability for continued gains.

### Implementation Steps

- **Step 1:** Begin by defecting in the initial rounds to observe opponents' responses.
- **Step 2:** Track each opponent's defection rate using a moving average, giving more weight to recent actions.
- **Step 3:** For each subsequent round, estimate expected defectors and calculate total consumption if you defect.
- **Step 4:** Compare against the threshold (e.g., 0.8 × Capacity) to decide between defecting or cooperating.
- **Step 5:** In final rounds, prioritize defection to maximize payoffs.

### Example Decision Flow

1. **Round 1-5:**
   - Defect each round to gain data on opponents' behavior.

2. **Round 6:**
   - Calculate opponents' defection rates (e.g., Opponent A defected 70%, B 30%).
   - Estimate expected defectors: 2 out of 4.
   - Total Consumption if you defect: (2 + 1) × (S/4) = 3*(S/4).
   - If S=80, Capacity=100:
     \[
     Total Consumption = 60 ≤ 80 → Defect
     \]

3. **Round 15 (Mid-game):**
   - Opponents' defection rates: 50% each.
   - Expected defectors: 2.
   - S=70, Capacity=100:
     \[
     Total Consumption = (2 + 1) × (70/4) ≈ 52.5 ≤ 80 → Defect
     \]

4. **Round 20 (Near end):**
   - Regardless of stock, defect to maximize immediate payoffs.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponents' actions while maximizing personal gain.

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to maximize individual payoff while considering the dynamics of the game. The strategy should adapt based on players' past behavior and the current state of the common pool. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - If the stock is at its maximum capacity, cooperate to avoid over-depletion.
   - Otherwise, defect to gain more immediate payoff.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Monitor the cooperation rate of other players from the previous round.
   - Track the current stock level relative to capacity and its trend (increasing or decreasing).

3. **Decision Rules for Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If most players cooperated in the last round (cooperation rate > 50%) and the current stock is sufficient (e.g., above 30% of capacity), defect to exploit others' cooperation.
   - If the cooperation rate drops below a threshold (e.g., ≤50%), switch to cooperating to prevent further resource depletion.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - In the last round, choose actions based on maximizing immediate payoff since future rounds do not affect the outcome.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        if stock == capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        cooperation_rate = sum(history['actions'][-1] == 'C') / n
        if (cooperation_rate > 0.5) and (stock > 0.3 * capacity):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def strategy(round_number, stock, history):
    action = decide_action(round_number, stock, history)
    return action
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Round:** Starts with cooperation if the resource is abundant to avoid immediate over-depletion. Otherwise, defects for higher payoff.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** Exploits others' cooperation when possible by defecting but switches to cooperate if resource levels drop or others start defecting more, preventing long-term depletion.
- **Edge Cases:** Adjusts behavior in the last round to focus on maximizing immediate gains without concern for future rounds.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed player behavior and resource state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_28 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initialization**
   - Set a cooperation threshold (e.g., 50%) based on the proportion of defectors observed in previous rounds.
   - Define a stock depletion threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity) to determine when defecting becomes too risky.

2. **First Round Action**
   - Cooperate to observe opponents' initial moves without significantly impacting the resource pool.

3. **Subsequent Rounds (t = 2 to r-1)**
   - Analyze the previous round's data:
     a. Calculate the proportion of defectors.
     b. Check the current stock level against the depletion threshold.
   - Decision Rules:
     - If the proportion of defectors exceeds the threshold, cooperate to help maintain or replenish the resource for future rounds.
     - If the proportion is below the threshold, defect to exploit others' cooperation by taking more now.
     - Cooperate if the current stock is below the depletion threshold to avoid further depleting a critically low resource.

4. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds)**
   - Shift towards defecting more due to limited future impact, unless the stock is very low, in which case cooperate to prevent complete depletion.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**
   - If all players have been defecting and the stock is critically low, switch to cooperation to aid recovery.
   - Continue defecting if most are cooperating but the stock remains high, maximizing personal gain.

**Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, previous_round_data, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    cooperation_threshold = 0.5  # 50%
    depletion_threshold = 0.3 * capacity  # 30% of capacity

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    num_defectors_prev_round = sum(1 for action in previous_round_data if action == 'D')
    prop_defectors = num_defectors_prev_round / n
    current_stock_level = current_stock
    
    # Check if we're in the last few rounds
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        if current_stock_level < depletion_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D' if prop_defectors < cooperation_threshold else 'C'
    
    # For other rounds
    if current_stock_level < depletion_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif prop_defectors > cooperation_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Summary**

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability by adapting to opponents' behavior and monitoring the resource pool. It maximizes immediate gains while preserving future opportunities, ensuring robust performance against various opponent strategies in a repeated game setting.

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate
   - **Rationale**: Establish a baseline and observe others' behavior to gauge their strategies.

2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - **Condition**: If in the previous round, more than half of players Cooperated.
     - **Action**: Defect
     - **Rationale**: Exploit cooperation for higher immediate payoff while the stock can still sustain consumption.
   - **Condition**: If less than or equal to half Cooperated.
     - **Action**: Cooperate
     - **Rationale**: Maintain the stock and encourage others to continue Cooperating.

3. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 2 rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Defect
   - **Rationale**: Maximize immediate payoff without worrying about future rounds.

4. **Current Stock Consideration**:
   - **Condition**: If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity).
     - **Action**: Defect if others Cooperate, as the resource can handle more consumption.
   - **Condition**: If below this threshold.
     - **Action**: Cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow growth.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate due to lack of history.
   - **Last Round(s)**: Always Defect for maximum immediate payoff.
   - **Stock Near Capacity**: Defect if others Cooperate, as the stock can afford it.
   - **Low Stock Levels**: Cooperate to prevent collapse.

6. **Adaptive Considerations**:
   - Adjust strategy based on rounds remaining and current stock to balance exploitation with sustainability.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and exploitative, balancing immediate gains with long-term resource management while responding to others' behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_30 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts to opponent behaviors while maximizing individual payoffs, we outline the following approach:

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to observe opponents' initial moves and gauge their strategies.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the defect rate from previous rounds (number of defects / total actions).
   - If stock is high (>80% of capacity) and defect rate is low (<50%), Defect to exploit others' cooperation.
   - If defect rate is high (>70%), follow suit by Defecting to prevent being exploited.
   - When stock is low (<40%), always Defect to maximize immediate gains.
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 3), prioritize Defecting for higher payoffs.

### Strategy Implementation

The strategy dynamically adapts based on current stock levels, defect rates from previous rounds, and the number of remaining rounds. It exploits opponents' cooperative tendencies when possible while protecting against exploitation by others.

#### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    capacity = 100  # Example value; replace with actual game parameter
    r_total = 5      # Example total rounds; adjust as needed
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to observe others
    
    # Calculate defect rate from previous rounds
    total_prev_actions = sum(len(actions) for actions in history.values())
    if total_prev_actions == 0:
        defect_rate = 0.0
    else:
        prev_defects = sum(action == 'D' for actions in history.values() for action in actions)
        defect_rate = prev_defects / total_prev_actions
    
    # Determine thresholds based on stock and rounds remaining
    rounds_remaining = r_total - round_number + 1
    
    if rounds_remaining <= 3:  # Last few rounds, prioritize immediate gains
        return 'D'
    
    if stock_level > capacity * 0.8:
        if defect_rate < 0.5:
            return 'D'  # Exploit others' cooperation
        else:
            return 'C'  # Sustain resource as others are defecting
    elif stock_level < capacity * 0.4:
        return 'D'      # Grab remaining resources
    else:
        if defect_rate > 0.7:
            return 'D'  # Follow high-defect environment
        else:
            return 'C'  # Encourage sustainability
    
    # Default behavior (should not be reached)
    return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **First Round**: Cooperate to gather initial data on opponents.
- **Defect Rate Calculation**: Track how often players have Defected in previous rounds.
- **Stock Level Thresholds**: Adjust actions based on the current stock level relative to capacity.
  - High stock levels (>80%) with low defect rates encourage Exploitation by Defecting.
  - Low stock levels (<40%) trigger Defection to maximize immediate gains.
- **Endgame Strategy**: In the final rounds, prioritize Defection for higher payoffs.

This strategy balances exploitation of cooperative players with adaptability to changing conditions and opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_31 = '''
To address the problem, we developed a strategy that balances exploiting others when they Cooperate with preserving resources when others Defect heavily. Here's the organized approach:

### Approach
1. **Initial Rounds (Cooperate):** In the first 10% of rounds, Cooperate to set a baseline and observe opponents' behavior.
2. **Final Rounds (Defect):** In the last 10% of rounds, Defect to maximize immediate gains without concern for future depletion.
3. **Mid Game Strategy:**
   - **Monitor Consumption:** Track total consumption relative to current stock to infer opponents' actions.
   - **Adjust Based on Behavior and Stock Level:**
     - If opponents are Cooperating (low consumption), exploit by defecting if the stock is sufficiently high; otherwise, Cooperate.
     - If opponents are Defecting heavily (high consumption), Cooperate to prevent rapid depletion.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, n_players, current_stock, capacity):
    # Parameters
    early_rounds = 0.1 * total_rounds
    late_rounds = total_rounds - 0.1 * total_rounds
    m = 5  # Window size for recent rounds
    threshold_coop_consumption = 0.4  # Ct/S < threshold indicates Cooperators
    stock_threshold_high = 0.6 * capacity  # Stock is high enough to defect
    
    if round_number <= early_rounds:
        return 'Cooperate'
    elif round_number >= late_rounds:
        return 'Defect'
    else:
        # Calculate average consumption over past m rounds (hypothetical data)
        # For illustration, assume we have a list of past_consumptions
        past_consumptions = []  # This should be populated with actual data
        if len(past_consumptions) >= m:
            recent_consumptions = past_consumptions[-m:]
            average_c_ratio = sum([c / capacity for c in recent_consumptions]) / m
            if average_c_ratio < threshold_coop_consumption:
                if current_stock > stock_threshold_high:
                    return 'Defect'
                else:
                    return 'Cooperate'
            else:
                return 'Cooperate'
        else:
            # Not enough data yet; default to Cooperate
            return 'Cooperate'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts by Cooperating to gather information about opponents' behavior without risking immediate depletion.
- **End Game Exploitation:** In the final rounds, the focus shifts to maximizing gains by Defecting, as there's no future impact from resource depletion.
- **Mid Game Adaptation:**
  - By monitoring total consumption relative to stock capacity, the strategy infers whether opponents are Cooperating or Defecting.
  - When opponents Cooperate (low consumption), defecting is beneficial if resources are abundant. If resources are low, Cooperating helps preserve them for future exploitation.
  - When opponents heavily Defect (high consumption), Cooperating prevents further depletion and allows potential recovery of resources.

This strategy effectively balances immediate gains with sustainable resource management, ensuring long-term exploitation opportunities while mitigating mutual ruin scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_32 = '''
To determine whether to cooperate or defect in each round, the AI uses a strategy that balances immediate exploitation with preserving future opportunities based on the current stock level and the number of rounds remaining.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial and Final Rounds:**
   - Defect in the first round to maximize immediate payoff.
   - Defect in the last round since there are no subsequent rounds for preservation.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate a dynamic defect threshold that decreases as the game progresses. This ensures cautious exploitation later to preserve future stock.
   - The defect threshold is set to `defect_threshold = capacity * (1 - (t-1)/r)`, where `t` is the current round number and `r` is the total number of rounds.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - If the current stock exceeds the defect threshold, defect to exploit the higher stock.
   - If the current stock is below the threshold, cooperate to preserve the remaining stock for future exploitation.

**Answer:**

In each round:

- Defect if it's the first or last round.
- Otherwise, defect only if the current stock exceeds a dynamically decreasing threshold set at 80% of capacity in early rounds and lower as the game progresses. Cooperate otherwise.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when current stock is below } 0.8 \times \text{capacity; Defect otherwise}}$

description_EXPLOITATIVE_33 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by balancing exploitation of the resource with sustainable practices based on observed stock dynamics. Here's a structured plan:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Reason: Maintains high stock levels, allowing observation of others' strategies and ensuring initial sustainability.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Decision Rules:**
     - **Cooperate** if:
       - Current stock is below a dynamically adjusted threshold (initially set at 75% of capacity).
       - Stock trend indicates a decrease.
     - **Defect** otherwise, particularly when the stock remains high and shows growth.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Reason: No future rounds to consider, maximizing immediate payoff.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Monitor historical stock trends and growth rates.
   - Adjust the threshold based on observed replenishment efficiency; lower it if growth is sluggish.

**Implementation Strategy:**

- Track stock levels and consumption patterns each round.
- Use a moving average of stock health to determine thresholds dynamically.
- Prioritize exploitation (defect) when conditions permit, switching to cooperation when necessary to sustain resource levels for future rounds.

This approach ensures adaptability to various opponent behaviors while maximizing personal payoff through strategic exploitation.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents while maintaining sustainability through adaptive cooperation based on their behavior and the current state.

---

### **Decision Rules:**
1. **Early Rounds (t < r/2):**  
   - **Exploit Cooperators:** If opponents' Defection rate (D_rate) is low (<30%), defect to gain higher payoffs.
   - **Preserve Stock:** If D_rate is high (>60%), cooperate to prevent rapid stock depletion.

2. **Middle Rounds (r/2 ≤ t < r):**  
   - **Stock Threshold:**  
     - If stock > 75% capacity, exploit by defecting when possible.
     - If stock < 50% capacity, prioritize cooperation to allow recovery.
   - **Adjust Based on D_rate:** Continue exploiting if opponents cooperate but shift towards cooperation as D_rate increases.

3. **Late Rounds (t ≥ r/2):**  
   - **Final Round (t = r):** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff with no future consequences.
   - **Near End (r - t ≤ 5):** Shift focus to exploitation, defecting more if opponents are still cooperating.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round (t=1):** Cooperate to observe opponents' behavior and encourage initial cooperation.
- **Very Low Stock (S < 25% capacity):** Switch to full cooperation to prevent collapse and allow recovery.

### **Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, capacity, n, r, opponent_history):

            # Exploit if opponents are Cooperating moderately
            return 'D' if random.random() < 0.7 else 'C'

---

### **Explanation:**
- The strategy begins by cooperating to observe opponents.
- It exploits when opponents cooperate, especially early on, but shifts to cooperation if too many defect, preventing stock collapse.
- Near the end, it maximizes payoffs by defecting in the final rounds without worrying about future depletion.

This approach balances exploitation with preservation, adapting dynamically based on opponents' behavior and the game's state.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting the common pool resource while adapting to opponent behaviors and maintaining sustainable growth.

**Decision Rules:**
1. **Initial Exploitation (Early Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D) when the current stock is above a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
   - **Rationale:** High stock allows for significant immediate payoff without causing irreversible depletion.

2. **Monitor Stock Recovery:**
   - After each round, assess the stock's recovery rate.
   - Track whether the stock remains low or recovers adequately after consumption.

3. **Adaptive Cooperation (Later Rounds):**
   - If the stock consistently fails to recover significantly after defects:
     - **Action:** Switch to Cooperate (C) to allow regrowth and prevent total depletion.
     - **Rationale:** Sustaining a healthy stock ensures future payoffs, even if smaller per round.

4. **Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Dynamically adjust the defect threshold based on observed recovery trends.
   - Lower the threshold if opponents' actions lead to significant stock depletion.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Defect when possible due to high initial stock for maximum immediate payoff.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize final payoff without concern for future rounds.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = total_capacity
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # Initial threshold
    
    if current_round == 1:

    # Adjust threshold based on past recovery
    recent_recovery = calculate_stock_recovery(history)
    if recent_recovery < low_recovery_threshold:
        threshold *= 0.9  # Lower threshold to cooperate more
    
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return D  # Exploit when stock is sufficiently high
    else:

        previous_stock = round['stock_before_growth']
        recovery.append(growth / (previous_stock + growth))

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - Cooperate when the current stock is above 75% of capacity to encourage sustainable use.
   - Defect when the stock falls below 40% of capacity, exploiting the situation for immediate gain.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Start with Cooperate to observe opponents' responses and potentially encourage mutual cooperation.
   - **Last Round (if known)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
   - **Stock Near Capacity or Low**: Use dynamic thresholds (80% high, 40% low) to decide actions. If the stock is near capacity, Cooperate; if near depletion, consider defecting.

3. **Exploitative Mindset**:
   - Exploit opponents by defecting when they cooperate, especially in rounds following periods of high cooperation.
   - Monitor and adjust based on others' recent actions: if many are defecting, increase defection to prevent resource crash; if many Cooperate, defect to gain more.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments**:
   - Use thresholds dynamically adjusted based on capacity (e.g., 80% and 40%). If the stock is recovering, Cooperate; if depleting, consider Defecting.
   - Look for patterns in opponents' behavior: exploit consistent cooperators by defecting while cooperating with others trying to exploit.

**Pseudocode Strategy**:

```
function decide_action(current_stock, history):
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.4 * capacity

        else:
            return 'C'  # Maintain resource sustainability

description_EXPLOITATIVE_37 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting others with preserving the resource for future exploitation. The strategy should adapt dynamically based on opponents' actions and the current state of the stock.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first few rounds to assess other players' behavior.
2. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**: Determine a safe threshold for defecting based on the stock level, remaining rounds, and opponents' cooperation.
3. **Exploitation Based on Opponents' Behavior**: If others are cooperating and the stock is above the threshold, defect; otherwise, cooperate to preserve the resource.
4. **Adjustment in Later Rounds**: In the last few rounds, prioritize immediate gains by defecting more aggressively.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
function decide_action(stock, current_round, remaining_rounds, opponents_actions):
    if current_round <= initial_assessment_rounds:

    return adjusted_threshold

function calculate_opponents_cooperation(opponent_actions):
    # Calculate how often opponents have cooperated recently
    recent_coop_rate = sum([a == C for a in opponent_actions[-n_rounds:]]) / n_rounds
    return recent_coop_rate

# Edge Cases:
if current_round > r - final_exploitation_rounds:
    return D  # Defect in the last few rounds to maximize immediate gain
```

### Detailed Strategy Explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Few Rounds)**:
   - Cooperate to observe opponents' strategies and establish a baseline of cooperation.
   - This helps determine if others are following a cooperative or exploitative strategy.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**:
   - Calculate the maximum safe stock level for defecting, considering remaining rounds and expected consumption.
   - Use the logistic growth model to estimate how much the stock can recover after consumption.

3. **Exploitation Decision**:
   - If opponents are cooperating more than expected and the stock is above the threshold, defect to exploit the situation.
   - If many players defect, cooperate to prevent rapid depletion and allow future exploitation opportunities.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment**:
   - In the last few rounds, prioritize defecting to maximize immediate payoffs since there's no future benefit in preserving the stock.

This strategy adapts dynamically, exploiting when safe and cooperating to preserve resources for future exploitation. It balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adjusting based on opponents' behavior and the current state of the resource pool.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_38 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that maximizes individual payoffs while considering the sustainability of the common pool, follow these steps:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy begins with cooperation to maintain a high stock level. It then adapts based on the observed cooperation rates and current stock levels, exploiting others when possible without causing irreversible resource depletion.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to ensure a stable start.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If in the last 10% of rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - If more than half of players cooperated in the previous round and the stock is above 70% of capacity, defect.
   - If cooperation rate is low or stock is below 40% of capacity, cooperate to allow recovery.

### Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10%):** Defect to exploit remaining resources.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Safely Defect if cooperation rate is high.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate to prevent further depletion.

### Exploitative Mindset:
Exploit others' cooperation by defecting when the stock is sufficiently high. If too many defect, switch to cooperation to sustain the resource for future exploitation.

### Pseudocode Outline:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        prev_coop_rate = count_prev_C / n
        # Check if in the last 10% of rounds
        if round_number > total_rounds * 0.9:
            return 'D'
        # Exploit when others cooperate and stock is high
        elif prev_coop_rate > 0.5 and current_stock > capacity * 0.7:
            return 'D'
        # Cooperate to prevent collapse or if low cooperation
        elif prev_coop_rate < 0.3 or current_stock < capacity * 0.4:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Adjust based on others' actions
            if count_prev_D > n/2:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to maximize personal payoff while preventing catastrophic resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_39 = '''
The optimal strategy for balancing exploitation with sustainability involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the initial rounds to gather data on opponents' strategies and observe their behavior.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: Track the current stock level after each round. Use dynamic thresholds based on the remaining number of rounds and opponents' defect rates.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - Defect when the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) to maximize immediate gains while allowing growth to recover the resource.
   - Cooperate when the stock is below another threshold (e.g., 40% of capacity) to help regrow the resource and prevent collapse.

4. **Opponent Behavior Analysis**: Track how often each opponent defects or cooperates. Predict their future behavior and adjust your strategy accordingly, sometimes defecting when they cooperate and cooperating when they defect.

5. **Final Rounds Strategy**: In the last few rounds (e.g., the final 20%), maximize immediate payoff by defecting regardless of stock level, as there are no future rounds to consider.

6. **Randomness and Unpredictability**: Introduce slight randomness in decisions to avoid predictability and prevent opponents from exploiting your strategy.

By following this strategy, you can maximize your immediate gains while maintaining the resource's sustainability until the endgame, where maximizing payoff is more critical than long-term resource health.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when stock is low; defect when stock is high, adjusting based on opponent behavior and game progression}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_40 = '''
To address the problem, we have developed a strategic approach that balances between exploiting opportunities when others are defecting and maintaining cooperation for sustainable future gains. The strategy is designed to adapt based on previous rounds' cooperation rates and current stock levels.

### Approach
The strategy follows these decision rules:

1. **Initial Round**: Start by Cooperating.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round.
   - If more than 70% of players Cooperated, continue to Cooperate to sustain the resource.
   - If fewer than 30% of players Cooperated, Defect to exploit others' defecting behavior.
   - For intermediate cooperation rates (between 30% and 70%), use the current stock level as a tiebreaker:
     - If the stock is above 80% of capacity, Defect since growth is limited.
     - If the stock is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate to allow for better growth.
     - Otherwise, default to Cooperating or make a probabilistic choice (e.g., 50-50).
3. **Endgame**: In the last few rounds (last 10%), prioritize Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_cooperation(current_round, total_rounds, previous_actions, current_stock, capacity):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if current_round == 1:
        return True
    
    # Calculate the proportion of cooperations in the previous round
    prev_cooperate_count = sum(previous_actions[-1])
    cooperate_proportion = prev_cooperate_count / len(previous_actions[-1])
    
    # Check if it's near the end of the game
    if current_round > total_rounds * 0.9:
        return False
    
    # Decision rules based on previous cooperation and current stock
    if cooperate_proportion > 0.7:
        return True
    elif cooperate_proportion < 0.3:
        return False
    else:
        # Use current stock level as tiebreaker
        if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity:
            return False
        elif current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return True
        else:
            # Default to Cooperate or can make a probabilistic choice here
            return True
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round**: The strategy starts with Cooperation to encourage mutual sustainability.
- **Subsequent Rounds**: Based on the previous round's cooperation rates, the strategy adapts. High cooperation rates prompt continued Cooperation, while low rates trigger Defection. Intermediate rates use stock levels to decide, balancing between exploiting high stocks and sustaining growth in low stocks.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Recognizing diminishing future rounds' impact, the strategy shifts towards maximizing immediate gains through Defection.

This approach aims to optimize personal payoffs while considering the collective impact on resource sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior and current conditions.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round: Cooperate**
   - Start by Cooperating to observe opponents' behavior and gather initial data on their strategies.

2. **Subsequent Rounds: Adaptive Play**
   - **Estimate Opponents' Actions:** Use historical data to estimate how many players will Cooperate in the current round.
   - **Calculate Expected Consumption:**
     - If I Cooperate: Each Cooperator consumes stock/(2n), others Defect consume stock/n.
     - If I Defect: Adjust total consumption based on estimated Cooperators and my Defection.
   - **Evaluate Stock Impact:**
     - Compute remaining stock after consumption for both scenarios (Cooperate/Defect).
     - Calculate potential growth using the formula: Growth = 2 * S_remaining * (1 - S_remaining/capacity).
     - Check if remaining stock + growth is above a sustainable threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
   - **Decision Making:**
     - If Defecting keeps the stock above the threshold, choose D for higher payoff.
     - If Defecting risks dropping below the threshold, switch to Cooperate to prevent depletion.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **High Stock Levels:** When the stock is near capacity, defect freely as growth can sustain it.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to Cooperating to allow recovery and avoid collapse.
   - **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Adjust the threshold based on opponents' defection rates; more Defectors = lower threshold.

4. **Last Round: Always Defect**
   - In the final round, maximize immediate payoff by defecting without concern for future rounds.

**Summary of Strategy:**

- Begin with cooperation to gather information.
- Adapt decisions based on historical data and current stock levels.
- Exploit others' cooperation when safe, defecting for higher payoffs.
- Cooperate to prevent resource collapse when necessary.
- Defect in the last round for maximum gain.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by exploiting opponents' cooperative tendencies while safeguarding against resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_42 = '''
To address the problem of devising an exploitative strategy in a game-theoretic context where players can either cooperate or defect, we outline a structured approach that balances short-term gains with the need to sustain resources for future rounds. The strategy is designed to maximize immediate payoffs while preventing total depletion of the resource.

### Approach

1. **Initial Exploitation**: In the first round, the player defects to capitalize on potential cooperation from others.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision-Making**: For subsequent rounds, the player uses a threshold based on the current stock level relative to capacity and the recent defect rate among opponents.
3. **Preventive Cooperation**: If the stock falls below a critical threshold or if too many opponents are defecting, the player switches to cooperation to sustain the resource.
4. **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last round, the player defects again to maximize immediate payoff with no future consequences.

### Solution Code

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, num_players, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    """
    Decide whether to Cooperate or Defect based on current game state.
    
    Parameters:

        capacity (float): Maximum possible stock level.
        num_players (int): Number of players in the game.
        round_number (int): Current round number.
        total_rounds (int): Total number of rounds in the game.
        history (list): List of past actions taken by the player ('Cooperate' or 'Defect').
        
    Returns:
        str: The action to take, either 'Cooperate' or 'Defect'.
    """
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'Defect'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'Defect'
    else:
        threshold = 0.6 * capacity
        window_size = min(len(history), 5)
        recent_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-window_size:] if action == 'Defect') / window_size
        if current_stock > threshold and recent_defectors < 0.5:
            return 'Defect'
        else:
            return 'Cooperate'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Exploitation**: By defecting in the first round, the player aims to gain immediate benefits, assuming others might cooperate initially.
- **Threshold-Based Decision-Making**: The strategy uses a dynamic threshold (60% of capacity) and considers recent opponent behavior. If the stock is above this threshold and fewer than 50% of recent actions by opponents are defects, the player continues to defect.
- **Preventive Cooperation**: When the stock drops below the threshold or if too many opponents are defecting, switching to cooperation helps prevent further depletion, ensuring some resource remains for future rounds.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last round, defecting ensures maximum payoff without worrying about future consequences.

This approach balances short-term gains with strategic sustainability, aiming to maximize payoffs while preventing total resource collapse.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_43 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting others' behavior while maintaining enough stock for future exploitation. Here's a structured approach:

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning:** Starting with cooperation can encourage others to cooperate, allowing us to switch to defecting later when the benefits are higher.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Monitor the stock level and the number of players who cooperated in previous rounds.
   - If more than half of the players Cooperated last round and the stock is above 70% of capacity:
     - **Action:** Defect.
     - **Reasoning:** Exploit others' cooperation for higher payoff while ensuring enough stock remains for growth.
   - If fewer than half Cooperated or the stock is below 30% of capacity:
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Reasoning:** Prevent further depletion and allow stock regrowth.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Reasoning:** No future impact, so maximize current payoff even if it depletes the stock.

### Edge Cases:
- **First Round:**
  - Start with Cooperate to encourage others' cooperation.
- **Low Stock Levels (<30% capacity):**
  - Switch to Cooperate to allow regrowth and sustain future payoffs.
- **High Stock Levels (>70% capacity):**
  - Defect if others are cooperating, as the stock can recover.

### Pseudocode:
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, round_number):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = maximum_stock_level
    r = total_rounds

    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to encourage others
    if round_number <= 2:
        return 'C'

    # Check historical cooperation rate
    last_round_actions = history[-1]
    cooperators = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions if action == 'C')
    cooperation_rate = cooperators / n

    # Stock thresholds
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    high_threshold = 0.7 * capacity

    # Middle rounds: Balance exploitation and sustainability
    if current_stock > high_threshold and cooperation_rate > 0.5:
        return 'D'
    elif current_stock < low_threshold or cooperation_rate <= 0.5:
        return 'C'

    # Final rounds: Defect to maximize payoff
    if round_number >= r - 1:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy adaptively exploits others when beneficial, while ensuring the stock remains sustainable for continued exploitation in future rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_44 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we aim to maximize individual payoffs while adapting to the state and history of the game. The strategy balances immediate exploitation with sustainable resource management.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start by contributing to the common pool to encourage others to cooperate, allowing observation of their behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Until the Last Round):**
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If the current stock level is above 60% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect.
       - **Rationale:** Exploit the abundant resources by defecting, maximizing immediate payoff.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
       - **Rationale:** Preserve the resource to ensure future exploitation potential.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Rationale:

- **Exploitation When Abundant:** By defecting when the stock is above 60%, we take advantage of others' cooperation, maximizing our share while resources are plentiful.
  
- **Conservation When Scarce:** Cooperating when below 60% helps maintain resource levels for future exploitation, preventing rapid depletion.

- **Adaptation:** The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the observed stock level, making it robust against varying opponent behaviors without relying on specific knowledge of their strategies.

This approach ensures a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability, allowing for effective exploitation while preserving resources when necessary.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_45 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**

- **Initial Round (Round 1):**
  - Cooperate to observe opponents' behavior and avoid immediate stock depletion.

- **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
  - Monitor the proportion of Cooperators (C) in recent rounds.
    - If >60% of players Cooperate, Defect to exploit their actions for higher payoffs.
    - If ≤60% Cooperate or stock is below 30% of capacity, Cooperate to allow stock regrowth and prevent depletion.

- **Last 20% of Rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds if r=25):**
  - Increase Defection frequency to maximize immediate gains since future rounds are limited.

**2. Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate to gather initial data on opponents' strategies without risking rapid stock depletion.

- **Last Round (Round r):**
  - Defect to maximize personal payoff, as there's no future round to preserve the stock for.

**3. Exploitative Mindset**

- The strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs by exploiting others' cooperative tendencies while maintaining sustainability when necessary.
- Adjustments based on observed behavior and stock levels ensure adaptability to various opponent strategies and game dynamics.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Track opponents' actions and stock changes dynamically.
- Use thresholds (60% cooperation, 30% stock capacity) as indicators for switching between C and D.
- Adapt thresholds if necessary based on empirical performance in different game scenarios.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with sustainable play to optimize long-term payoffs while being robust against diverse opponent behaviors.

To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a balanced approach that maximizes immediate payoffs while preserving resources for future rounds. The strategy dynamically adjusts based on others' actions and the current stock level.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation with Conservation

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff and observe others' reactions.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If more than half of other players defected in the previous round, Cooperate to prevent rapid resource depletion.
  - If the current stock is below 40% of capacity, Cooperate to allow regrowth.
  - Otherwise, Defect to exploit others' cooperation.
- **Final Round:** Always Defect since future rounds do not exist.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Default to Defection for maximum immediate gain.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize final payoff without concern for future depletion.
- **Low Stock Situations:** Cooperate when the stock is low, even if others defect, to enable recovery.

**3. Exploitative Mindset:**
The strategy exploits cooperation by defecting when possible but switches to cooperation when necessary to prevent mutual resource depletion and ensure sustainable exploitation in future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python

    n = state.n
    capacity = state.capacity
    current_stock = state.stock
    
    threshold_defectors = n // 2

        if count_d_last_round > threshold_defectors or current_stock < low_stock_threshold:

### Explanation

- **Initial Round Exploitation:** By defecting initially, the strategy tests others' behavior while securing a higher immediate payoff.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** The strategy adapts based on others' actions and stock levels. It defects when others cooperate but switches to cooperation when too many defect or resources are low, preventing mutual depletion.
- **Final Round Maximization:** Defecting in the final round ensures no future impact is considered, securing the highest possible payoff.

This approach balances immediate gains with sustainable resource management, making it robust against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_47 = '''
To address the problem of devising an exploitative strategy for a game where players choose between Cooperating (C) or Defecting (D), we propose a strategy that adapts based on other players' behavior and the remaining rounds. The goal is to maximize one's own payoff while considering the impact on future rounds.

### Approach
1. **Initial Round:** Start with Cooperation to encourage others to also Cooperate.
2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Monitor the cooperation level of other players over recent rounds.
   - If a high percentage (e.g., 70%) of players are Cooperating, Defect to exploit their willingness.
   - If fewer than this threshold are Cooperating, continue Defecting as others aren't sustaining cooperation.
3. **Endgame Rounds:** In the last few rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate payoffs.

### Solution Code
```python
def exploitative_strategy(round_number, remaining_rounds, other_players_actions):
    # Parameters
    cooperation_threshold = 0.7  # 70% cooperation rate to consider exploiting
    endgame_threshold = 3        # Last 3 rounds are considered endgame
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif remaining_rounds <= endgame_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate average cooperation of other players in recent rounds (e.g., last 5)
        recent_rounds = min(5, len(other_players_actions))
        total_cooperations = sum(action == 'C' for actions in other_players_actions[-recent_rounds:] for action in actions)
        avg_cooperation = total_cooperations / (len(other_players_actions[0]) * recent_rounds) if recent_rounds > 0 else 0
        
        if avg_cooperation >= cooperation_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round:** By starting with Cooperation, the strategy aims to build a cooperative environment.
- **Middle Rounds Adaptation:** The strategy monitors the cooperation level of other players. If a high percentage of players Cooperate, it Defects to exploit their behavior. If cooperation is low, it continues to Defect to avoid being exploited by others.
- **Endgame Focus:** In the final few rounds, the strategy prioritizes maximizing immediate gains by always Defecting, as there's no future impact to consider.

This approach balances exploitation of cooperative players with adaptability based on observed behavior and remaining game duration.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_48 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 10% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Observe others' behavior and build initial stock growth without aggressive exploitation.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Track Cooperation Rate:** Monitor the cooperation rate among other players.
     - If most others are Cooperating (>50%) and the current stock (S) is above 60% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
       - **Rationale:** Exploit while the resource is abundant and maintained by others' cooperation.
     - If S drops below 40% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
       - **Rationale:** Help replenish the stock to prevent collapse.

3. **Last 10% of Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds, exploiting whatever remains.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - **Stock Recovery Check:** If in the last few exploitation rounds, S doesn't recover:
     - Temporarily switch to Cooperate (C) to allow growth.
   - **Adjust Thresholds:** Monitor stock growth patterns and adjust cooperation rate and stock level thresholds as needed.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C).
   - **Low Stock (S < 20% capacity):** Cooperate (C) to prevent collapse.
   - **All Players Defecting Previously:** Increase Cooperation (C) to attempt resource replenishment.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically based on others' actions and the current state of the common pool.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_49 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing payoff while balancing sustainable resource use, we consider the following key points:

1. **Immediate Payoff vs. Future Sustainability**: Defecting provides a higher immediate payoff, but it risks depleting the resource, which could lead to lower payoffs in future rounds.
2. **Threshold for Cooperation**: Cooperating is necessary when the current stock falls below a critical threshold (set around 30% of capacity) to allow recovery and ensure sustainable use in subsequent rounds.
3. **Final Round Strategy**: In the last round, always defect since there are no future rounds to consider.

Based on these considerations, the optimal strategy is:

- Defect in all rounds except when the current stock falls below 30% of its capacity, at which point you should cooperate to allow recovery.
- In the final round, always defect.

\boxed{\text{Defect in all rounds except when the current stock is below 30%, then Cooperate; Defect in the last round}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_50 = '''
To effectively manage the exploitation of a common resource while balancing immediate gains with sustainability, we employ a threshold-based strategy. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Define Thresholds**: Establish two thresholds, T1 (defection threshold) and T2 (cooperation threshold), where T1 > T2. For simplicity, set both at 50% of the resource capacity (c).

2. **Assess Current Stock**: Before each round, evaluate the current stock level (S).

3. **Decision Making**:
   - If S ≥ T1: Choose to defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - If S ≤ T2: Switch to cooperation to allow resource recovery.

4. **Adaptation**: Monitor the stock's response to your actions and adjust thresholds if necessary to prevent depletion or ensure sustainable use.

This strategy aims to exploit when resources are plentiful and conserve when they're scarce, promoting long-term sustainability while securing short-term benefits.

**Answer:**

To maximize individual payoff while considering resource sustainability, employ a threshold-based strategy where you defect when the current stock is above 50% of capacity and cooperate otherwise. This approach balances immediate gains with the need to preserve resources for future use.

The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Defect if the current stock is above 50% of capacity; otherwise, cooperate.}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_51 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for balancing immediate gains with resource sustainability, we can employ a threshold-based approach that adapts dynamically based on observed outcomes. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Threshold Setting**: Begin with an initial threshold \( T \) set as a high fraction of the total capacity, such as \( T = 0.7 \times \text{capacity} \). This encourages defecting when resources are abundant.

2. **Action Decision in Each Round**:
   - If the current stock \( S \) is greater than \( T \), choose to Defect (D), maximizing immediate payoff.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate (C) to help sustain the resource for future rounds.

3. **Post-Round Adjustment**:
   - After each round, calculate the total consumption and observe how the stock changes.
   - If defecting caused significant depletion (e.g., a drop exceeding a predetermined threshold), reduce \( T \) to encourage more cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - Conversely, if the resource remained stable or showed resilience, consider keeping or slightly increasing \( T \).

4. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Continuously adjust \( T \) based on the observed impact of defecting versus cooperating, balancing between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to initially defect when the stock exceeds a high threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) and adaptively lower this threshold if significant depletion occurs. This balance maximizes immediate payoffs while preserving resources for future rounds.

\boxed{\text{Defect when stock > 70% of capacity, else cooperate; adjust threshold based on depletion}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_52 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Defection**: 
   - In the first round, defect (D) to exploit others who may be cooperating, maximizing immediate payoff.

2. **Dynamic Stock Thresholds**:
   - Only defect when the stock level is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity). This ensures sufficient remaining stock for growth and future rounds.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to cooperation (C) to allow recovery and sustain higher payoffs.

3. **Monitor Defector Count**:
   - Track the number of players defecting in each round.
   - If more than half of the players are defecting, cooperate to prevent rapid depletion and collapse of the common pool.

4. **Last Round Exploitation**:
   - In the final round, defect (D) since there is no future impact, ensuring maximum immediate payoff.

5. **Stock Trend Analysis**:
   - Assess the trend of stock levels over time. If the stock is decreasing significantly despite some defection, prioritize cooperation to stabilize and recover the resource.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = game_capacity()
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # 75% of maximum sustainable stock
    
    if round_number == 1 or round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'  # Defect in first and last rounds
    
    num_defectors_prev = count(history[-1], action='D') if history else n//2
    average_stock = mean([h['stock'] for h in history]) if history else capacity
    
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return 'D'
    elif num_defectors_prev < (n / 2):
        # If less than half are defecting, exploit by defecting
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Cooperate to prevent stock collapse
        return 'C'

def count(actions, action='D'):
    return sum(1 for a in actions if a == action)

def mean(values):
    return sum(values) / len(values) if values else 0
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Defection**: Starts by defecting to exploit others' potential cooperation.
- **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: Only defects when the stock is sufficiently high, balancing exploitation with sustainability.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Monitors the number of defectors and adjusts actions accordingly. Switches to cooperation if too many are defecting, preventing resource collapse.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Ensures maximum payoff in the last round without concern for future impacts.

This strategy is designed to maximize personal gain while adapting to opponents' behaviors and maintaining enough resource sustainability for continued exploitation opportunities.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_53 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create a decision-making framework that adapts to other players' actions while maximizing long-term payoffs. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation with Cooperation Thresholds

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to encourage others and set a cooperative baseline.
2. **Monitor Opponents**: Track the percentage of Cooperators (C) and Defectors (D) in each round.
3. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - **Defect if Others Cooperate**: If more than 70% of players Cooperated last round, consider Defecting to exploit their cooperation.
   - **Cooperate if Exploited**: If a significant portion (e.g., >50%) Defected, switch to Cooperating to prevent further stock depletion and encourage others to follow.
4. **Stock Threshold Check**: Maintain the stock above 30% of capacity by prioritizing Cooperation to allow recovery through growth.
5. **Last Round Handling**: In the final round, defect if others are likely to do so, maximizing immediate gain.

### Detailed Strategy Breakdown

1. **First Round Decision**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - **Reasoning**: Sets a cooperative tone and observes opponents' initial moves without risking stock depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Step 1: Analyze Opponents' Previous Actions**
     - Calculate the percentage of players who Cooperated in the last round.
   - **Step 2: Decision Based on Cooperation Level**
     - If Cooperators > 70%: Defect (D) to exploit their cooperation, increasing immediate payoff.
     - If Cooperators ≤ 70% and Defectors > 50%: Cooperate (C) to preserve the stock and encourage others to do the same.
   - **Step 3: Stock Level Adjustment**
     - Check if the current stock is below 30% of capacity.
     - If Yes: Switch to Cooperating to allow growth and prevent collapse.

3. **Final Round Handling**:
   - **Action**: Defect (D)
   - **Reasoning**: Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future rounds, exploiting any remaining cooperation from others.

    if round_number == r:
        return 'D'  # Defect in the final round for maximum gain
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to encourage a sustainable approach, while also gathering information about opponents.
- **Exploitation When Possible**: Exploits when others cooperate excessively, maximizing personal gain without immediate harm to future payoffs.
- **Preservation When Necessary**: Switches to cooperation when the stock is low or when many are defecting, ensuring long-term sustainability and preventing resource collapse.
- **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, defects to maximize payoff, as there's no need for future cooperation.

This strategy balances exploitation with preservation, adapting dynamically based on opponents' actions and the current state of the common pool. It is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors while maximizing cumulative payoffs over the game rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_54 = '''
To address this problem, we need to develop a strategy that maximizes immediate payoffs while ensuring sustainable resource use. The approach involves balancing exploitation with conservation based on the current state of the resource (stock) and the actions of other players.

### Approach
1. **Immediate Exploitation in Final Rounds**: In the last few rounds, defect (D) to maximize immediate gains since future payoffs are no longer a concern.
2. **High Stock Threshold (T1)**: If the current stock is above T1, defect because there's sufficient resource to allow for regrowth after consumption.
3. **Low Stock Threshold (T2)**: If the current stock is below T2, cooperate (C) to prevent further depletion and ensure some resource remains for future rounds.
4. **Intermediate Stock Handling**: When the stock is between T1 and T2, assess the previous round's actions:
   - If fewer than half of the players defected, defect again to exploit their cooperation.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to avoid contributing to excessive depletion.

### Solution Code
```python
def get_action(history):
    n = history['n']
    capacity = history['capacity']
    current_stock = history['current_stock']
    round_number = history['round_number']
    total_rounds = history['total_rounds']

    # Calculate thresholds based on the current stock level
    T1 = 0.75 * capacity
    T2 = 0.5 * capacity

    # In the last 10% of rounds, defect to maximize immediate gain
    if round_number > 0.9 * total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    if current_stock >= T1:
        return 'D'
    elif current_stock < T2:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Look at the previous round's actions
        prev_actions = history['prev_actions']
        num_defectors_prev_round = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
        
        # If less than half of players defected last round, defect again to exploit
        if num_defectors_prev_round / n < 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Otherwise, cooperate to prevent further depletion
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Thresholds (T1 and T2)**: These thresholds help determine when it's safe or necessary to switch between exploiting (defecting) and conserving (cooperating). T1 is set at 75% of the capacity, and T2 at 50%, based on maximizing growth potential.
- **Last Few Rounds**: In the final 10% of rounds, defecting maximizes immediate gains without concern for future sustainability.
- **Intermediate Stock Handling**: By assessing previous actions, the strategy adapts to others' behaviors. If many cooperated last round, defecting is advantageous; otherwise, cooperating helps maintain resource levels.

This approach ensures a balance between maximizing payoffs and maintaining sustainable resource use, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and past interactions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_55 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The goal of this strategy is to maximize personal payoff while exploiting others' behaviors in the Common Pool Resource Game. The approach balances immediate gains with considerations for future sustainability, adapting dynamically based on the current state and history of play.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Rounds: Exploit with Caution**
   - **First Round:** Defect immediately as others may cooperate initially.
   - **Subsequent Early Rounds:** Continue defecting if possible, provided the stock remains above a safe threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity). This allows for higher immediate payoffs without risking collapse.

2. **Mid Game: Adapt Based on Opponent Behavior**
   - **Monitor Others' Actions:** Track cooperation and defection rates from previous rounds.
   - **Defect When Safe:** If the stock is above a threshold (e.g., 60%) and others are mostly cooperating, continue defecting to exploit their behavior.
   - **Cooperate if Necessary:** If the stock is low or a significant number of players are defecting, switch to cooperation to prevent rapid depletion. This ensures some growth for future rounds.

3. **Late Rounds: Maximize Immediate Payoff**
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20% of rounds):** Always defect to squeeze maximum payoff since there's no future beyond these rounds.

### Thresholds and Adjustments

- **Stock Threshold:** Set a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity) above which defecting is considered safe. Below this, consider cooperation to prevent collapse.
- **Opponent Behavior Adjustment:** If most players are cooperating, continue exploiting by defecting. If defectors increase beyond a certain point (e.g., more than half), consider switching to cooperation to ensure some stock remains for future rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round:** Start with defection to exploit potential cooperators.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Defect aggressively as future considerations are irrelevant, maximizing immediate gains.

### Strategy Implementation

1. **Current Stock Check:** Before each round, evaluate the current stock level relative to capacity and determine if defecting is safe.
2. **Opponent Behavior Analysis:** Track the number of cooperators and defectors in previous rounds to inform current decisions.
3. **Round Number Adjustment:** In early rounds, focus on exploitation; in late rounds, prioritize immediate payoff.

This strategy dynamically adapts to game state and opponent behavior, ensuring maximum personal gain while managing risks associated with resource depletion.

To maximize your immediate payoff while maintaining the resource's sustainability, you should defect whenever the current stock level is above half of the capacity and cooperate otherwise.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Factors:** The goal is to defect for higher payoffs but avoid over-depleting the resource so it can recover.
2. **Determine Threshold:** The optimal point for growth occurs when the remaining stock after consumption is around half of capacity, ensuring maximum recovery potential.
3. **Strategy Implementation:**
   - Defect if the current stock (S) is greater than or equal to 0.5 * capacity.
   - Cooperate otherwise to allow resource replenishment.

**Answer:**

You should defect when the current stock level is at least half of the capacity and cooperate otherwise. This strategy balances maximizing your immediate payoff with maintaining a sustainable resource level for future gains.

$\boxed{\text{Defect if current stock} \geq 50\% \times \text{capacity; else, Cooperate}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_57 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

The optimal exploitative strategy in the described scenario involves a combination of cooperation and defection based on the observed behavior of other players and the current state of the shared resource (stock). Here's a structured breakdown:

1. **First Round:** 
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Reasoning:** Starting with cooperation sets a baseline and may encourage other players to cooperate in subsequent rounds, creating an opportunity for exploitation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Except Last):**
   - **Observation:** Assess the number of cooperations by other players in the previous round.
   - **Decision Criteria:**
     - If more than half of the other players cooperated last round:
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - **Reasoning:** Exploit their cooperation to gain a higher immediate payoff while contributing less to resource depletion.
     - Else (if 50% or fewer cooperated):
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - **Reasoning:** Prevent the stock from collapsing too much, ensuring future opportunities for exploitation.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - **Reasoning:** Since there's no future round, defecting maximizes immediate personal gain without concern for long-term resource sustainability.

**Final Strategy:**

- In the first round, cooperate to encourage others' cooperation.
- In each subsequent round before the last:
  - If more than half of other players cooperated in the previous round, defect to exploit their cooperation.
  - Otherwise, cooperate to help maintain a sustainable stock level for future exploitation.
- In the final round, defect to maximize immediate gain.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with strategic cooperation to sustain resources for continued gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_58 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of total rounds):**
   - Cooperate to build up the stock and observe opponents' behavior. This helps in setting a cooperative baseline and allows time to assess others' strategies.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - After each round, calculate the previous round's total consumption.
   - Determine if this consumption was higher than what would be expected if everyone Cooperated (i.e., S_prev / 2).
     - If **previous_total > S_prev / 2**: Others are defecting. Cooperate this round to help recover the stock.
     - Else: Defect because others are cooperating, allowing exploitation for higher payoff.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - Defect every time since there's no future impact; maximize immediate payoff regardless of previous behavior.

**Decision Rule Summary:**

- Cooperate in the first 20% of rounds.
- For each subsequent round:
  - If the previous round's consumption was higher than S_prev / 2, cooperate to aid recovery.
  - Otherwise, defect to exploit others' cooperation.
- Defect in the last 10% of rounds.

This strategy balances exploiting cooperative opponents while conserving resources when necessary, aiming to maximize individual payoff without causing severe stock depletion.

### Strategy Overview
This exploitative strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while exploiting opponents' cooperation and adapting to the evolving game state. It balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adjusting behavior based on opponents' actions and the current stock level.

---

### Decision Rules
1. **Initial Rounds (First 3-5 Rounds):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline.
   - Observe opponents' actions in the first few rounds.
   - If more than half of opponents cooperate, defect in subsequent rounds to exploit their cooperation.
   - If most opponents defect, start cooperating to preserve the stock.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Calculate the proportion of opponents who cooperated in the last round (let’s call it `coop_rate`).
     - If `coop_rate > 0.7`, defect to exploit their willingness to cooperate.
     - If `0.3 < coop_rate ≤ 0.7`, defect if the current stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity). Otherwise, cooperate.
     - If `coop_rate ≤ 0.3`, cooperate to prevent rapid depletion.

3. **Final Rounds:**
   - In the last round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there’s no future payoff to consider.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Track opponents' cooperation rates over time.
   - If opponents switch between cooperation and defection, mirror their behavior with a delay (e.g., cooperate one round after they start cooperating).
   - If the stock is critically low (e.g., below 20% of capacity), always cooperate to allow regrowth.

        else:  # coop_rate <= 0.3
            return 'C'
```

---

### Exploitative Mindset
- **Exploit Cooperation:** If opponents are cooperating, defect to gain a larger share of the resource.
- **Prevent Tragedy of the Commons:** Cooperate when most opponents are defecting to prevent rapid stock depletion and ensure long-term sustainability.
- **Adapt Dynamically:** Adjust behavior based on current stock levels and opponents' recent actions to maximize payoff.

---

### Edge Cases
1. **First Round:**
   - Start with cooperation to observe opponents' initial behavior.
2. **Last Round:**
   - Always defect since there’s no future payoff to consider.
3. **Low Stock Levels:**
   - Cooperate to allow stock regrowth and prevent immediate depletion.

---

### Summary
This strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' cooperation while adapting to the evolving game state. It balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_62 = '''
To address the problem, we developed an exploitative strategy that balances immediate gains with considerations for resource sustainability. The strategy is designed to maximize payoff while monitoring the impact of actions on future rounds. Here's a concise breakdown:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Move**: Start by defecting in the first round to gain maximum immediate payoff.
2. **Adaptive Defection**:
   - If opponents cooperated in the previous round, defect again to exploit their cooperation.
   - If opponents defected, cooperate this round to prevent over-depletion and allow potential recovery.
3. **Stock Thresholds**: Always defect if the current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity) to extract remaining resources before they are exhausted.
4. **Endgame Focus**: As rounds progress toward the end, increase the tendency to defect to maximize immediate gains.

### Final Answer:
The optimal strategy combines exploiting opponents' cooperation with preserving resources when necessary. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **First Round**: Defect to gain maximum payoff immediately.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If most opponents cooperated last round, defect again to exploit their behavior.
   - If most opponents defected, cooperate this round to allow the resource to recover.
3. **Stock Monitoring**: Always defect if the current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity).
4. **Final Rounds Adjustment**: Increase defection in later rounds regardless of history to maximize extraction.

This strategy effectively balances immediate gains with considerations for future sustainability, aligning with an exploitative approach while managing resource depletion risks.

**Final Answer:**

To maximize your payoff exploitatively, you should defect initially and adapt based on opponents' behavior. Defect if opponents cooperated last round or if the stock is low; cooperate if they defected. Increase defection in later rounds. The strategy is:

1. Start by defecting.
2. If opponents mostly cooperated last round, defect again.
3. If opponents mostly defected, cooperate this round.
4. Always defect when the stock is below 30% capacity.
5. Defect more in later rounds.

The final answer is encapsulated as:

$\boxed{\text{Defect initially and adaptively; defect if opponents cooperated or stock is low; cooperate otherwise}}$

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing immediate payoffs while considering future sustainability. The strategy adapts based on current stock levels and recent player behavior.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round**: Defect to exploit the maximum initial resource availability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**: Adjust actions based on stock level and recent defection rates.
3. **Endgame Rounds**: Always defect in the last few rounds to maximize immediate gains.

### Decision Rules

- **First Round**: Always defect to capitalize on the full stock.
- **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r - end_threshold)**:
  - Monitor the current stock level as a percentage of capacity.
  - Track recent defection rates over the past `k` rounds.
  - If stock > 70% and recent defection rate < 40%, defect to exploit others' cooperation.
  - If stock is between 30-70%, adjust based on trends: defect if stock is stable or increasing, cooperate if decreasing.
  - Cooperate if stock < 30% to allow recovery unless near the endgame.
- **Endgame Rounds (Last `end_threshold` rounds)**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, recent_defectors, k=5, threshold1=0.7, threshold2=0.4, end_threshold=0.2):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'  # First round: defect
    
    if round_number >= (total_rounds - (end_threshold * total_rounds)):
        return 'D'  # Endgame: defect
    
    stock_percent = current_stock / capacity
    recent_defection_rate = sum(recent_defectors) / (k * len(recent_defectors[0]))
    
    if stock_percent > threshold1 and recent_defection_rate < threshold2:
        return 'D'  # Exploit cooperation when possible
    elif stock_percent < 0.3:  # Preserve resource for future exploitation
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Consider stock trend; additional logic can be added here
        return 'D' if current_stock >= previous_stock else 'C'

# Example usage
current_stock = 100  # Assuming capacity is 100, etc.
action = decide_action(current_stock, 100, round_number=2, total_rounds=10, recent_defectors=[[True]*4 for _ in range(5)])
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Round**: Start with defecting to maximize immediate payoff from a full stock.
- **Middle Rounds**: Use thresholds to decide between exploiting cooperation or preserving the resource. If others are cooperating and the stock is healthy, defect. If the stock is low, switch to cooperate to allow recovery.
- **Endgame Rounds**: In the final 20% of rounds, always defect to maximize payoffs without worrying about future sustainability.

This strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable exploitation by adapting based on observed behavior and resource levels, ensuring robust performance against various opponents.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_64 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Design a strategy that maximizes payoff by exploiting opponents while maintaining sustainable resource levels.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to observe opponents' initial moves and set a baseline for future decisions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Until Near End):**
   - Monitor the number of Cooperators (C_count) from previous rounds.
   - If C_count exceeds a threshold (e.g., more than half), Defect to exploit Cooperators.
   - If C_count is low, Cooperate to prevent stock collapse.

3. **Near End Rounds:**
   - Shift towards Cooperating in the last three rounds to maintain stock health and maximize payoffs.

### Decision Rules:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-3):**
  - If previous round's C_count > threshold, Defect.
  - Else, Cooperate.
- **Last Few Rounds (r-2, r-1, r):** Prefer Cooperating to ensure stock remains sufficient for high payoffs.

### Threshold and Adaptation:

- Threshold is set at more than half of players Cooperating in the previous round.
- Adjust based on observed behavior: If opponents frequently Defect, increase Cooperate frequency to sustain stock.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(history):
    if history.shape[1] == 0:
        return 'C'  # First round: Cooperate
    
    prev_round = history[:, -1]
    n_players = len(prev_round)
    
    # Count Cooperators in previous round
    c_count = sum(1 for action in prev_round if action == 'C')
    
    current_round = history.shape[1] + 1
    total_rounds = r
    
    # Check if near the end of the game
    if current_round > (total_rounds - 3):
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to maintain stock health
    
    # Decision based on previous Cooperators count
    threshold = n_players / 2 + 1  # Adjust as needed
    if c_count > threshold:
        return 'D'  # Exploit by defecting
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent collapse

```

### Edge Cases and Considerations:

- **Stock Dynamics:** Monitor stock evolution; high consumption can lead to rapid depletion, necessitating a shift towards Cooperating.
- **Opponent Behavior:** Adapt based on observed patterns; if many defect, prioritize cooperation to sustain resource levels.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainable resource management, ensuring adaptability across various opponent behaviors and game dynamics.

To address the problem, we'll outline a strategy for an exploitative agent in a multi-round resource management game. The goal is to maximize personal gain while considering potential recovery of the resource if others cooperate.

### Approach
The approach involves setting a dynamic threshold that decreases over time. This allows defecting in early rounds when resources are abundant and transitioning to cooperation as resources dwindle, encouraging recovery for future exploitation. The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

    if current_stock > threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# Example usage:
current_stock = 100.0
capacity = 100.0
total_rounds = 5
for current_round in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    action = determine_action(current_stock, capacity, total_rounds, current_round)
    print(f"Round {current_round}: Action = {action}")
    # Simulate the next state based on action and others' actions (assumed cooperation from others if 'C')
    if action == 'D':
        consumed = 25.0
        remaining = max(current_stock - consumed, 0)
        growth = 2 * remaining * (1 - remaining / capacity) if remaining > 0 else 0.0
        current_stock = remaining + growth
    else:
        my_consumption = current_stock / (2 * 4)  # Assuming 4 players
        others_defect = 3 * (current_stock / 4)
        total_consumed = my_consumption + others_defect
        remaining = max(current_stock - total_consumed, 0)
        growth = 2 * remaining * (1 - remaining / capacity) if remaining > 0 else 0.0
        current_stock = remaining + growth
```

### Explanation
- **Dynamic Threshold:** The threshold starts at 80% of the resource capacity and linearly decreases to 20%. This encourages defecting in early rounds when resources are plentiful.
- **Last Round Defect:** Always defect in the last round since there's no future benefit from cooperation.
- **Immediate Gain vs. Recovery:** By defecting above the threshold, the agent maximizes immediate gain. Below the threshold, cooperation allows some resource recovery for potential future exploitation.

This strategy balances exploiting the resource with allowing recovery if others cooperate, optimizing personal gain over multiple rounds.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Decision:**
   - **Cooperate** if the initial stock is above 80% of capacity (i.e., `stock > 0.8 * capacity`). This helps maintain a sustainable resource level, allowing for future growth.
   - **Defect** otherwise, especially if the stock is low, to maximize immediate payoff since there's less risk of severe depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision:**
   - Calculate the average defection rate from previous rounds by observing how many players Defected in each round relative to total players (n).
     - `defection_rate = (number_of_defectors_in_previous_rounds) / (n * number_of_previous_rounds)`
   - If `defection_rate` is high (e.g., > 0.6), **Cooperate** to help preserve the stock, allowing it to regrow and sustain future payoffs.
   - If `defection_rate` is low (e.g., < 0.4), **Defect** to exploit others' cooperation, maximizing immediate gain without causing rapid depletion.

3. **Final Round Decision:**
   - Always **Defect** in the last round (`round = r`) since there's no future payoff to consider. This maximizes your payoff for that final round regardless of stock levels.

4. **Adaptive Payoff Expectation:**
   - Estimate the expected payoff from Cooperating vs Defecting based on current stock and others' actions.
     - `expected_cooperate_payoff = (current_stock) / (2n)`
     - `expected_defect_payoff = (current_stock) / n`
   - If `expected_defect_payoff` is significantly higher than `expected_cooperate_payoff`, Defect to exploit the situation. Otherwise, Cooperate to contribute to resource sustainability.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Use initial stock level to decide between Cooperate or Defect.
   - **Low Stock Scenario:** If current_stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), prioritize Cooperating to prevent collapse and enable growth for potential future rounds.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, stock, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()

    if current_round == 1:
        if stock > 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'

    # Calculate defection rate from history
    num_defectors = sum([round_actions.count('D') for round_actions in history])
    total_actions = len(history) * n
    defection_rate = num_defectors / total_actions

    # Determine action based on defection rate and current stock
    if defection_rate > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    elif defection_rate < 0.4:
        return 'D'

    # Calculate expected payoffs
    cooperate_payoff = stock / (2 * n)
    defect_payoff = stock / n

    if defect_payoff > cooperate_payoff:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy starts by assessing the initial resource level to decide whether to Cooperate or Defect, aiming for a sustainable approach when resources are ample.
- By tracking others' defection rates, the strategy adapts dynamically: Cooperating when others defect heavily to preserve resources and Defecting when others cooperate extensively to exploit immediate gains.
- In the final round, defecting maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
- The strategy balances between exploiting others and preserving resources, ensuring adaptability across different game dynamics.

To determine the optimal action for each round, follow these decision rules:

1. **First Round**: Always choose Defect (D).
2. **Last Round**: Always choose Defect (D).
3. **Middle Rounds**:
   - If more than half of the players Cooperated in the previous round, choose Defect (D) this round.
   - Otherwise, if the current stock is above 60% of capacity, choose Defect (D); otherwise, choose Cooperate (C).

This strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable exploitation.

**Answer:**

For each round, the AI chooses to defect in the first and last rounds. In middle rounds, it defects if more than half of players cooperated previously or if the stock is above 60% capacity; else, it cooperates.

\boxed{D} \text{ in first and last rounds; } D \text{ when previous cooperation exceeds defection or stock > 60%; else } C.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_68 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds**: Start by defecting in the first few rounds to test others' behavior and gain immediate payoffs.

2. **Analyze Opponents**: Track the history of other players' actions to determine if they are mostly defecting or cooperating. Focus on a moving window (e.g., last 3 rounds) to assess recent trends.

3. **Defect Dominance**: If more than half of the players have been defecting in recent rounds, continue defecting as it aligns with others' behavior and yields higher immediate payoffs.

4. **Cooperation Exploitation**: If a significant number of players are still cooperating, exploit this by defecting to maximize personal gain while they sustain the resource.

5. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - Monitor the current stock level. If it drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to cooperation temporarily to allow some regrowth before exploiting again.
   - Avoid defecting when the stock is very low if growth potential is negligible, as this prevents future exploitation.

6. **Last Round Defect**: Always defect in the final round since there's no future punishment for depleting the resource.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
Initialize:
    history = []  # Track others' actions and stock levels over time
    defect_threshold = 0.6  # If >60% of others are defecting
    low_stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity  # Stock level below which to cooperate

For each round t in 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = D
    else:
        # Calculate defect rate among other players from history
        recent_rounds = min(3, len(history))
        past_actions = [a for a in history[-recent_rounds:]]
        defect_rate = sum(a == 'D' for a in past_actions) / len(past_actions)
        
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        
        if t == r:
            action = D
        elif current_stock < low_stock_threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            if defect_rate > defect_threshold:
                action = D
            else:
                # Exploit cooperation by defecting
                action = D
                
    # Update history with this round's action and stock level
    history.append(action)
```

**Rationale:**
- **Immediate Payoff Focus**: Prioritizes higher payoffs from defecting, especially when others cooperate.
- **Adaptability**: Adjusts based on recent opponent behavior and current stock levels to exploit opportunities while considering sustainability.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: Ensures optimal play in the first and last rounds, and manages low stock scenarios to balance exploitation with some preservation for future gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_69 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Encourage others to cooperate by setting a cooperative tone early on.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 50% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Cooperation Threshold (C):** If the current stock is below 60% of capacity, cooperate.
     - **Rationale:** Prevents excessive depletion and aids in resource replenishment.
   - **Defection Threshold (D):** If more than 70% of players cooperated in the previous round, defect.
     - **Rationale:** Exploit others' cooperative behavior to maximize personal payoff.
   - **Default Action:** If neither threshold is met, defect if it provides a higher immediate payoff without causing significant stock depletion; otherwise, cooperate.

3. **Last 25% of Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Shift towards defection to maximize payoffs in remaining rounds.
     - **Monitoring Stock Levels:** Avoid complete collapse by cautiously assessing the impact of each defection.

**Adjustments and Considerations:**

- Use moving averages for cooperation rates to smooth out fluctuations.
- Dynamically adjust thresholds based on observed trends in stock levels and others' behavior if necessary.
- Balance immediate payoff gains with long-term sustainability to avoid resource collapse.

This strategy aims to exploit cooperative behavior while safeguarding against severe resource depletion, ensuring both short-term gains and sustainable resource management.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_70 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing short-term gains while maintaining enough resources for continued exploitation. The strategy adapts based on the stock level and game progression.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Early Exploitation**: Begin by defecting to maximize immediate payoffs when the stock is high.
2. **Threshold-Based Switching**: Continue defecting as long as the stock remains above a set threshold. Once it drops below this threshold, switch to cooperation to prevent rapid depletion.
3. **Final Round Defection**: Always defect in the last round to maximize payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Decision Rules:

- **First Round**: Defect to exploit others' potential cooperation.
- **Middle Rounds**:
  - If the stock is above a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), defect.
  - If below the threshold, cooperate to allow resource growth and sustain future exploitation.
- **Last Round**: Defect regardless of the stock level.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, n, r):
    threshold = capacity * 0.75  # Adjust based on game parameters if needed
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Rationale:

- **Early Defection**: Exploits others' potential cooperation, yielding higher immediate payoffs.
- **Threshold Switching**: Maintains resource sustainability by switching to cooperation when the stock is low enough to prevent depletion.
- **Last Round Defection**: Maximizes payoff without regard for future rounds, as there are none.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, ensuring continued gains while adapting to changing conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_71 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting others while considering the sustainability of the resource. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy adapts based on the current stock level, opponents' actions, and the game's progression through rounds.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Build a baseline of resource preservation and observe opponents' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **If Stock is Above Threshold (e.g., 80% capacity):**
     - If most opponents are Cooperating, Defect to gain higher payoff.
     - If many are Defecting, switch to Cooperate to avoid rapid depletion.
   - **If Stock is Low (<50% capacity):**
     - Consider Cooperating to preserve what's left for future rounds.

3. **Endgame (Last 5 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Shift towards Defecting.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate gains as future rounds are limited.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:**
  - Default action: Cooperate to maintain resource levels and observe opponents.

- **Low Stock Levels:**
  - If stock is low, defect strategically but cautiously to avoid complete depletion.

- **Last Round:**
  - Definitely Defect to exploit the remaining resource for maximum payoff.

### Implementation Considerations:

- **Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold can be dynamically adjusted based on observed opponent behavior. For example, if more than 60% of players are defecting, increase your defection rate.
- **Sustainability Check:** Regularly assess stock growth and adjust actions to prevent unnecessary depletion.

### Example Scenario:
In a game with n=4, capacity=100:

- **Round 1:** Cooperate to observe others. If others Cooperate, start defecting in subsequent rounds.
- **Mid-game (e.g., Round 5):** Stock is at 80. Most players are Cooperating; Defect to gain higher payoff.
- **Endgame (Last 3 Rounds):** Shift to Defecting to maximize gains from the remaining resource.

This approach ensures that we exploit opportunities when others cooperate while preserving the resource when necessary, adapting dynamically based on game progression and opponent behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_72 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Begin by Cooperating (C) to encourage other players to also Cooperate, creating a cooperative environment.

2. **Mid-Game Exploitation:**
   - Starting from round 4 onwards:
     - If more than 50% of players Cooperated in the previous round, switch to Defecting (D) to exploit their cooperation.
     - Monitor the stock level; if it drops below a certain threshold (e.g., capacity/2), consider reducing defection frequency or Cooperating again to prevent rapid depletion.

3. **Stock Management:**
   - Maintain a balance between exploiting and preserving the resource. If stock levels indicate potential collapse, adjust strategy to preserve sustainability for continued exploitation in future rounds.

4. **Endgame Exploitation (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - In the final few rounds, Defect maximally (D) as there are no future consequences, maximizing immediate gains regardless of resource depletion.

**Decision Rules:**

- **Cooperate Initially:** Use C in the first 2-3 rounds to foster cooperation.
- **Exploit When Possible:** From round 4 onwards, if >50% of players Cooperated last round, switch to D.
- **Adjust for Sustainability:** If stock drops below capacity/2, reduce defection or Cooperate to maintain resource levels.
- **Maximize in Endgame:** Always Defect in the final 10% of rounds.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Start with C to encourage others to Cooperate.
- **Last Rounds:** Defect maximally as future rounds do not penalize for over-consumption.

This strategy adaptively balances exploitation and resource management, ensuring maximum personal gain while adapting to opponent behaviors and stock dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_73 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing our own payoff while adapting to the game's dynamics and other players' behaviors. The strategy is structured as follows:

### Strategy Overview

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start by allowing stock growth.
2. **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
3. **Middle Rounds**: Adapt based on the stock's recent trend:
   - **Defect** if the stock is increasing or stable, exploiting others' cooperation.
   - **Cooperate** if the stock is decreasing, preserving resources for future exploitation.

### Detailed Strategy

1. **Initial Round (Round 1)**: Cooperate to maintain a high stock level, enabling growth and setting a baseline for sustainability.

2. **Final Round (Round r)**: Defect to secure maximum immediate payoff since there are no future rounds for retaliation or reward.

3. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Check Stock Trend**: Compare the stock levels from the previous two rounds.
     - If the stock is increasing or stable, defect to exploit others' cooperation and gain higher immediate payoff.
     - If the stock is decreasing, cooperate to help sustain it for future rounds.

### Rationale

- **Cooperate in First Round**: Starts with a positive action that supports sustainability, encouraging growth and setting up potential future gains.
  
- **Defect in Last Round**: Classic exploitative move in a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma scenario, maximizing immediate payoff without concern for long-term effects.

- **Middle Rounds Adaptation**:
  - **Stock Stability/Increase**: Indicates the resource is sustainable, allowing defecting to gain more without causing immediate harm.
  - **Stock Decrease**: Shows vulnerability; cooperating helps prevent further depletion, ensuring future exploitability.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to observed trends and exploiting others' behaviors effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_74 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy balances between cooperation for sustainability in the early rounds and defection when advantageous or necessary, particularly as the game progresses towards its conclusion.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Reasoning:** Establish a base of cooperation to maintain the resource and allow others to contribute to its preservation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **If Stock > 75% of Capacity:**
     - **Action:** Cooperate
     - **Reasoning:** Maintain the resource for future rounds by contributing to sustainable consumption.
   
   - **If Stock < 25% of Capacity:**
     - **Action:** Defect
     - **Reasoning:** The resource is already depleted; maximize immediate gain since future benefits are limited.

   - **If Stock Between 25% and 75% of Capacity:**
     - **Calculate Cooperation Rate:** Determine the proportion of players who cooperated in the last round.
     - **Threshold for Cooperation:** If more than half (≥50%) of players cooperated, cooperate; otherwise, defect.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Reasoning:** Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock, history):
    capacity = 100  # Replace with actual game parameter if available
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(history)
        
        if stock > 0.75 * capacity:
            return "Cooperate"
        elif stock < 0.25 * capacity:
            return "Defect"
        else:
            if cooperation_rate >= 0.5:
                return "Cooperate"
            else:
                return "Defect"

def calculate_cooperation_rate(history):
    # Calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in the last round
    last_round_actions = history[-1] if history else []
    num_cooperators = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions if action == "Cooperate")
    return num_cooperators / len(last_round_actions)
```

### Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to encourage resource preservation.
- **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff with no future considerations.
- **High Stock (Near Capacity):** Cooperate to maintain sustainability for future rounds.
- **Low Stock (Near Zero):** Defect as the resource is depleted, maximizing current gains.

This strategy adapts dynamically based on the game's state and opponents' behaviors, balancing cooperation for long-term benefits with defection for immediate gains when advantageous.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_75 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy is designed to maximize payoffs in a dynamic, repeated game where players must balance short-term gains against long-term sustainability. The approach leverages adaptive decision-making based on current stock levels and opponents' actions.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Rounds (High Stock):**
   - Defect when the stock is above a predefined threshold to exploit high payoffs.
   - Example: If the stock is above 70% of capacity, defect to gain higher immediate rewards.

2. **Mid-Game Adaptation:**
   - Monitor opponents' actions. Track the proportion of defects in each round.
   - If more than half of players are defecting, switch to a cooperative strategy to preserve the resource for future rounds.
   - Adjust the threshold dynamically based on observed defection rates and stock recovery.

3. **Late Rounds (Approaching Endgame):**
   - In the last few rounds, prioritize immediate gains by defecting if possible.
   - If the stock is low, cooperate to allow minimal recovery without sacrificing too much in the final rounds.

### Threshold-Based Decision Making:
- Use a threshold to decide between Cooperate (C) and Defect (D). Start with an initial threshold of 70% of capacity.
- Adjust this threshold based on past outcomes: increase it if cooperation is observed, decrease if defection rates are high.

### Punishing Opponents:
- If opponents defect excessively, reduce your own defection rate to penalize them by lowering their potential payoffs in future rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** With maximum stock, defect to gain higher immediate rewards.
- **Last Round:** Defect if the stock is above a certain level; otherwise, cooperate to ensure some recovery.

### Pseudocode Outline:
```python
def strategy(history, current_round, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = initial_stock
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity  # Initial threshold
    defect_count = sum(player_defected in history for player_defected)

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'D'  # Defect on first round with high stock

    if defect_count > n / 2:
        # Adjust threshold based on high defection
        threshold *= 0.9
        if current_stock < threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

    if current_round == total_rounds - 1 or current_round == total_rounds:
        # Late rounds: prioritize immediate gains
        if current_stock > threshold * 0.8:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

    # Dynamic adjustment based on past outcomes
    if stock_growth_prev_round < average_growth:
        threshold *= 1.1

    return decision
```

### Summary:
This strategy adaptively balances exploitation and preservation, dynamically adjusting decisions based on current stock levels and opponents' actions. It aims to maximize payoffs while remaining robust to various opponent behaviors, ensuring sustainability where beneficial without relying on cooperation or coordination.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_76 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set thresholds based on the capacity:
     - `stock_high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity`
     - `stock_low_threshold = 0.5 * capacity`
     - `cooperation_trigger = 0.3` (opponent defect rate)
   - Start with cooperation in the first round.

2. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to observe opponents' initial moves.
   - **Subsequent Rounds (not last):**
     - Calculate the proportion of opponents who Defected (`opponent_d_rate`) in the previous round.
     - Check current stock level (`current_stock`).
     - **If `opponent_d_rate > cooperation_trigger`:** Defect to exploit others' potential cooperation or join in defecting if many are doing so.
     - **Else If `current_stock < stock_low_threshold`:** Defect as the resource is already depleted; maximize immediate gain.

     - **Otherwise:** Cooperate, but consider occasional defecting to test opponents' responses.
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

3. **Adaptation:**
   - Adjust thresholds if necessary based on observed game dynamics and opponent strategies over time.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' behavior while ensuring robustness across various scenarios.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - *Reasoning:* Maintaining a higher stock promotes sustainable growth, which benefits all players in the short term. This phase allows observation of opponents' strategies.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 60% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Adaptive based on opponents' history.
     - Track each opponent's cooperation rate:
       - If ≥70% Cooperate, respond with Defect (D) to exploit their tendency to sustain the resource.
       - If <70% Cooperate, mimic their behavior: if they defect, defect; if they cooperate, cooperate.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - *Reasoning:* The stock's future impact is minimal, so prioritize immediate payoff by defecting to maximize personal gain.

---

### **Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate (C) to observe the initial dynamics and encourage a stable environment.

- **Last Few Rounds:**
  - Transition to Defect (D) to capitalize on any remaining stock without concern for future rounds.

- **Stock Thresholds:**
  - If stock is near capacity (above 80% of capacity):
    - Cooperate (C) to sustain growth.
  - If stock is low (below 20% of capacity):
    - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff as the resource is already strained.

---

### **Exploitative Mindset**

- **Free-Riding:**
  - When opponents cooperate, defect to gain a higher share of the resource while contributing less to its depletion.

- **Punishing Defectors:**
  - If opponents defect, respond by defecting even more aggressively in subsequent rounds. This strategy aims to deplete the stock further, forcing other players into lower payoffs.

- **Adaptation:**
  - Continuously update decisions based on opponents' historical actions. Adjust cooperation rates dynamically to exploit patterns without relying on coordination or prior agreements.

---

### **Dynamic Adaptation**

1. **Track Opponents' History:**
   - Maintain a record of each opponent's past actions (Cooperate/Defect) to predict future behavior.

2. **Adjust Based on Cooperation Rates:**
   - If an opponent cooperates frequently, exploit by defecting.
   - If an opponent defects frequently, mirror their strategy to maximize immediate gains.

3. **Balance Exploitation and Sustainability:**
   - Monitor the stock level to avoid depleting it too quickly. Transition strategies based on whether the stock is growing or shrinking.

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

def decide_action(opponent_histories, current_stock, round_number):
    n = number_of_players()

### **Summary**

This strategy balances exploitation with adaptability, ensuring maximum payoff while responding to opponents' behaviors. It starts cooperatively, adapts based on observations, and transitions to defecting in the final rounds to capitalize on remaining resources. The approach is robust to various opponent strategies and ensures long-term sustainability without relying on cooperation or coordination.

   - **Threshold:** Set a cooperation threshold (initially at 60%).
     - If OCR > threshold AND SH > safe_level:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
       - **Reasoning:** Exploit opponents while ensuring the resource remains sustainable.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
       - **Reasoning:** Preserve the stock to prevent future collapse.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Reasoning:** No future rounds; maximize immediate payoff without concern for resource sustainability.

---

### **Dynamic Adjustments:**

- **Adjust Threshold Based on Stock Trends:**
  - If stock consistently increases or remains stable, slightly lower the OCR threshold to encourage more exploitation.
  - If stock decreases significantly, raise the OCR threshold to promote Cooperation and prevent further depletion.

- **Use Weighted Averages:**
  - Prioritize recent rounds when calculating OCR to adapt quickly to changes in opponents' behavior.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate (C) to observe opponents without risking exploitation early.

2. **Low Stock Levels:**
   - If stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), prioritize Cooperation to aid regrowth, regardless of OCR.

3. **Unexpected Behavior:**
   - If opponents suddenly switch strategies (e.g., all Defect), adjust by Cooperating in subsequent rounds to prevent resource collapse.

---

### **Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, opponent_actions, capacity):
    n = number_of_players()
    safe_stock_ratio = 0.5 * capacity
    cooperation_threshold = 0.6
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate opponents' cooperation rate in previous rounds
        opponent_coop_rate = sum(opponent_actions) / len(opponent_actions)
        
        # Check stock health
        if stock_level > safe_stock_ratio and opponent_coop_rate > cooperation_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    # Dynamically adjust threshold based on stock trends (optional advanced step)
    # Implement logic to modify cooperation_threshold here
    
    # End of decision process
```

---

### **Summary:**

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability. By initially Cooperating, it observes opponents and adapts dynamically based on their behavior and the stock's health. Exploitation occurs when safe, ensuring maximum payoff without causing irreversible resource depletion. The approach is robust to various opponent behaviors and adjusts thresholds to maintain a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

**Final Answer:**

The exploitative strategy balances exploitation with sustainability by initially Cooperating, dynamically adjusting based on opponents' behavior and stock health, and defecting in the last round for maximum payoff without regard for future impact.

To address the problem, we'll develop a strategy that balances immediate gains with sustainable resource management. The key idea is to defect when resources are abundant (above a threshold) to maximize personal gain, while cooperating when resources are scarce to allow recovery.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Threshold Definition**: Establish a threshold T, typically set at half of the total capacity (T = capacity / 2). This threshold helps determine when to defect and when to cooperate based on the current resource level.

2. **Current Resource Check**: At each decision point, check if the current resource level S is above or below the threshold T.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - If S > T: Defect (D). This maximizes immediate payoff while allowing resources to recover through growth.
   - If S ≤ T: Cooperate (C). This helps prevent over-depletion and aids in replenishing resources for future exploitation.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the current state of resources, ensuring that exploitation doesn't lead to permanent resource depletion.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to defect when resources are above half capacity (S > T) and cooperate when they fall below this level (S ≤ T). This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

\boxed{D \text{ if } S > \frac{\text{capacity}}{2}, \text{ else } C}

description_EXPLOITATIVE_80 = '''
The AI's strategy involves balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting its actions based on the behavior of other players and the current state of the game. Here are the key points of the strategy:

1. **Early Rounds**: Start by defecting to exploit others' potential cooperation.
2. **Mid Rounds**: Track the average number of cooperators among opponents over recent rounds. If the proportion of cooperators is high, continue defecting. If it drops below a certain threshold, switch to cooperating to prevent stock depletion.
3. **Late Rounds Adjustment**: In the final few rounds, prioritize defecting to maximize immediate payoff.

Additionally, the strategy monitors the current stock level and trends in stock levels to adjust actions accordingly:

- Defect if opponents are mostly cooperating and the stock is high.
- Cooperate if opponents are mostly defecting or the stock is low.

The decision rule succinctly combines these factors:

\boxed{\text{Defect if opponents mostly cooperate and stock is high; otherwise, cooperate}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_81 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' cooperation while maintaining sustainable stock levels.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Encourage others to cooperate, creating a foundation for potential future exploitation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Calculate Previous Defection Rate:**
     - Determine the proportion of players who defected in the last round.
   
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If **defection rate < 70%** and not in the final rounds:
       - **Action:** Defect
       - **Rationale:** Exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate payoff while maintaining stock sustainability.
     - If **defection rate ≥ 50%** or stock is low (<30% of capacity):
       - **Action:** Cooperate
       - **Rationale:** Prevent excessive stock depletion, allowing recovery for future exploitation.

3. **Endgame Considerations (Last 2 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect Aggressively
   - **Rationale:** Maximize payoff in final rounds without concern for future sustainability.

---

### **Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:**
  - **Action:** Cooperate
  - **Rationale:** Set a cooperative precedent to encourage others.

- **Low Stock Levels (<30% of capacity):**
  - **Action:** Cooperate
  - **Rationale:** Preserve the resource for future rounds and potential recovery.

---

### **Exploitative Angle:**

The strategy exploits periods when others cooperate by defecting, gaining higher payoffs. When too many defect, it switches to cooperation to prevent mutual ruin, allowing stock recovery for future exploitation.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
Initialize:
    cooperate = True
    threshold_defect = 0.7
    threshold_cooperate = 0.5
    low_stock_threshold = 0.3 * capacity

For each round in 1 to r:
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        prev_defect_rate = (number of D actions last round) / n
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        
        if round > r - 2:  # Last two rounds
            action = 'D'
        elif current_stock < low_stock_threshold:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            if prev_defect_rate < threshold_defect:
                action = 'D'  # Exploit cooperation
            else:
                action = 'C'  # Prevent excessive depletion
    
    record_action(action)
```

---

**Summary:** This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting based on others' behavior and current stock levels. It maximizes payoff by defecting when beneficial and cooperating to maintain resource health for future gains.

To address the problem, we'll develop an exploitative strategy that maximizes our payoff by balancing immediate gains with resource sustainability. The strategy considers both opponents' behavior and the current state of the resource (stock). Here's how it works:

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to set a baseline.
2. **Recent Defection Rate**: Track the proportion of opponents who have defected in recent rounds.
3. **Stock Thresholds**: Use two thresholds based on the current stock level:
   - A low threshold (e.g., 50% capacity) indicating when to defect due to resource scarcity.
   - A high threshold (e.g., 90% capacity) where cooperation is encouraged to maintain resource sustainability.
4. **Decision Making**:
   - If the current stock is below the low threshold, defect to maximize immediate gains.
   - If a significant proportion of opponents have recently defected (above a defined threshold), defect to exploit their behavior or avoid exploitation.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to encourage sustainable resource use and future exploitation opportunities.

    - current_stock: The current amount of the resource.
    - capacity: The maximum possible stock capacity.
    
    Returns:
    - 'C' or 'D' as a string representing the chosen action.
    """
    # First round
    if not recent_opponent_actions:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent defection rate
    total_defects = 0
    total_possible = 0
    for round_actions in recent_opponent_actions:
        defects_in_round = len([a for a in round_actions if a == 'D'])
        total_defects += defects_in_round
        total_possible += len(round_actions)
    
    defection_rate = total_defects / total_possible if total_possible != 0 else 0

```

### Explanation
The solution employs a heuristic-based approach to decide between cooperation and defection:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts by cooperating to foster potential future cooperation.
- **Recent Defection Rate**: Tracks how many opponents have defected recently. If a significant proportion (e.g., 40%) defect, we switch to defecting to exploit or avoid exploitation.
- **Stock Thresholds**: Uses two thresholds to decide when to defect based on resource levels. Low stock triggers defection for immediate gains, while high stock encourages cooperation for sustainable use.

This approach balances exploiting others' cooperation with maintaining resource sustainability, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and opponents' actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_83 = '''
To implement an effective exploiting strategy while monitoring for resource sustainability, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Parameters**:
   - Set `Threshold (T) = capacity / 2` as the maximum sustainable total consumption per round.
   - Choose a buffer factor `beta = 0.8` to create a safer threshold: `Safe_T = beta * T`.
   - Define a lookback period `k = 5` rounds for trend analysis.

2. **For Each Round**:
   a. **Calculate Others' Average Cooperation Rate**:
      - For each player (excluding yourself), compute their cooperation rate as the number of times they cooperated divided by the total rounds played.
      - Compute the average cooperation rate `avg_p` across all other players.

   b. **Estimate Total Consumption if You Defect**:
      - Using `avg_p`, estimate others' contributions:
        ```
        E[TC_others] ≈ [1 - avg_p/2] * (S * (n-1) / n)
        ```
      - Add your own contribution as a defector:
        ```
        E[TC_defect] = E[TC_others] + S / n
        ```

   c. **Check Consumption Against Threshold**:
      - If `E[TC_defect] < Safe_T`, defect to maximize immediate payoff.
      - Else, switch to cooperation to prevent over-consumption.

3. **Monitor Stock Trend**:
   a. **Compute Average Stock Over Recent Rounds**:
      - Calculate the average stock level over the last `k` rounds: 
        ```
        S_avg = (Σ_{t-k}^{t-1} S_t) / k
        ```
   
   b. **Assess Current Stock Trend**:
      - If current stock `S > S_avg`, the resource is increasing; continue defecting.
      - If `S < S_avg`, the resource is decreasing; switch to cooperation.

4. **Combine Checks for Decision**:
   - Defect only if both conditions are met:
     1. `E[TC_defect] < Safe_T`
     2. Stock trend indicates an increase or stable level.
   - If either condition fails, choose to cooperate to help sustain the resource.

5. **Update History and Repeat**:
   - After making your choice (C or D), update each player's cooperation history for future rounds.
   - Proceed to the next round, updating `avg_p` and other parameters as needed.

This strategy balances exploiting others with maintaining a sustainable resource level, adapting dynamically based on recent trends and expected consumption patterns.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_84 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with the need to preserve resources for future exploitation. The strategy adapts based on opponents' behavior and current resource levels, ensuring optimal outcomes.

### Approach
1. **Early Rounds:** Exploit when safe by defecting if others are cooperating and resources are abundant.
2. **Mid Rounds:** Adjust actions dynamically based on opponents' defection rates and resource trends.
3. **Late Rounds:** Prepare for the final round by maximizing immediate gains while maintaining some resource sustainability.
4. **Edge Cases:** Handle first rounds, low stock situations, and high opponent defection rates with specific adaptive measures.

### Solution Code
```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.threshold = 0.75  # 75% of capacity
        self.low_stock_threshold = 0.25  # 25% of capacity

        if t == r:
            return 'D'  # Last round, defect always

        k = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions[-1] if action == 'D') if opponent_actions else 0
        n_opponents = len(opponent_actions[-1]) if opponent_actions and opponent_actions[-1] else (current_state['num_players'] - 1)

        # Update defection history
        self.defection_history.append(k)
        recent_defections = sum(self.defection_history[-3:]) if len(self.defection_history) >=3 else k

        if S_current < self.low_stock_threshold:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to allow recovery

        # Check if most opponents are cooperating
        if (k / n_opponents) <= 0.5 and recent_defections < (n_opponents * 2):
            # Exploit by defecting if stock is above threshold
            if S_current > self.threshold:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent further depletion
        else:
            # Too many defects, cooperate to preserve resource
            return 'C'

# Example usage within an environment:
class Environment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategy = Strategy()
    
    def run_round(self, state):
        action = self.strategy.action(state)
        # Update state based on action and others' actions
        return action

# Note: The actual implementation would require tracking opponent_actions across rounds.
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization:** Sets thresholds for resource levels (75% to defect safely, 25% to cooperate) and tracks opponents' defection history.
- **Action Selection:**
  - In the last round, always defects to maximize payoff.
  - Monitors opponent defection rates; if most are cooperating, defects when resources are sufficient.
  - Cooperates when resources are low or many opponents are defecting to preserve the resource for future gains.
  
This approach ensures that the strategy adapts dynamically, exploiting opportunities while preserving resources for sustainable exploitation in subsequent rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_85 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing payoff while balancing resource depletion, we can use an adaptive strategy that evolves through different phases of the game. This approach considers both the current state of the resource (stock) and the behavior patterns of other players.

### Approach
The strategy is divided into three main phases:

1. **Early Exploitation Phase**: In the initial rounds, focus on exploiting others by defecting when possible, provided the stock level is sufficiently high to avoid rapid depletion.
2. **Middle Adjustment Phase**: As the game progresses, adapt your actions based on the behavior of other players. If they are mostly Cooperating, continue to Defect to exploit them. If many are Defecting, switch to Cooperating to preserve the remaining stock.
3. **Late Preservation Phase**: In the final rounds, prioritize preserving the stock by Cooperating more frequently if the stock level is low, ensuring sustainable payoffs.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, total_rounds, current_round, history):
    # Parameters setup
    early_exploitation = 0.3 * total_rounds
    late_preservation = 0.7 * total_rounds
    early_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    late_threshold = 0.7 * capacity

    # Edge cases: first and last rounds

    # Late preservation phase
    elif current_round > late_preservation:
        if current_stock < late_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

    # Middle adjustment phase: consider opponents' behavior
    else:
        # Look back at the last 5 rounds or fewer if not enough history
        look_back = min(5, len(history)-1)
        recent_history = history[-look_back:]
        
        # Count Cooperations from other players in these rounds
        c_count = 0
        for round_data in recent_history:
            for action in round_data.values():

        total_actions = look_back * (len(history[0]) - 1)  # Exclude self
        cooperate_ratio = c_count / total_actions

        if cooperate_ratio > 0.6:
            # Exploit by defecting
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Preserve by Cooperating
            return 'C'

# Example usage:
# history is a list where each element is a dictionary of player actions in that round.
```

### Explanation
- **Early Exploitation Phase**: During the first 30% of rounds, if the stock is above 80% of its capacity, defect to maximize immediate gains. If below, Cooperate to prevent rapid depletion.
- **Middle Adjustment Phase**: From 30% to 70% of the total rounds, analyze recent actions of other players. If more than 60% of their actions are Cooperations, continue Defecting. Otherwise, switch to Cooperating to preserve the resource.
- **Late Preservation Phase**: In the final 30% of rounds, if the stock is below 70% of capacity, prioritize Cooperating to sustain future payoffs. If above, defect cautiously.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on both the current state and others' behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_86 = '''
The AI will employ a strategy that balances immediate gains from defecting against the need to preserve the stock for future rounds. It will monitor the current stock level and decide whether to defect or cooperate based on a predefined threshold relative to the capacity.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Monitor Stock Level:** The AI continuously observes the current stock level (S) in each round.
2. **Set Threshold:** A threshold is established, say 75% of the total capacity (C). For example, if C=100, the threshold is 75.
3. **Decision Rule:**
   - If S > Threshold: The AI chooses to defect (D) because the stock is sufficiently high that defecting can be exploited without overly depleting future potential due to growth.
   - Else: The AI cooperates (C) to help maintain or replenish the stock, ensuring sustainability for subsequent rounds.

**Answer:**

The AI will choose to defect when the current stock exceeds 75% of the capacity and cooperate otherwise. This strategy balances immediate payoff gains with the preservation of future payoffs through sustainable stock management.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_88 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting others' cooperation with sustaining the resource when necessary. The strategy adapts dynamically based on stock levels, remaining rounds, and opponents' behavior.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Cooperate in the first few rounds to build a stable resource base and assess opponents' behavior.

2. **Exploitation Phase:**
   - When the stock is healthy (above 75% of capacity) and there are enough rounds remaining, defect to exploit others' cooperation.
   - In the last few rounds, defect aggressively since future payoffs are negligible.

3. **Sustainability Focus:**
   - Cooperate when the stock is low (below 30%) or decreasing rapidly to prevent further depletion.
   - Monitor stock trends and switch to cooperation if the resource shows signs of collapse.

4. **Adaptive Behavior Based on Opponents:**
   - Track opponents' actions; defect more if they cooperate frequently, but increase cooperation if many are defecting to sustain the resource.

### Decision Rules:

- **First Rounds (Initial Cooperation):** Cooperate for the first 3-5 rounds.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Defect in the final 10% of rounds.
- **Stock Thresholds:**
  - **High Stock (>75% capacity):** Defect to exploit others' cooperation.
  - **Mid Stock (30%-75%):** Defect if stock is stable; cooperate if decreasing.
  - **Low Stock (<30%):** Cooperate to prevent depletion.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(current_round, remaining_rounds, stock, capacity, n, opponents_history):
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to build a stable resource base
    if current_round <= initial_cooperate_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Last few rounds: Exploit aggressively
    if remaining_rounds <= exploit_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    # Check stock levels and trends
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    mid_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    
    # Recent history of opponents' cooperation
    recent_cooperate_rate = calculate_recent_cooperation(opponents_history, window_size)
    
    if stock > high_threshold and recent_cooperate_rate >= cooperate_tolerance:
        return 'D'
    elif stock < low_threshold or (stock_trend.is_decreasing() and stock < mid_threshold):
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Decide based on opponents' behavior

            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Cooperate to start with a stable resource.
- **Rounds Near Capacity or Depletion:** Adjust actions based on thresholds and remaining rounds.
- **Sudden Strategy Shifts by Opponents:** Monitor opponents' behavior dynamically; adjust strategy if they switch strategies.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while adapting to different opponent behaviors, ensuring sustainability when necessary.

   - Monitor the number of players Cooperating. If most players are Cooperating (based on a threshold, e.g., >70% cooperation), switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains.
   - Track total consumption each round; if it's low (indicating high cooperation), exploit by defecting.

3. **Sustainability Check:**
   - If the stock level drops below a certain threshold or if the number of Defectors increases significantly, revert to Cooperating to prevent resource collapse and allow for recovery.
   - Use current stock levels to adjust actions; higher stocks may warrant more exploitation, while lower stocks require caution.

4. **Endgame Exploitation:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds (e.g., last 5 out of 50 rounds), defect as much as possible to maximize immediate gains without worrying about future sustainability.

**Decision Rules:**

- **Early Rounds:** Cooperate when stock is high and time remaining is long.
- **Exploitation Trigger:** If Cooperation rate exceeds a threshold, switch to Defecting.
- **Sustainability Threshold:** Revert to Cooperating if stock drops below a critical level or Defectors exceed a threshold.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Defect maximally in the last few rounds.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a stable base.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Defect without regard for future impact.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to player actions and stock conditions.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff by adaptively choosing between Cooperate (C) and Defect (D) based on stock levels, opponent behavior, and game progression.

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 10% of the game):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning:** Encourage others to cooperate and build up the stock for sustainable gains.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels and Trends:**
     - If stock is healthy (above a threshold) and growing, continue to cooperate.
     - If stock is low or decreasing rapidly, consider defecting to maximize immediate gains.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Final 10% of the game):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Reasoning:** Exploit remaining resources as future payoffs no longer matter.

4. **Adaptation Based on Opponent Behavior:**
   - If many players defect, increase defection to exploit the situation.
   - If cooperation is high, cooperate to sustain the resource and benefit from its growth.

5. **Threshold-Based Adjustment:**
   - Cooperate if stock growth is sustainable despite some defection.
   - Defect if stock isn't recovering, preventing long-term depletion.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Stock at Capacity:** Cooperate for sustainability.
   - **Stock Near Zero:** Defect to exploit remaining resources.

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = game_capacity()
    
    # Early rounds: encourage cooperation
    if current_round <= 0.1 * total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Late rounds: exploit remaining resources
    elif current_round > 0.9 * total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    else:
        # Calculate recent trends and opponent actions
        recent_stock = get_recent_stock_trend(history, 5)
        defect_count = count_defectors_in_last_rounds(history, 5)
        
        # If stock is healthy and growing
        if current_stock > capacity * 0.75 and recent_stock.increasing():
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Check opponent behavior
            if defect_count / n >= 0.6:  # Majority defecting
                return 'D'
            else:
                # If stock is low or decreasing, defect; else cooperate
                if current_stock < capacity * 0.5:
                    return 'D'
                else:
                    return 'C'
```

### **Explanation:**

- The strategy begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base.
- It adapts based on the stock's health and opponents' actions, defecting when necessary to exploit resources or sustain gains.
- In later rounds, it switches to defection to maximize immediate payoffs as future rounds lose significance.

This approach balances short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance against diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_91 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game scenario, we have developed a strategic approach that adapts based on observed player behavior and current resource levels. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by leveraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when advantageous.

### Approach
The strategy is designed with the following key components:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to follow suit, helping maintain a stable resource level.
2. **Detect Defection Trends**: Monitor recent actions of other players over the last few rounds. If a significant proportion (e.g., more than 50%) are defecting, switch to defecting for the next few rounds to exploit any remaining cooperation and maximize short-term gains.
3. **Stock-Based Decisions**: Use thresholds on the current resource level:
   - Cooperate if the stock is above a high threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) as the resource can sustain itself.
   - Defect if the stock is below a low threshold (e.g., 30%) to maximize immediate payoff before depletion.
4. **Final Rounds Exploitation**: In the last few rounds, defect unconditionally since there's no future punishment for depleting the resource.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, round_number, n_players, capacity):
    k = 3  # look back window (last 3 rounds)
    p = 0.5  # threshold proportion of defectors to trigger defecting
    m = 3  # defect for this many rounds when triggered

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number > (history_length - 2):  # last few rounds
        return 'D'
    else:
        recent_rounds = history[-k:]
        total_defectors = sum([sum(round_actions) for round_actions in recent_rounds])
        prop_defectors = total_defectors / (n_players * k)

        if prop_defectors > p:
            return 'D'
        else:
            if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity:
                return 'C'
            elif current_stock < 0.3 * capacity:
                return 'D'
            else:
                # Check trend of defectors in previous rounds
                prev_k_rounds = history[-k-1:-1] if len(history) >= k+1 else []
                total_prev_defectors = sum([sum(round_actions) for round_actions in prev_k_rounds])
                prop_prev_defectors = total_prev_defectors / (n_players * k) if prev_k_rounds else 0

                # If the proportion of defectors has increased significantly
                if len(prev_k_rounds) > 0 and (prop_defectors - prop_prev_defectors) > 0.05:
                    return 'D'
                else:
                    return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins by cooperating to foster a cooperative environment, which helps maintain resource levels.
- **Defection Detection**: By analyzing recent actions, the strategy detects if defecting is becoming prevalent. If so, it switches to defecting to exploit any remaining cooperation and maximize payoffs.
- **Stock Thresholds**: The strategy uses thresholds on current resource levels to decide between cooperation and defection. Cooperating when resources are abundant helps sustain them, while defecting when resources are low maximizes immediate gains before depletion.
- **Final Rounds Exploitation**: In the final rounds, defecting ensures maximum payoff without concern for future consequences.

This approach balances initial cooperation with adaptive defecting, optimizing individual payoff based on observed behavior and resource levels.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_92 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' behaviors while maintaining sustainability of the common pool.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and allow stock growth.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate (`avg_coop_rate`) among other players over the past `m` rounds (e.g., `m=3`).
   - Check if the current stock (`S_current`) is above a threshold (e.g., `0.6 * capacity`).
   - If both conditions are met (`S_current > 0.6 * capacity` and `avg_coop_rate > 0.5`), Defect to exploit cooperation.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate to support stock replenishment.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without affecting future rounds.

4. **Low Stock Threshold:**
   - If the current stock drops below a critical level (e.g., `0.3 * capacity`), switch to always Cooperate until recovery to prevent collapse.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect.
- **Low Stock (< 0.3 * capacity):** Always Cooperate to allow growth and prevent crash.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, n, r, capacity, stock_history, action_history):
    m = 3  # Number of past rounds to consider
    coop_threshold = 0.5  # Minimum cooperation rate to exploit
    low_stock_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    high_stock_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    elif current_round < r:  # Middle rounds
        # Calculate average cooperation rate among others in last m rounds
        recent_actions = action_history[-m:]  # Get actions from past m rounds
        total_players = n
        num_coop = sum(1 for actions in recent_actions 
                       for i, act in enumerate(actions)
                       if i != self_index and act == 'C')
        avg_coop_rate = num_coop / (total_players * m)
        
        S_current = stock_history[-1]
        
        # Decision to Cooperate or Defect
        if S_current > high_stock_threshold and avg_coop_rate > coop_threshold:
            return 'D'  # Exploit by defecting
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate
        
    else:  # Last round
        return 'D'
    
    # Additional check for low stock
    if S_current < low_stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
```

---

### **Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages a positive environment and allows the stock to grow, which benefits all players in subsequent rounds.
- **Exploitation When Safe:** By defecting when others cooperate and the stock is healthy, the strategy maximizes immediate payoff without risking long-term depletion.
- **Sustainability Check:** Switching to cooperation when the stock is low prevents collapse, ensuring future rounds can still yield payoffs.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** Maximizes payoff in the last round without concern for subsequent effects.

This strategy balances exploitation with maintaining a sustainable resource level, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors and current game state.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_93 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
Maximize personal payoff by exploiting opponents while maintaining sustainable resource levels.

**Strategy Overview:**

1. **Initial Round Behavior:**
   - Begin with cooperation to encourage a cooperative environment and set a positive tone for future rounds.

2. **Monitoring Opponents:**
   - Track the number of cooperators (C) and defectors (D) in each round to adjust strategy dynamically.
   - Use this data to identify patterns or dominant strategies among opponents.

3. **Stock-Based Decision-Making:**
   - Implement thresholds to guide cooperation or defection based on the current stock level:
     - **High Stock (Above High Threshold):** Exploit by defecting if a significant number of players are cooperating.
     - **Low Stock (Below Low Threshold):** Cooperate to prevent further depletion and sustain future payoffs.
     - **Mid-Range Stock:** Adjust decisions based on the proportion of recent defectors. Increase defection if many are defecting, otherwise cooperate.

4. **Endgame Handling:**
   - In the last few rounds, prioritize personal gain by defecting to maximize payoff without regard for future consequences.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    exploit_threshold = 0.6  # If more than 60% are cooperating
    defector_threshold = 10  # Number of recent defectors
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    last_round_actions = history[-1]
    cooperation_count = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions if action == 'C')
    cooperation_rate = cooperation_count / n
    recent_defectors = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions if action == 'D')
    
    if stock_level > high_threshold:
        if cooperation_rate > exploit_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif stock_level < low_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if recent_defectors > defector_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    # For last few rounds, prioritize defecting
    if round_number >= r - 2:
        return 'D'
```

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Cooperation Thresholds:**
   - Cooperate when stock is low to prevent collapse.
   - Cooperate in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.

2. **Defection Conditions:**
   - Defect when stock is high and many are cooperating (exploit).
   - Defect if recent play indicates a significant number of defectors (mirror behavior).

3. **Endgame Exploitation:**
   - In the final rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future sustainability.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to encourage others.
- **Last Rounds:** Shift to Defect to capitalize on remaining resources.
- **Stock Collapse Risk:** Maintain cooperation when stock is critically low.

**Conclusion:**
This strategy balances exploitation with the need to maintain resource levels, adapting dynamically to opponents' actions and current game state. By leveraging thresholds and monitoring behavior, it aims to maximize personal payoff while mitigating risks of resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_94 = '''
To address the problem of developing a strategy in a repeated game with perfect information, where players choose between Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), we can outline a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Understand the Game Mechanics
- **Players:** Multiple players interacting repeatedly.
- **Choices:** Each player chooses C or D each round.
- **Payoffs:** Payoffs depend on choices and may involve cooperation benefits or defection gains.
- **Stock Dynamics:** The stock (resource) affects payoffs and evolves based on consumption.

### Step 2: Define Thresholds
- **High Stock Threshold:** e.g., 75% of capacity. Indicates abundant resources where exploiting is safe.
- **Low Stock Threshold:** e.g., 25% of capacity. Signals need for conservation to prevent crashes.

### Step 3: Initial Strategy
- **First Few Rounds:** Start with Cooperating to encourage others to do the same and build a cooperative baseline.

### Step 4: Observe and Adapt
- **Previous Round Analysis:** After each round, note the number of Cooperators (C) and Defectors (D).
- **Cooperation Percentage:** Calculate the percentage of other players who Cooperated in the last round.

### Step 5: Exploit When Possible
- If more than a certain threshold (e.g., >60%) of others Cooperated:
  - **Defect:** Gain higher payoff while others sustain the stock.
  
### Step 6: Cooperate When Necessary
- If fewer than a set percentage (e.g., <40%) Cooperated:
  - **Cooperate:** Prevent resource depletion and allow growth for future rounds.

### Step 7: Adjust Based on Stock Levels
- **High Stock (>75%):** Be aggressive; defect if others Cooperate.
- **Low Stock (<25%):** Prioritize Cooperating to encourage regrowth.

### Step 8: Late Game Adjustment
- In the final few rounds (e.g., last 20%):
  - Focus on immediate gains by defecting, unless it would crash the stock too much for remaining rounds.

### Step 9: Dynamic Adaptation
- Continuously monitor others' behavior and adjust thresholds or actions based on their strategies to maximize personal payoff while maintaining sustainable resource levels.

### Final Strategy Summary:
1. **Start Cooperating:** Build a cooperative foundation.
2. **Observe Others:** Track cooperation rates each round.
3. **Exploit High Cooperation:** Defect if >60% others Cooperate.
4. **Preserve Resources at Low Levels:** Cooperate if stock is low or <40% others Cooperated.
5. **Adapt in Late Game:** Maximize immediate gains without causing severe crashes.

This strategy balances exploitation with cooperation, ensuring both high payoffs and sustainable resource management over time.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_95 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting cooperative behavior when beneficial, while maintaining adaptability to prevent over-depletion of the common pool.

---

### **Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Reasoning: Test others' reactions and maximize immediate payoff since future rounds can still recover from a single defect.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Conditions for Defection:**
     1. In the previous round, more than half of the players cooperated (C_prev > n/2).
     2. The current stock level is above half of the capacity (S > capacity / 2).
   - If both conditions are met:
     - **Action:** Defect (D)
       - Exploit cooperative behavior while ensuring the resource can recover.
   - Else:
     - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
       - Prevent over-depletion and encourage others to cooperate, sustaining the resource for future exploitation.

3. **Last Two Rounds (r-1 and r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - No future rounds to consider; maximize immediate payoff regardless of depletion effects.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock, n, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'  # First round: Defect
    
    elif 2 <= round_number <= r - 2:
        C_prev = count_cooperators(history[-1])  # Number of Cooperators in previous round
        
        # Check conditions for defecting
        if (C_prev > n / 2) and (current_stock > capacity / 2):
            return 'D'  # Exploit cooperative behavior safely
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent over-depletion
    
    elif round_number >= r - 1:
        return 'D'  # Last two rounds: Maximize payoff by defecting

def count_cooperators(round_actions):
    return sum(1 for action in round_actions if action == 'C')
```

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Always defect to test others' behavior.
- **Middle Rounds:** Cooperate if too many are defecting or stock is low, to encourage resource sustainability and prevent collapse.
- **Last Two Rounds:** Defect aggressively as there's no future impact.

---

### **Alignment with Exploitative Mindset**

This strategy maximizes individual payoff by exploiting cooperative players when it's safe (i.e., when stock levels allow for recovery). It adapts based on recent behavior and resource status, ensuring long-term exploitation opportunities while mitigating the risk of catastrophic depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_96 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Purpose: Observe others' behavior to gather data on their strategies.

2. **Mid Game: Exploit Cooperation**
   - **Condition:** When the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) and a significant proportion of players are cooperating.
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate payoffs.

3. **Adjustment Based on Trends:**
   - Track the number of defectors in recent rounds.
   - If the proportion of defectors exceeds 50%:
     - **Switch to Cooperate** to prevent rapid stock depletion and allow some growth for future rounds.

4. **Late Game (Last Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Maximize immediate gains without concern for future consequences since there are no subsequent rounds.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to observe others.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow stock growth.

**Summary:**

- Start by cooperating to assess others' strategies.
- Exploit cooperation when the stock is high and a significant number of players are cooperating.
- Adjust to cooperation if too many defectors threaten stock sustainability.
- Defect in the final rounds for maximum payoff, disregarding future impacts.

This strategy balances exploitation with strategic cooperation to maintain a sustainable resource level, ensuring robust performance against diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_97 = '''
To maximize payoffs while balancing immediate gains with future sustainability, we'll employ a threshold-based strategy that adapts to observed stock trends. Here's how it works:

1. **Threshold Setup**: Start by setting an initial defecting threshold at 60% of the capacity. This means if the current stock is above this level, you'll defect; otherwise, you'll cooperate.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Monitor the stock over several rounds. If the stock consistently decreases, lower the defecting threshold to encourage more cooperation and allow the stock to recover. Conversely, if the stock increases or remains stable despite defecting, maintain or slightly increase the threshold.

3. **Immediate Payoff vs Sustainability**: Prioritize defecting when the stock is high enough (above 60%) to ensure significant gains without risking severe depletion. When the stock dips below this level, switch to cooperation to foster growth and prevent long-term payoff loss.

4. **Adaptation Loop**: Continuously assess the stock's trajectory. If it shows signs of recovery after a period of cooperation, gradually reintroduce defecting at adjusted thresholds. This iterative approach helps maintain a balance between exploitation and preservation.

**Final Answer**

To maximize payoffs sustainably:
- Defect if the current stock is above 60% of capacity.
- Cooperate if below 60%, especially if the stock shows signs of depletion.
- Dynamically adjust the threshold based on observed trends to optimize gains over time.

\boxed{\text{Defect when stock > 60% of capacity; else cooperate.}}

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' behaviors while maintaining a balance to ensure long-term sustainability. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **First Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Rationale: Test opponents' behavior and exploit potential cooperators.

2. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Rationale: No future consequences, so defect to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Determine action based on the current stock level and recent opponent behavior.
   - **Thresholds:**
     - High Threshold (HT) = 0.8 * capacity
     - Low Threshold (LT) = 0.4 * capacity

   - **If Current Stock > HT:**
     - **Action:** Defect
       - Rationale: The stock is robust, allowing defecting without significant harm.

   - **If Current Stock < LT:**
     - **Action:** Cooperate
       - Rationale: Preserve the stock to allow regrowth and prevent collapse.

   - **Else (LT ≤ Current Stock ≤ HT):**
     - Calculate the cooperation rate among opponents in recent rounds.
     - **Cooperation Rate > 60%:**
       - **Action:** Defect
         - Exploit cooperators while the stock remains sustainable.
     - **Cooperation Rate ≤ 60%:**
       - **Action:** Cooperate
         - Prevent further depletion and encourage resource preservation.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Immediate defect to gauge others' strategies.
- **Last Round:** Defect without consideration of future rounds.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Prioritize defecting as the pool is resilient.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate to facilitate regrowth and avoid collapse.

### **Exploitative Mindset**

This strategy exploits opponents by defecting when they cooperate, especially in sustainable stock conditions. It adapts dynamically based on recent behavior, switching to cooperation when necessary to prevent resource exhaustion. By balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, the strategy aims to outperform a wide range of opponent behaviors.

   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Maintain the stock at its maximum capacity, allowing for potential exploitation in later rounds without immediate collapse.

2. **Adaptive Exploitation Based on Opponents' Actions:**
   - Track opponents' actions over recent rounds.
     - If the majority of opponents are Cooperating, exploit by defecting (D) to gain a larger share.

3. **Stock Thresholds:**
   - **High Stock (Above 80% of Capacity):**  
     - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - **Rationale:** The stock can sustain higher consumption, allowing exploitation without immediate depletion.
   - **Medium Stock (40%-80% of Capacity):**  
     - **Action:** Balance between Cooperate and Defect based on opponents' actions. If many are Cooperating, defect; if many are defecting, cooperate.
   - **Low Stock (Below 40% of Capacity):**  
     - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - **Rationale:** Preserve the stock to prevent further depletion and allow for regrowth.

4. **Final Rounds Handling:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds, prioritize maximizing immediate gains by defecting as much as possible, even if it leads to stock depletion.
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Exploit the remaining stock for higher payoffs without concern for future rounds.

---

### **Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:**  
  Cooperate to start with a stable stock level, setting up potential exploitation opportunities in subsequent rounds.

- **Last Round:**  
  Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future rounds to consider.

- **Stock Collapse Scenario:**  
  If the stock drops too low (e.g., near zero), switch to Cooperate to allow for minimal regrowth, but this is rare due to the strategy's adaptive nature.

### **Pseudocode Overview:**

```python
def exploitative_strategy(current_stock, history, round_number):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = maximum_sustainable_stock_level
    r = total_rounds

    if round_number == 1:

### **Summary:**

This strategy dynamically adapts to opponents' behaviors and the current state of the common pool. It balances exploitation with preservation, ensuring long-term gains while maximizing immediate payoffs when possible. By monitoring opponents and adjusting actions based on stock levels, the strategy remains robust against various opponent behaviors and game dynamics.

To maximize your payoff as an exploitative player in this repeated game without complete information about other players' strategies, you can adopt a threshold-based strategy. This approach allows you to exploit when resources are abundant and conserve them when they're scarce.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Assess the Current Stock (S):**
   - Determine the current stock level at the beginning of each round.

2. **Set a Threshold:**
   - Choose a threshold, typically a percentage of the maximum capacity (e.g., 80%). This threshold represents the point above which you decide to exploit (Defect) and below which you conserve (Cooperate).

3. **Decision Making:**
   - If S exceeds your chosen threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity), choose to Defect (D). This allows you to gain a higher immediate payoff by consuming more, slightly lowering the stock for future rounds.
   - If S is below or equal to the threshold, choose to Cooperate (C). This helps maintain or replenish the resource level, ensuring sustainable exploitation in subsequent rounds.

4. **Adaptation:**
   - Observe how your actions and others' influence the stock over time. Adjusting the threshold dynamically based on observed trends can optimize your strategy further, though a fixed threshold provides simplicity and effectiveness.

**Conclusion:**

By defecting when resources are plentiful (above the threshold) and cooperating when they're scarce (below the threshold), you balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. This strategy prevents rapid resource depletion while allowing periodic exploitation for higher payoffs.

$\boxed{\text{Defect if current stock exceeds 80% of capacity; otherwise, Cooperate}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_101 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and sustainability in a multi-player game where players can either cooperate or defect, we propose an exploitative strategy that adapts based on the current stock level, others' actions, and the progression of the game. The goal is to maximize individual payoffs while minimizing the risk of resource depletion.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation Phase**: Begin by cooperating in the initial rounds to build up the stock to a high level. This phase lasts for approximately 20% of the total rounds.
2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: As the game progresses, adjust a dynamic threshold that lowers the willingness to defect as the game nears its end. The threshold is calculated based on the current round and total number of rounds.
3. **Cooperation Rate Check**: In each middle round (after the initial phase), check the cooperation rate from the previous round. If more than 50% of players cooperated, defect to exploit their cooperation; otherwise, cooperate to help sustain or rebuild the stock.
4. **Endgame Exploitation**: In the final 20% of rounds, increase the tendency to defect as there is less future impact from depleting the stock.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, last_round_actions, total_rounds, current_round):
    # Calculate the threshold based on game progress
    threshold = capacity * (1 - (current_round / total_rounds) * 0.3)
    
    # Determine if we are in the initial or endgame phase
    is_initial_phase = current_round <= 0.2 * total_rounds
    is_endgame = current_round > 0.8 * total_rounds
    
    if is_initial_phase:
        return 'Cooperate'
    elif is_endgame:
        return 'Defect'
    else:
        # Check cooperation rate in the last round
        cooperate_count = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions if action == 'C')
        cooperation_rate = cooperate_count / len(last_round_actions)
        
        if stock > threshold and cooperation_rate > 0.5:
            return 'Defect'
        else:
            return 'Cooperate'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Phase**: By cooperating initially, the strategy ensures a higher stock level early on, which provides more opportunities for exploitation in subsequent rounds.
- **Dynamic Threshold**: The threshold decreases as the game progresses, allowing players to defect more freely towards the end when future impacts are less significant.
- **Cooperation Rate Check**: Monitoring the cooperation rate helps decide whether to exploit others' cooperation or switch to cooperating to prevent resource depletion.
- **Endgame Strategy**: In the final rounds, defecting becomes more favorable as there is little incentive to maintain the stock for future rounds.

This approach balances exploitation with sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on game progress and others' behaviors, aiming to maximize individual payoffs while managing the risk of resource collapse.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_102 = '''
To address the problem effectively, I'll outline a strategic approach based on the analysis above.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to develop an AI strategy for maximizing payoffs in a game where players can either Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), affecting a shared resource's stock. The challenge lies in balancing immediate gains with preserving the resource for future exploitation.

2. **Key Considerations**:
   - **Resource Dynamics**: Cooperating preserves the resource, while defecting drains it but offers higher immediate payoffs.
   - **Thresholds**: Setting thresholds helps decide when to exploit (defect) and when to preserve (cooperate).
   - **Observation of Others**: Tracking other players' actions can inform strategic adjustments.

3. **Strategy Development**:
   - **High Threshold (H)**: Defect when the stock is above H, exploiting the abundance.
   - **Low Threshold (L)**: Cooperate when below L to allow resource recovery.
   - **Middle Range Adjustment**: Between H and L, consider others' recent behavior to decide actions.

4. **Threshold Settings**:
   - Based on analysis, set H at 75% of capacity for exploiting when the resource is plentiful.
   - Set L at 25% to conserve when the stock is low, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.

5. **Final Strategy**:
   - If current stock >= 0.75 * capacity: Choose Defect (D).
   - Else if current stock <= 0.25 * capacity: Choose Cooperate (C).
   - Between these thresholds, adjust based on recent trends in others' actions to exploit when they sustain and preserve when they exploit.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy balances immediate gains with resource preservation:

- **Defect (D)** if the current stock is at least 75% of capacity.
- **Cooperate (C)** if it's below 25%.
- Between 25% and 75%, adapt based on recent trends: defect if others mostly cooperate, else cooperate.

This approach maximizes payoffs by exploiting when beneficial and preserving the resource for future exploitation.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitative Play (AEP)

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff while exploiting opponents’ weaknesses, adapting dynamically to their behavior over time.

---

### Decision Rules:

#### **1. Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative baseline to encourage others to also cooperate, which maintains the stock and allows for sustainable growth.
   - **Edge Case Handling:**
     - If more than 50% of players defect in any round during this phase, switch to Defect (D) in subsequent rounds until cooperation is observed again.

#### **2. Middle Rounds (Until Round r-3):**
   - **Action:** Adapt based on opponents’ behavior
   - **Rationale:** Maintain or exploit based on the level of cooperation/defection observed.
     - Calculate the average consumption per player from previous rounds.
     - If more than 50% of players are cooperating (i.e., consuming at C levels), continue to Cooperate (C).
     - If less than 50% cooperate, defect (D) in the next round to exploit the remaining cooperators and reduce their incentive to cooperate.

#### **3. Late Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Exploit the common pool with fewer concerns about retaliation since the game is nearing its end.
     - Focus on maximizing immediate payoffs without worrying about maintaining a sustainable stock.

#### **4. Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Track opponents’ cooperation rate over time:
     - If opponents consistently defect, increase defection rate to match their behavior and prevent being exploited.
     - If opponents show signs of cooperation (e.g., increased C usage), switch back to Cooperate to encourage mutual sustainability.

---

### Edge Cases:

#### **1. First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone unless the opponent count is overwhelmingly high, in which case defect if necessary.

#### **2. Last Round:**
   - Always Defect (D). No need for sustainability as there are no future rounds.

#### **3. Stock Depletion:**
   - If stock drops below 50% capacity:
     - Switch to Defect (D) temporarily to exploit the remaining resources before the stock collapses.
     - Resume Cooperate once stock recovers above 75%.

---

### Exploitative Mindset:

- **Exploit Cooperation:** If opponents cooperate, defect to gain a larger share of the payoff while they sustain the resource.
- **Prevent Being Exploited:** Monitor opponents’ behavior and switch to Defect if too many start exploiting the system.
- **Leverage Sustainability:** Maintain cooperation when it benefits mutual gains but defect when others are not reciprocating.

---

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds

    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to encourage sustainability
    if round_number <= 3:
        return C

    # Late rounds: Exploit with Defect
    if round_number > r - 3:
        return D

    # Calculate opponents' cooperation rate from history
    recent_history = get_last_k_rounds(history, k=5)
    coop_count = sum(1 for action in recent_history if action == C)

    # If most are Cooperating, join them
    if (coop_count / len(recent_history)) > 0.6:
        return C

    # Otherwise, Defect to exploit the remaining cooperators
    else:
        return D

    # Edge case: Stock is critically low
    if stock_level < 0.5 * capacity:
        return D

    # Default fallback (shouldn't reach here)
    return C
```

---

### Summary:

- **Initial Rounds:** Cooperate to build a cooperative environment.
- **Middle Rounds:** Adapt based on opponents’ behavior; cooperate if others are, defect otherwise.
- **Late Rounds:** Defect to maximize immediate payoffs with fewer concerns about future retaliation.
- **Edge Cases:** Handle stock depletion and late rounds with aggressive Defect strategies.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically to exploit opponents while protecting against being exploited.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_104 = '''
To determine whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round based on the current stock level S, follow this strategy:

1. **Set Thresholds:**
   - High Threshold (H): 70% of capacity.
   - Low Threshold (L): 50% of capacity.

2. **Decision Rules:**
   - If the current stock S is above H (70%), Defect to maximize immediate gain.
   - If S is below L (50%), Cooperate to help rebuild and prevent collapse.
   - Between L and H, Cooperate more often as you approach L to balance exploitation and conservation.

**Answer:**

The AI should cooperate when the stock is low to avoid collapse and defect when the stock is high to exploit others. The decision is based on thresholds:

Cooperate if S < 50% of capacity; Defect if S > 70%. Between these levels, Cooperate more often as the stock approaches the lower threshold.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S < 0.5C \text{ else Defect}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_105 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Move**: Start by defecting to maximize your immediate payoff.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each round, check the current stock level relative to capacity.
3. **Threshold Decision**:
   - If the stock is above 50% of capacity, continue defecting because others are likely maintaining sustainable use.
   - If the stock drops to or below 50%, switch to cooperation to prevent further depletion and allow regrowth for future exploitation.

This approach ensures that you exploit when possible and conserve when necessary, balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

**Answer**: The optimal strategy is to defect initially and continue defecting while the stock exceeds 50% of capacity. Once the stock drops below or equal to 50%, switch to cooperation to prevent depletion and promote regrowth. This strategy maximizes your payoff over time by balancing exploitation and conservation.

$\boxed{\text{Defect if stock > 50\%; Cooperate otherwise}}$

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts dynamically based on opponents' behavior and game state, follow these steps:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Immediate Exploitation**: Start by defecting to maximize immediate payoff.
2. **Adaptive Behavior**: Adjust actions based on observed stock trends and depletion rates.
3. **Endgame Exploitation**: Defect in the final round to maximize last-round payoff.

### Detailed Steps:

#### 1. First Round:
- **Action**: Defect (D)
- **Rationale**: Maximize immediate payoff from a high initial stock level.

#### 2. Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):
- **Monitor Stock Trends**:
  - Calculate the expected stock if all players had Cooperated.
  - Compare this with the actual current stock after consumption and growth.
  
- **Decision Logic**:
  - If the actual stock is significantly lower than expected, switch to Cooperate (C) in the next round to prevent further depletion.
  - Otherwise, continue Defecting (D) as others are maintaining resource levels through cooperation.

#### 3. Last Round (Round r):
- **Action**: Defect (D)
- **Rationale**: Exploit the remaining stock without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_history, capacity, n, r):
    if round_number == 1:
        return D  # First round: defect to maximize immediate payoff
    elif round_number == r:
        return D  # Last round: defect without regard for future
    else:
        # Calculate expected stock if all Cooperated in this round
        previous_stock = stock_history[-2]
        total_consumption_cooperate = n * (previous_stock / (2 * n))
        new_stock_cooperate = previous_stock - total_consumption_cooperate
        growth_cooperate = 2 * new_stock_cooperate * (1 - new_stock_cooperate / capacity)
        expected_stock = min(new_stock_cooperate + growth_cooperate, capacity)
        
        actual_current_stock = stock_history[-1]
        
        # Determine if others are defecting more than expected
        if actual_current_stock < expected_stock * 0.9:  # Threshold example (adjust as needed)
            return C  # Cooperate to prevent further depletion
        else:
            return D  # Continue Defecting

# Example usage over rounds
actions = []
stock_history = [capacity]  # Initial stock
for t in range(1, r+1):
    action = decide_action(t, stock_history, capacity, n, r)
    actions.append(action)
    # Simulate stock update based on all players' actions (simplified for example)
    if t > 1:
        previous_stock = stock_history[-1]
        total_consumption = sum([consumption])  # Get from actual player actions
        new_stock = min(previous_stock - total_consumption + growth, capacity)
        stock_history.append(new_stock)
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Defection**: Maximizes immediate payoff when the resource is abundant.
- **Adaptive Cooperation**: Switches to Cooperate if detecting rapid depletion, preventing mutual resource collapse.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Ensures maximum extraction in the last round without future concerns.

This strategy balances exploiting others' cooperation with prudent conservation, adapting dynamically to sustain higher payoffs over multiple rounds.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' cooperation while maintaining resource sustainability to prevent collapse.

---

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to observe others' behavior and maintain a stable stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Track the proportion of Cooperators among other players over the last few rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds).
   - Calculate the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If both conditions are met:
     a. Current stock is above 70% of capacity.
     b. At least 60% of other players have Cooperated in recent history.
     - Defect to exploit others' cooperation and gain higher immediate payoff.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate to help sustain the resource.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 20% of total rounds):**
   - If more than half of other players have Cooperated recently:
     - Defect to maximize short-term gains with minimal future consequences.
   - Else:
     - Cooperate to avoid depleting the stock excessively.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Low Stock (Below 30% capacity):** Always Cooperate to promote regrowth and prevent collapse.
   - **Most Players Defecting:** If over 70% of other players are defecting, Cooperate to mitigate further depletion and encourage others to reconsider their strategy.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, round_number):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = game_capacity()
    total_rounds = game_rounds()

    # First round: Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Determine recent cooperation rate among others
    recent_history_length = min(len(history), 5)  # Consider last 5 rounds
    recent_coops = sum(1 for h in history[-recent_history_length:] 
                       if (sum(1 for action in h.values() if action == 'C') - (1 if history[h][self] == 'C' else 0)) > 0)
    recent_coop_rate = recent_coops / recent_history_length

    # Check stock level
    stock_threshold = capacity * 0.7
    low_stock = current_stock < capacity * 0.3

    # Last few rounds: increase tendency to defect if others are cooperating
    is_last_rounds = round_number > total_rounds * 0.8
    if is_last_rounds:
        if recent_coop_rate > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

    # Decision logic
    if current_stock > stock_threshold and recent_coop_rate >= 0.6:
        return 'D'
    elif low_stock:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperate:** Begins by cooperating to maintain a stable stock, allowing observation of opponents' strategies.
- **Exploitation Window:** When the stock is healthy (above 70% capacity) and most others are cooperating, defects to gain higher payoff.
- **Sustainability Check:** If the stock is low or many others defect, cooperates to prevent collapse and promote resource regrowth.
- **Adaptation in Final Rounds:** In the last 20% of rounds, tends toward defecting if others cooperate, capitalizing on the limited future impact.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors while maximizing individual payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_108 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we outline a strategic approach that balances immediate exploitation with sustainable practices, ensuring maximum payoff over multiple rounds.

### Approach
The strategy involves three main phases:
1. **Initial Exploitation**: Start by defecting in the first round to maximize immediate gains.
2. **Sustainable Exploitation**: In subsequent rounds, monitor opponents' behavior and the current stock level. If others are cooperating sufficiently, continue defecting to exploit their contributions. If they start defecting heavily or the stock is low, switch to cooperation to maintain resource levels for future exploitation.
3. **Final Rounds Exploitation**: In the last few rounds, prioritize defecting again to maximize immediate gains without worrying about future consequences.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock_level, opponent_actions):
    # Parameters
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # 75% of capacity
    low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity   # 25% of capacity
    recent_rounds = 5                 # Look back at past 5 rounds for averaging

    if current_round == 1 or current_round >= total_rounds - 3:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate average cooperation rate of opponents in the last few rounds
    recent_coop_rates = [action == 'C' for action in opponent_actions[-recent_rounds:]]
    avg_coop_rate = sum(recent_coop_rates) / len(recent_coop_rates)
    
    if stock_level > high_threshold:
        return 'D'
    elif stock_level < low_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # If opponents are cooperating enough, exploit by defecting
        if avg_coop_rate > 0.5:  # More than half are cooperating
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Otherwise, help maintain the stock
            return 'C'

# Example usage (assuming capacity is defined and opponent_actions is a list of previous actions)
capacity = 100  # Set your capacity value here
current_round = 2
total_rounds = 10
stock_level = 80
opponent_actions = ['C', 'D', 'D', 'C', 'D']  # Example past actions

action = determine_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock_level, opponent_actions)
print(f"Action for round {current_round}: {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Exploitation**: The strategy begins by defecting in the first round to capture immediate benefits.
- **Sustainable Exploitation**: By monitoring opponents' cooperation rates and the current stock level, the strategy adapts. If others cooperate enough to maintain resource levels, it continues exploiting by defecting. When necessary, it switches to cooperating to prevent resource collapse.
- **Final Rounds Exploitation**: In the last few rounds, the focus shifts back to maximizing gains by defecting, as there are no future rounds left for negative impacts.

This approach ensures a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability, optimizing overall payoff over multiple rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_109 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase:**
   - **Objective:** Maintain a high stock level to ensure higher payoffs in subsequent rounds.
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C) in the first few rounds to build trust and keep the resource pool sustainable.

2. **Adaptive Exploitation Phase:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track the current stock relative to capacity. If the stock is high, defecting may yield higher immediate payoffs.
   - **Analyze Opponent Behavior:** Observe the number of players defecting. If a significant majority are cooperating, defect to gain an advantage without depleting the resource too quickly.

3. **Threshold-Based Defection:**
   - **Stock Threshold:** If the stock drops below 60% of capacity, increase defection frequency.
   - **Defect Rate Monitoring:** If more than half of players are defecting, consider defecting to prevent being exploited by others.

4. **Final Rounds Harvest Phase:**
   - **Objective:** Maximize immediate gains as future rounds are limited.
   - **Action:** Defect in the last few rounds to extract as much resource as possible before potential depletion.

5. **Pseudocode Outline:**

```pseudocode
Initialize cooperation for first x rounds (e.g., 20% of total rounds)

For each round from 1 to r:
    If current_round <= initial_coop_rounds:
        Play C
    Else:
        Calculate defect_rate = number_of_D / n
        If stock > 0.6 * capacity and defect_rate < 0.5:
            Play C if others are mostly cooperating, else D
        Else:
            Play D

Handle Edge Cases:
- First round: Cooperate to maintain high stock.
- Last few rounds (e.g., last 20%): Always Defect to maximize personal gain.

Adapt thresholds and behaviors based on observed opponent strategies and stock dynamics throughout the game.
```

This strategy balances initial cooperation with adaptive exploitation, ensuring maximum gains while considering both resource sustainability and opponent behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_110 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing payoff while considering resource preservation, we can employ a threshold-based strategy. This strategy involves defecting (D) when the stock is above a certain threshold and cooperating (C) otherwise, except in the final round where we always defect.

### Approach
The approach is as follows:
1. **Initial Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - If the current stock level exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), continue defecting.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to cooperating to help preserve the resource for future rounds.
3. **Last Round:** Always defect regardless of the stock level to maximize payoff in the final round.

This strategy balances exploitation with preservation, allowing maximum gain while preventing rapid resource depletion.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(stock_level, capacity, round_number, total_rounds):
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    elif round_number < total_rounds:
        if stock_level > threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    else:  # Last round
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round (Round 1):** The strategy starts by defecting to secure the highest immediate payoff.
- **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):** By using a threshold (75% of capacity), the strategy ensures that defecting does not lead to rapid resource depletion. If the stock remains above this threshold, defecting continues. If it drops below, cooperation helps preserve the resource for future rounds.
- **Last Round:** In the final round, defecting is chosen to maximize payoff without concern for future rounds.

This approach effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, providing a robust strategy for maximizing cumulative payoff while managing resource depletion.

To address the problem of maximizing your own payoff in a resource management game where you can observe others' actions but cannot communicate or coordinate with them, we propose a dynamic strategy that balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability. This strategy is designed to adapt based on the current state of the resource (stock level), the number of remaining rounds, and observed trends in opponents' behavior.

### Strategy Outline

1. **Early Exploitation Phase**:
   - **Objective**: Maximize immediate payoffs by defecting when others are cooperating.
   - **Action**: Defect in the first 30% of rounds to take advantage of higher per-round gains while testing the resource's resilience and opponents' behavior.
   - **Monitoring**: Track stock levels after each round and note how many opponents are defecting versus cooperating.

2. **Sustainability Check Phase**:
   - **Objective**: Preserve resources if they are depleting too quickly to ensure future exploitation opportunities.
   - **Criteria for Switching to Cooperation**:
     - If the current stock drops below 60% of capacity.
     - If the stock has been decreasing consistently over several rounds.
     - If a significant proportion (e.g., more than 50%) of opponents are defecting, indicating rapid resource depletion.
   - **Action**: Switch to cooperating to allow the resource to recover and grow, ensuring it remains available for future exploitation.

3. **Late Exploitation Phase**:
   - **Objective**: Prioritize immediate gains as the number of remaining rounds decreases.
   - **Action**: Revert to defecting in the last 20-30% of rounds, especially if the stock is still sufficient. If the resource is nearly depleted, minimize defection to avoid complete collapse.

### Rationale

- **Early Exploitation**: By defecting early, you capitalize on higher payoffs when others might be cooperating, testing how sustainable your actions are without immediate negative consequences.
  
- **Sustainability Check**: Monitoring stock levels and opponents' behavior allows you to adjust your strategy. If the resource is being overused (either by you or others), switching to cooperation preserves it for future rounds, preventing an irreversible collapse.

- **Late Exploitation**: As the game nears its end, the impact of current actions on future payoffs diminishes. Thus, prioritizing immediate gains ensures you maximize your total payoff even if it means depleting the resource in later stages.

### Conclusion

This strategy is a balanced approach that leverages early exploitation for immediate gains while ensuring long-term sustainability by adapting based on observed trends and stock levels. By dynamically adjusting between defecting and cooperating, you can optimize your payoff throughout the game's duration.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** Choose to cooperate when the current stock is below a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) or when others are defecting less, indicating a shift towards sustainability.
   - **Defect (D):** Choose to defect when the stock is above the threshold or when others are defecting more, exploiting the surplus and taking advantage of others' actions.

2. **Threshold Calculation:**
   - Use a dynamic threshold based on historical data. Initially set at 70% of capacity, adjust according to the moving average of defects in recent rounds. If defects increase, lower the threshold; if they decrease, raise it.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Default to defecting to exploit the high initial stock.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 2):** Increase defection frequency to maximize immediate gains without concern for future recovery.

4. **Adaptation and Learning:**
   - Track the proportion of defects by others using a moving average over recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - Adjust strategy dynamically: if defects increase, defect more; if they decrease, cooperate more.
   - Monitor stock growth and adjust threshold to maintain sustainable levels around capacity/2 for optimal recovery.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = game_capacity()
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    recent_defects = calculate_moving_average(history, window=5)

    # Adjust threshold based on recent defects
    if recent_defects > 0.6:
        threshold *= 0.9  # Lower threshold when others defect more
    else:
        threshold *= 1.1  # Higher threshold when others cooperate

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'  # Exploit high initial stock

    if round_number > (total_rounds - 2):
        return 'D'  # Maximize gains in last few rounds

    if stock > threshold:
        return 'D'  # Exploit surplus
    else:
        return 'C'  # Preserve resources

def calculate_moving_average(history, window=5):
    recent = history[-window:]
    defects = sum(1 for action in recent if action == 'D')
    return defects / len(recent) if recent else 0
```

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on stock levels and others' behavior, ensuring adaptability across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_114 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance between exploiting others' cooperation and maintaining the common pool resource to ensure long-term gains. Here's a structured approach:

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - If the stock is close to capacity and there are enough players, defect with higher probability to exploit potential cooperators.
   - Otherwise, default to cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Track the number of defectors in the previous round.
   - Use a dynamic threshold (`threshold_defectors`) based on current stock levels:
     - If the stock is high (above 70% of capacity), set `threshold_defectors` lower (e.g., 30%) to encourage defection when others cooperate.
     - If the stock is low (below 30% of capacity), raise `threshold_defectors` (e.g., 50%) to promote cooperation and prevent further depletion.

3. **Action Selection:**
   - If defectors in the previous round are below the threshold, defect to exploit others' cooperation.
   - If defectors exceed the threshold, cooperate to help sustain the stock.

4. **Adjustments Based on Stock Dynamics:**
   - Increase `threshold_defectors` if the stock is declining significantly.
   - Decrease `threshold_defectors` when the stock is stable or growing.

### Edge Cases:
- **Last Round (Round r):** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.
- **Depleted Stock:** If the stock is zero, cooperate to attempt replenishment, though growth may be limited.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, previous_defectors_count, current_stock):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = maximum_sustainable_stock
    
    if round_number == 1:
        # First round strategy
        if current_stock >= 0.9 * capacity and n >= 4:
            return 'D'  # Defect with higher probability
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate
    
    threshold_defectors = dynamic_threshold(current_stock, capacity)
    
    if previous_defectors_count < threshold_defectors:
        return 'D'  # Exploit others by defecting
    else:
        return 'C'  # Sustain resource by cooperating

def dynamic_threshold(stock, capacity):
    stock_ratio = stock / capacity
    if stock_ratio > 0.7:  # High stock level
        threshold = 0.3 * n  # Lower threshold to encourage defection
    elif stock_ratio < 0.3:  # Low stock level
        threshold = 0.5 * n  # Higher threshold to encourage cooperation
    else:
        threshold = 0.4 * n  # Moderate threshold
    
    return threshold

# Example usage over rounds
for t in range(r):
    action = decide_action(t+1, previous_defectors, current_stock)
    # Update state based on all players' actions
    # current_stock = new_stock_after_round
    # previous_defectors = count of 'D' actions this round
```

### Strategy Explanation:
- **Exploitation:** By defecting when fewer than a threshold of other players do, the strategy gains higher payoffs from others' cooperation.
- **Sustainability:** Switching to cooperation when defectors exceed the threshold prevents resource collapse, ensuring future gains.
- **Adaptability:** The dynamic threshold adjusts based on stock levels, making the strategy robust against varying conditions and opponent behaviors.

This approach aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining a balance to prevent complete resource depletion, adapting dynamically to different game states.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_115 = '''
To address the problem, we have developed a strategic approach that balances defecting for immediate gains with cooperating to sustain resources for future rounds. The strategy adapts based on other players' actions and the current state of the resource (stock). Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**: Start by assuming a neutral cooperation rate if no prior data is available. Set up variables to track total Cooperations, rounds played, and the current stock.

2. **First Few Rounds**: Begin with Cooperation to observe other players' behavior and establish an initial understanding of their strategies.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Calculate a threshold based on the observed cooperation rate from previous rounds. This threshold determines when to Cooperate or Defect:
   - If the current stock is below this threshold, Cooperate to allow resource regrowth.
   - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate gains while relying on others' Cooperation for sustainability.

4. **Last Few Rounds**: In the final 2-3 rounds, always Defect since there's no future payoff to consider.

5. **Continuous Monitoring and Adjustment**: Update the cooperation rate dynamically based on recent game outcomes to adjust the threshold accordingly. This ensures the strategy adapts to changing conditions.

**Final Strategy:**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first few rounds to observe others' strategies.
2. **Dynamic Threshold**: Calculate a threshold as `threshold = capacity * (1 - 0.5 * cooperation_rate)`. If the current stock is below this threshold, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.
3. **Endgame Exploitation**: In the last two rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate gains.
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously update the cooperation rate using an exponential moving average to quickly adapt to recent changes in others' behavior.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
# Initialize variables
total_C = 0
rounds_played = 0
cooperation_rate = 0.5  # Neutral assumption if no data
threshold_alpha = 0.5  # Weight for moving average

for t in range(r):
    if rounds_played > 0:
        cooperation_rate = (total_C / (n * rounds_played)) * threshold_alpha + cooperation_rate * (1 - threshold_alpha)
    
    current_stock = get_current_stock()  # Assume this function provides the current stock
    
    if t >= r - 2:  # Last two rounds
        action = 'D'
    else:
        threshold = capacity * (1 - 0.5 * cooperation_rate)
        
        if current_stock < threshold:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'
    
    # Update counters for next iteration
    if action == 'C':
        total_C += 1
    rounds_played += 1
    
    # Perform the action (e.g., send to server or update state)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Dynamic Threshold**: The threshold adjusts based on how many players are Cooperating. More Cooperations lower the threshold, allowing more Defecting; fewer Cooperations raise it, encouraging more Cooperation.
- **Exponential Moving Average**: This ensures the strategy quickly adapts to recent changes in others' behavior without being overly influenced by older data.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Switches to always Defecting in the final rounds to exploit any remaining resources without regard for future sustainability.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term resource management, adapting dynamically to maximize payoff while preventing resource collapse.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_116 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate in the first round(s) to encourage others to also cooperate, fostering a sustainable resource and higher payoffs.

2. **Midgame Dynamics:**
   - **Opponent Assessment:** Observe opponents' actions over the initial rounds. Identify those who consistently defect or cooperate.
   - **Dynamic Adjustment:** 
     - If the current stock is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), continue to cooperate to maintain resource sustainability.
     - If the stock is low, prioritize defection to maximize immediate payoffs before potential resource exhaustion.

3. **Endgame Considerations:**
   - In the last few rounds (approximately the last 10%), defect more frequently as there's no future payoff to consider, exploiting the remaining resource for higher immediate gains.

4. **Exploitation Opportunities:**
   - Target opponents who defect consistently by defecting against them, exacerbating resource depletion and maximizing personal payoffs.
   - If some players cooperate, exploit their behavior by defecting more often, knowing they will sustain cooperation despite your actions.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Round:** Defect unconditionally to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
   - **Stock Levels:** Adjust based on current stock; cooperate when high, defect when low.

6. **Implementation Notes:**
   - Track opponents' defection rates to dynamically adjust your strategy.
   - Incorporate slight randomness in actions to avoid predictability and prevent exploitation by other strategies.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, remaining_rounds, current_stock, opponent_actions):
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # Adjust as needed
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif remaining_rounds < 0.1 * r:  # Last 10% rounds
        return 'D'
    else:
        defect_rate = calculate_defect_rate(opponent_actions)
        if current_stock > threshold and defect_rate < 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with sustainable resource management, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors while maximizing long-term payoffs through calculated defection and cooperation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_117 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and preservation in a finite game with observable actions, we propose a strategy that adapts based on recent cooperation trends and stock levels. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Early Exploitation:**
   - In the first 20% of rounds, defect to test others' reactions and exploit their willingness to cooperate.

2. **Responsive Strategy:**
   - Track the average cooperation rate over the last 5 rounds.
   - If recent cooperation is high (>60%) and stock is above medium (e.g., >50%), defect to exploit.
   - If recent cooperation is low (<40%) or stock is below medium, cooperate to prevent further depletion.

3. **Late Round Adjustment:**
   - In the last 20% of rounds, prioritize immediate gain:
     - Defect if stock is above low (e.g., >25%).
     - Cooperate if stock is low to secure some payoff.

4. **Stock Thresholds:**
   - Medium Stock: 50% capacity.
   - Low Stock: 25% capacity.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

    # Define thresholds
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity

            if random.random() < exploit_prob:

    cooperation_history.append(cooperation_count / num_players)  # assuming normalized
    
print("Final Strategy implemented successfully.")
```

**Explanation:**
- **Early Rounds:** The strategy starts by defecting to exploit others' potential cooperation, testing the waters.
- **Middle Rounds:** It adapts based on recent behavior. If others are cooperating and the stock is healthy, it defects; if not, it cooperates to preserve resources.
- **Late Rounds:** Focuses on maximizing immediate gains by defecting when possible but switches to cooperation if the stock is low to ensure some payoff.

This approach balances exploitation with preservation, ensuring sustained benefits while adapting to changing conditions.

2. **Dynamic Decision Rules:**
   - **High Stock (S > 75% of capacity):**
     - If most players Defected last round, Defect this round to maximize immediate payoff.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate to maintain a stable resource level.
   - **Moderate Stock (25% ≤ S ≤ 75% of capacity):**

**Thresholds:**
- `threshold_high` set at 75% of capacity.

To maximize immediate payoff while considering some future sustainability, I will always defect unless the current stock falls below 30% of its capacity. At that point, switching to Cooperate allows the resource to recover, ensuring continued exploitation in subsequent rounds.

**Answer:** Always defect unless the current stock is below 30% of its capacity. In such cases, switch to Cooperate to allow recovery. Therefore, the strategy is:

- If S > 0.3 * capacity: Defect
- Else: Cooperate

To address the problem of balancing exploitation and preservation in a dynamic environment with multiple agents, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both current stock levels and recent behavior of other players. The goal is to maximize individual gain while avoiding catastrophic depletion.

### Approach
The solution involves using a combination of threshold-based decisions on stock levels and analyzing recent player actions to determine the optimal move each round. Here's a structured breakdown:

1. **Initial Exploitation**: Begin by defecting in the first round to exploit the high initial stock.
2. **Stock Monitoring**: For subsequent rounds (excluding the last), evaluate the current stock relative to capacity:
   - If the stock is below 50% of capacity, switch to cooperation to help preserve and regenerate resources.
   - If the stock exceeds 80% of capacity, continue defecting as the high stock can sustain some depletion without risking collapse.
3. **Adaptive Behavior**: When the stock is between 50% and 80%, assess recent behavior:
   - Check the defect rate over the last three rounds.
   - If more than half of all possible actions were defects, switch to cooperation to prevent further depletion and potential crash.
   - Otherwise, continue defecting to exploit the current stock level.
4. **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last round, defect since there's no future punishment for doing so.

### Solution Code

            k = 3
            start_round = max(1, round_number - k + 1)
            total_defects = 0
            for t in range(start_round, round_number):
                # Assuming history[t] contains the action of this player in previous rounds
                # For other players' actions, assume we have access to their history or an aggregate defect count
                # This part is illustrative; actual implementation would require tracking all players' actions
                total_defects += sum(1 for action in history[t] if action == "D")

            defect_rate = total_defects / (num_rounds_considered * capacity)  # Assuming each player can defect once per round
            
            if defect_rate > 0.5:
                return "C"
            else:
                return "D"
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Exploitation**: The strategy starts with defecting to exploit the high initial stock, maximizing immediate gains.
- **Stock Monitoring**: By setting thresholds at 50% and 80% of capacity, the strategy ensures that exploitation continues when sustainable but switches to preservation when necessary.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Analyzing recent player actions allows the strategy to adapt dynamically. If too many players are defecting, cooperation helps prevent resource collapse.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last round, defecting is optimal as there's no future punishment.

This approach balances between exploiting available resources and preserving them for future gains, adapting to both environmental changes and opponents' behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first three rounds, always Cooperate (C). This builds a cooperative precedent and allows observation of other players' behaviors.

2. **Observation Phase**:
   - After the initial rounds, gather data on each player's actions to identify patterns of cooperation or defection.

3. **Dynamic Threshold for Stock**:
   - Calculate a dynamic threshold based on the current stock level (e.g., 80% of capacity). If the stock is above this threshold, it's considered safe; otherwise, conditions are risky.

4. **Majority Influence Decision**:
   - Determine the majority action from previous rounds. If more than 60% of players Cooperated and the stock is above the threshold, Cooperate in the current round.
   - If fewer than or equal to 60% of players Cooperated or if the stock is below the threshold, Defect (D).

5. **Defector Tracking**:
   - Maintain a defect ratio for each player. If a player's defect ratio exceeds 60%, respond by defecting more frequently against them in subsequent rounds.

6. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - In the last three rounds, switch to always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

# Example usage:

This strategy balances exploitation with adaptive cooperation to sustain resources while maximizing personal gain.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_122 = '''
To address the problem of determining the optimal action (Cooperate or Defect) in each round based on the current stock, remaining rounds, and historical actions, we can outline a strategy using decision rules. This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability while leaning towards an exploitative approach.

### Approach
The strategy involves making decisions based on the following factors:
1. **Current Round**: The first round is always Defect to gain immediate payoff.
2. **Last Round**: Always Defect since there are no future rounds to consider.
3. **Stock Level**:
   - If the stock is high (>75% of capacity), continue Defecting as the resource can sustain higher consumption without significant drop in future growth.
   - If the stock is low (<25% of capacity), Cooperate only if a significant proportion of historical actions were Cooperations; otherwise, Defect to take advantage of others' cooperation.
4. **Remaining Rounds**: In middle rounds, consider the number of remaining rounds and others' actions:
   - If many rounds remain, exploit by defecting when most players are Cooperating.
   - As rounds near the end, switch towards Cooperating to preserve the resource for future gains.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    capacity = 100  # Assuming capacity is normalized to 100
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate the proportion of Cooperations in history
        cooperate_count = sum(1 for action in history if action == 'C')
        proportion_cooperate = cooperate_count / (round_number - 1) if history else 0
        
        remaining_rounds = total_rounds - round_number + 1
        
        if current_stock > capacity * 0.75:
            return 'D'
        elif current_stock <= capacity * 0.25:
            if proportion_cooperate >= 0.6:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            # Middle range
            if remaining_rounds > total_rounds / 3:
                if proportion_cooperate >= 0.5:
                    return 'D'
                else:
                    return 'C'
            else:
                return 'C'

    return action
```

### Explanation
- **First Round**: The strategy starts with Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
- **Last Round**: Always Defect since future rounds are not a concern.
- **High Stock (>75%)**: Continue Defecting as the resource is abundant and can sustain higher consumption without significant drop in growth.
- **Low Stock (<25%)**: Cooperate if others are mostly Cooperating; otherwise, continue Defecting to exploit their cooperation.
- **Middle Stock (25%-75%)**:
  - If many rounds remain, defect if at least half of the historical actions were Cooperations to take advantage of others' behavior.
  - As rounds near the end, switch towards Cooperating to preserve the resource for potential future gains.

This approach balances immediate exploitation with sustainable strategies based on the current state and historical data.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' behaviors while adapting to the dynamic state of the game. It balances immediate gains with sustainable exploitation across multiple rounds.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff and observe opponents' reactions.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Current Stock Check:**
     - If the current stock is above a high threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity), continue Defecting (D).
       - Rationale: The pool can sustain higher consumption, allowing exploitation.
     - If the current stock is below a low threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to Cooperate (C).
       - Rationale: Preserve the stock to prevent future crashes and enable further exploitation.
   - **Between Thresholds:**
     - Analyze opponents' recent actions:
       - **If many are Cooperating:** Continue Defecting (D) to exploit their cooperation.
       - **If most are Defecting:** Switch to Cooperate (C) to prevent over-depletion and aid recovery.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: No future rounds, so maximize immediate payoff.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:**
  - Always Defect (D) to gain higher initial payoff and assess opponents' strategies.
  
- **Last Round:**
  - Always Defect (D) since there's no impact on future rounds.

- **Stock Near Capacity:**
  - Continue Defecting (D) as the pool can sustain consumption without significant depletion.

- **Low Stock Levels:**
  - Cooperate (C) to aid recovery and prevent crashes, ensuring sustainable exploitation in subsequent rounds.

---

### **Adaptation and Exploitation**

- The strategy dynamically adjusts based on:
  - **Stock Trends:** If stock is rapidly decreasing, switch to Cooperate (C) even if above the low threshold.
  - **Opponents' Actions:** Track the prevalence of Cooperates vs. Defects in recent rounds, giving more weight to recent behavior.

- Exploit opponents by defecting when many Cooperate and switch to Cooperate when most Defect to preserve the pool for future exploitation.

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

    if round_number == 1:

### **Conclusion**

This strategy effectively balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability by adapting to stock levels and opponents' behaviors. It maximizes payoff while mitigating the risk of over-depletion through dynamic adjustments.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_124 = '''
To address the problem effectively, I'll outline a strategic approach that balances exploiting the resource when safe and conserving it when necessary. The strategy adapts based on observations of other players' behavior and the current state of the resource.

### Approach
The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoffs while considering the sustainability of the resource. It consists of two main decision rules:

1. **Resource Level Check**: If the current stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), cooperate to allow the resource to recover.
2. **Player Behavior Adaptation**: If more than half of the other players defected in the previous round, cooperate to prevent over-depletion; otherwise, defect to gain higher immediate payoffs.

This approach ensures that exploitation is maximized when others are cooperative and switches to conservation when necessary to sustain future exploitation opportunities.

### Solution Code
```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self, player_id):
        self.player_id = player_id
        self.threshold = 0.3  # 30% of capacity as the cooperation threshold
        self.defect_rate_threshold = 0.5  # If more than half defect, we cooperate

    def action(self, current_stock, other_players_actions, round_number):
        n = len(other_players_actions) + 1  # Total players including self
        capacity = 100  # Assuming the initial capacity is 100 as in examples
        
        if current_stock < (self.threshold * capacity):
            return "cooperate"
        
        # Calculate defect rate among other players from previous round
        if round_number > 1:
            prev_round_actions = other_players_actions[round_number-2]
            num_defectors = sum(1 for action in prev_round_actions.values() if action == "defect")
            defect_rate = num_defectors / (n - 1)  # Exclude self
            if defect_rate > self.defect_rate_threshold:
                return "cooperate"
        
        # If none of the above, defect
        return "defect"
```

### Explanation
- **Resource Level Check**: The strategy first checks if the current stock is below a predefined threshold (30% of capacity). If it is, the player chooses to cooperate to allow the resource to grow and prevent collapse.
  
- **Player Behavior Adaptation**: If the current stock is above the threshold, the strategy then evaluates the behavior of other players from the previous round. If more than half of them defected, the player decides to cooperate to avoid further depletion. Otherwise, the player defects to maximize immediate payoff.

This approach dynamically adjusts based on the observed actions of others and the current state of the resource, ensuring a balance between exploitation and conservation for sustainable payoffs over time.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_125 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' behaviors while adapting to game dynamics. It balances initial exploration with subsequent exploitation and handles edge cases effectively.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Exploration (Rounds 1-5):**
   - Cooperate in the first five rounds to observe opponents' behavior and establish a baseline of cooperation rates.

2. **Exploitation Phase (From Round 6 onwards):**
   - Calculate the cooperation rate from the previous `k` rounds.
   - If cooperation rate > 60% and current stock > 30% of capacity:
     - Defect to exploit others' cooperation while maintaining a sustainable stock level.
   - Else:
     - Cooperate to sustain or recover stock levels.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Periodically reassess opponents' cooperation rates every few rounds to adapt strategies based on changing behaviors.

4. **Endgame Handling (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - Prioritize defecting to maximize immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.

5. **Stock Considerations:**
   - Monitor stock levels and adjust actions to prevent excessive depletion, balancing exploitation with sustainable play for higher long-term gains.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to observe others' initial strategies.
- **Last Round:** Defect unconditionally to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, n, capacity, current_stock, history):
    # Parameters initialization
    exploration_rounds = 5
    cooperation_threshold = 0.6  # 60%
    low_stock_threshold = 0.3 * capacity  # 30% of capacity
    endgame_portion = total_rounds // 10

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round <= exploration_rounds:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate cooperation rate from the last k rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds)
        k = min(5, len(history))
        total_cooperations = sum([sum(round_actions == 'C') for round_actions in history[-k:]])
        cooperation_rate = total_cooperations / (n * k)

        # Check endgame condition
        if current_round > total_rounds - endgame_portion:
            return 'D'
        else:
            if cooperation_rate > cooperation_threshold and current_stock > low_stock_threshold:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Initial Exploration:** The strategy starts by cooperating for the first five rounds to gather data on opponents' tendencies.
- **Cooperation Rate Analysis:** By evaluating recent cooperation rates, the strategy determines whether exploiting others is feasible without causing immediate stock depletion.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Adjustments are made based on current trends and stock levels to balance exploitation with sustainable play.
- **Endgame Focus:** In the final stages, the strategy shifts towards maximizing short-term gains through increased defection.

This approach ensures a balance between immediate payoff maximization and strategic sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors and game conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_126 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we'll outline a strategic approach that balances exploiting others' cooperation with preserving the resource when necessary. Here's a structured breakdown:

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always defect to test the behavior of other players.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Middle Rounds):**
   - **Low Stock (<50% Capacity):** Switch to cooperation to allow the resource to recover.
   - **High Stock (>70% Capacity) and High Cooperation:** If more than 60% of previous actions by others were cooperation, defect to exploit their willingness to cooperate.
   - **Otherwise:** Default to cooperation to prevent over-depletion.

3. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10%):**
   - Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.

### **Edge Cases:**

- **Stock Too Low (<50% Capacity):** Cooperate to allow recovery, ensuring the resource can sustain future exploitation.
- **High Stock (>70% Capacity) and Others Cooperating:** Exploit by defecting while others maintain cooperation.
- **Early Rounds:** Test with defection to gauge others' strategies.
- **Late Rounds:** No preservation needed; defect to maximize gains.

### **Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Keep track of all previous actions to determine the average cooperation rate.
   
2. **Each Round (t):**
   - For the first round, always choose to defect.
   - For middle rounds:
     - If the current stock is below 50% capacity, switch to cooperation.
     - If the current stock exceeds 70% and more than 60% of previous actions were cooperation by others, defect.
     - Otherwise, cooperate.
   - In the last few rounds, always defect.

### **Conclusion:**

This strategy allows for maximizing personal gain while maintaining resource sustainability when necessary. By balancing exploitation with preservation based on current stock levels and others' behavior, it ensures long-term benefits without complete collapse of the resource.

**Final Answer:**
The optimal strategy is to initially defect, cooperate when the resource is low or when others are mostly defecting, exploit by defecting when the resource is abundant and others cooperate, and always defect in the final rounds. This approach is encapsulated as:

\boxed{\text{Defect early, Cooperate when resources are scarce, Exploit when possible, Defect late}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_127 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting others' cooperation with preserving the resource when necessary. The strategy adapts based on current stock levels, recent player behavior, and game progression.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Rounds (First 3-5 rounds):** Cooperate to build the stock and observe others' actions.
2. **Middle Rounds:** Analyze cooperation rates:
   - If high cooperation, defect to exploit.
   - If low cooperation, cooperate to preserve the resource.
3. **Later Rounds (Last 3-5 rounds):** Defect to maximize immediate gains since future rounds are limited.
4. **Stock Health Check:** Adjust actions based on current stock levels:
   - High stock: more likely to defect.
   - Low stock: switch to cooperation to rebuild.

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate to start building the resource and assess others' initial moves.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
   - Calculate average cooperation rate from recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - Assess current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If stock is above 80% of capacity: Defect, as growth can sustain the resource.
     - If stock is below 30% of capacity: Cooperate to prevent collapse.
     - Between 30-80%: Adjust based on cooperation rate:
       - If average cooperation > 60%, defect; else, cooperate.

3. **Last Round (t == r):**
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without worrying about future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, capacity, recent_cooperation_rates):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    average_coop = sum(recent_cooperation_rates) / len(recent_cooperation_rates)
    
    if stock_level > capacity * 0.8:
        cooperation_threshold = 0.4
    elif stock_level < capacity * 0.3:
        cooperation_threshold = 0.7
    else:
        cooperation_threshold = 0.5
    
    if average_coop > cooperation_threshold:
        return 'D'  # Defect if others are cooperating enough
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate otherwise

def exploit_strategy(round_number, stock_level, capacity, recent_cooperation_rates):

        return 'D'  # Always defect in the last round
    
    action = decide_action(round_number, stock_level, capacity, recent_cooperation_rates)
    return action
```

### Edge Cases Handling

- **High Stock Levels:** Encourage defection as growth can replenish the resource.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Shift to cooperation to prevent collapse and sustain future exploitation opportunities.
- **Game Progression:** Adjust thresholds dynamically based on observed trends in stock and cooperation rates.

This strategy maximizes immediate gains by exploiting others while preserving the resource when necessary, ensuring sustainability for continued exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_128 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Start with cooperation (C) to encourage a higher stock level for subsequent rounds.
   - **Last Round (r):** Always defect (D) since future payoffs are irrelevant.
   - **Intermediate Rounds (2 ≤ t < r):**
     - If the current stock (S_t) is above 75% of capacity and more than 30% of opponents have defected in recent rounds, choose to Defect (D).
     - If S_t is below 25% of capacity or shows a rapid decrease despite cooperation from others, Cooperate (C) to allow regrowth.
     - Otherwise, assess the trend: if stock has been increasing, consider Defecting; if decreasing, Cooperate.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to maintain a higher stock for future rounds.
   - **Last Round:** Maximize immediate payoff by defecting.
   - **Stock Near Capacity (S > 75%):** Exploit opponents' cooperation by defecting if others are defecting moderately.
   - **Low Stock (S < 25%):** Cooperate to allow regrowth and sustain future payoffs.

3. **Exploitative Mindset:**
   - Exploit when safe (high stock) and switch to cooperation when necessary (low or rapidly decreasing stock).
   - Track opponents' defect rates to adjust strategy dynamically, ensuring higher immediate payoffs without collapsing the resource.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
function decide_action(round, stock, capacity, opponent_actions):
    if round == 1:
        return C
    elif round == r:

                return D
            else:
                return C

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to both current state and opponents' behavior for optimal performance.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_129 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a dynamic approach that adapts to opponents' behaviors while managing the common pool resource effectively. Here's a structured plan:

### Strategy Overview
1. **Initial Exploration**: Start with defecting to assess opponent reactions and gauge their tendencies towards cooperation or defection.
2. **Observational Learning**: Track each opponent's past actions to identify patterns (e.g., frequent cooperators vs. defectors).
3. **Exploitative Play**: Exploit opponents by defecting against those who cooperate frequently, while mirroring (cooperating) with those who defect often to prevent rapid resource depletion.
4. **Stock Management**: Cooperate when the stock is low to facilitate regrowth, ensuring long-term exploitation opportunities.
5. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Continuously adapt strategies based on observed opponent behavior and current stock levels.

### Pseudocode Outline
```python

        # Mirror Defectors
        defector_count = sum(1 for oc in opponent_cooperation if oc < 0.2)
        if defector_count >= n * 0.5:
            return 'C'
    
    return 'C' if cooperate else 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Exploration**: The strategy starts by defecting to test opponents and gather initial data on their behavior.
- **Observational Learning**: It tracks each opponent's cooperation rate, identifying those who are more likely to cooperate or defect.
- **Exploitative Play**: Against frequent cooperators, it defects to maximize immediate gains. Against defectors, it mirrors their actions to maintain resource levels.
- **Stock Management**: When the stock is low (below 30% of capacity), it switches to cooperation to prevent depletion and allow regrowth for future exploitation.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: The strategy dynamically adjusts based on current stock levels and opponents' observed behaviors, ensuring adaptability across different game conditions.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against a wide range of opponent strategies while exploiting their tendencies effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_130 = '''
The optimal strategy combines exploiting opportunities when others cooperate and preserving resources when many defect. The decision rules are as follows:

1. **First Round:**
   - If the current stock \( S \) is at capacity, choose Defect (D); else, Cooperate (C).
2. **Last 10% Rounds:**
   - Choose Defect (D) to exploit whatever remaining stock.
3. **Other Rounds:**
   - Look at the past 3 rounds for other players' actions.
   - If the proportion of others' Defectors is below 30%, choose D; else, Cooperate (C).

Thus, the final answer is:

\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{1. First Round:} \\
&\quad \text{If } S = \text{capacity}, \text{choose Defect (D); else Cooperate (C).} \\
&\text{2. Last 10\% Rounds:} \\
&\quad \text{Choose Defect (D).} \\
&\text{3. Other Rounds:} \\
&\quad \text{If proportion of others' Defectors in past 3 rounds } < 30\%, \text{choose D;} \\

   - If the average defection rate of others exceeds 50%, switch to cooperating to prevent over-depletion.
   - If the current stock drops below 70% of capacity, increase cooperation to allow resource recovery.
4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Flexibly adjust behavior based on observed trends and thresholds to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_stock, capacity, other_players_history):
    # Parameters
    DEFECT_THRESHOLD = 0.7  # 70% of capacity
    D_RATE_THRESHOLD = 0.5  # 50% defection rate

    # Calculate current stock as a percentage of capacity
    stock_pct = current_stock / capacity if capacity != 0 else 1.0

    # If the stock is below DEFECT_THRESHOLD, cooperate
    if stock_pct < DEFECT_THRESHOLD:
        return 'C'

    # Calculate average defection rate among other players
    total_rounds = len(other_players_history[0]) if other_players_history else 0
    if total_rounds == 0:
        d_rate = 0.0
    else:
        total_d = sum([sum(player_actions) for player_actions in other_players_history])
        d_rate = total_d / (len(other_players_history) * total_rounds)

    # If average defection rate is above D_RATE_THRESHOLD, cooperate
    if d_rate > D_RATE_THRESHOLD:
        return 'C'

    # Otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff
    return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Exploitation**: The strategy begins by exploiting the resource when it's abundant (above 70% of capacity), aiming for maximum immediate gain.
- **Behavior Tracking**: By tracking other players' defection rates, the strategy adapts to collective behavior. If others are defecting frequently, cooperation is initiated to prevent rapid depletion.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: The strategy dynamically switches between defecting and cooperating based on both the current stock level and observed behavior, ensuring a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

This approach efficiently navigates the trade-off between immediate exploitation and sustainable use, adapting dynamically to maintain optimal resource utilization.

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' strategies while maintaining sustainability when necessary.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to observe opponents' initial moves and set a baseline for future decisions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - Current stock (S) is below 75% of capacity.
     - Number of Cooperators observed in the previous round is high, indicating potential sustainability benefits.
   - **Defect** if:
     - Current stock (S) is above 75% of capacity and more than half of opponents have Cooperated previously.
     - Round number is approaching the last third of the game (indicative of endgame scenarios).

3. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - Increase tendency to Defect as future rounds are limited, prioritizing immediate payoff over sustainability.

### Handling Edge Cases:

- **First Round:**
  - Cooperate to gather information on opponents' strategies without significant risk.

- **Low Stock Levels:**
  - Prioritize Cooperation to allow stock regrowth and prevent rapid depletion.

- **High Stock Levels:**
  - Exploit identified Cooperators by defecting, ensuring higher immediate payoffs while the resource can sustain consumption.

### Implementation Considerations:

- **Thresholds:** Use heuristic thresholds (e.g., 75% of capacity) for stock levels and cooperation rates to decide actions.
- **Opponent Behavior Analysis:** Track opponents' past actions to predict future moves and adjust strategy accordingly.

**Example Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
for each round in r:
    if round == 1:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        calculate current_stock
        count_cooperators_prev_round
        check_endgame_phase

        if current_stock < 0.75 * capacity or not endgame_phase:
            action = Cooperate
        elif count_cooperators_prev_round > n/2 and current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
            action = Defect
        else:
            action = Cooperate
    submit_action(action)
```

**Conclusion:**

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to opponents' behaviors while maximizing individual payoffs. It ensures adaptability across varying game conditions and opponent strategies, making it robust for tournament play.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_133 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and conservation in a dynamic environment where the stock's health and opponents' behaviors influence decision-making, we propose an adaptive strategy that evolves through three distinct phases: early exploration, middle adaptation, and late exploitation. This approach ensures maximum payoff while maintaining sustainability.

### Approach
The strategy is structured into three phases:

1. **Early Exploration (First 20% of Rounds):** 
   - Always defect to gather data on opponents' behaviors and stock trends without concern for long-term consequences.
   
2. **Middle Adaptation:**
   - Analyze recent cooperation rates among opponents and the stock's health using a moving average over a lookback window.
   - If the cooperation rate is high (>60%) and the stock is stable (above 80% capacity), continue defecting.
   - If cooperation drops below 50% or the stock falls below 70%, switch to cooperating to prevent further depletion.
   - Maintain the previous action if conditions are ambiguous to avoid oscillations.

3. **Late Exploitation (Last 20% of Rounds):** 
   - Increase defecting frequency, focusing on maximizing short-term gains with minimal concern for future rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, opponents_actions, stock_history):
    # Early Exploration: First 20%
    if round_number < 0.2 * total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    
    # Late Exploitation: Last 20%
    if round_number > 0.8 * total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    
    # Middle Adaptation
    W = min(10, int(round_number / 5))  # Lookback window size
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate in recent rounds
    recent_coop_rates = [sum(a == 'Cooperate' for a in round_actions) / len(round_actions)
                         for round_actions in opponents_actions[-W:]]
    coop_rate = sum(recent_coop_rates) / W if W != 0 else 0
    
    # Calculate stock moving average
    stock_ma = sum(stock_history[-W:]) / W if W != 0 else stock_history[-1]
    
    capacity = max(stock_history)
    normalized_stock = stock_ma / capacity
    
    # Decision criteria
    if coop_rate > 0.6 and normalized_stock > 0.8:
        return "Defect"
    elif coop_rate < 0.5 or normalized_stock < 0.7:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        # Continue previous action to avoid oscillation
        if len(opponents_actions) == 0:
            return "Cooperate"
        last_round = opponents_actions[-1]
        return "Defect" if sum(a == 'Defect' for a in last_round) > 0.5 * len(last_round) else "Cooperate"
```

### Explanation
The strategy begins with an exploratory phase where the player defects to understand the game dynamics and opponents' tendencies. Transitioning into the middle phase, the player adapts based on recent cooperation rates and stock health, ensuring sustainable exploitation while preventing resource collapse. In the final phase, the focus shifts to maximizing immediate gains, as long-term sustainability is less critical. This approach dynamically balances short-term gains with long-term viability, ensuring optimal performance across varying game conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_134 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and resource sustainability in a repeated game scenario, we propose a strategic approach that adapts based on current stock levels and game progression. Here's the organized strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Exploitation Phase**: Initially defect to maximize immediate payoffs by exploiting others who may cooperate.
2. **Sustainability Check**: Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity. Cooperate when the stock drops below a critical threshold (30% of capacity) to allow replenishment.
3. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the final few rounds, defect regardless of stock levels since future payoffs are irrelevant.

### Detailed Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round**: Start with defection to exploit potential cooperators and gauge others' strategies.
2. **Threshold-Based Cooperation**:
   - Cooperate if the current stock (S) is below 30% of capacity.
   - Defect otherwise, prioritizing immediate gains when resources are plentiful.
3. **Endgame Exploitation**: In the last few rounds (e.g., the final 5% of total rounds), defect regardless of S to maximize short-term payoffs without concern for future consequences.

### Rationale:
- **Exploitation Phase**: By defecting early, you capitalize on others' cooperation, enhancing your payoff while signaling a competitive strategy.
- **Sustainability Check**: Cooperating when resources are low prevents stock collapse, enabling recovery through growth dynamics. This ensures long-term playability and avoids scenarios where the resource is permanently depleted.
- **Endgame Adjustment**: As future rounds no longer impact current payoffs, defecting maximizes gains in the final stages without worrying about sustainable practices.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with necessary conservation to maintain a viable resource base for continued play.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_135 = '''
To determine whether to play 'C' or 'D', we evaluate both actions based on current stock and expected opponent behavior. We calculate potential payoffs and impact on future stock health.

1. **Assess Current Stock (S):** Determine if defecting will leave enough stock for growth, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.
2. **Estimate Opponents' Actions:** Use recent cooperation rates to predict how many opponents will play 'C' or 'D'.
3. **Calculate Payoffs and Impact:**
   - Compute total consumption and resulting stock after choosing 'C' or 'D'.
   - Evaluate growth potential from remaining stock for each scenario.
4. **Decision Criteria:**
   - Choose 'D' if it provides a significant payoff increase without dropping the stock below 50% of capacity.
   - Otherwise, choose 'C' to maintain resource sustainability.

**Answer:** Based on evaluating both actions and their impact on current and future payoffs, you should play \boxed{D}.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_136 = '''
### Exploitative Strategy Design

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff over the course of the game by exploiting opponents, while ensuring sustainability of the common pool resource to prevent collapse. The strategy is adaptive, leveraging historical data to inform decisions and balance short-term gains with long-term survival.

---

### **Decision Rules**

#### **1. Initial Exploration (First 3 Rounds)**
- **Action:** Defect
   - Justification:  
     Early rounds are used to test opponents' tendencies. If others cooperate, defecting yields higher payoffs. If most defect, this phase reveals the competitive nature of the opponent set.

---

#### **2. Adaptive Exploitation (Rounds 4 to r-1)**

The strategy adapts based on:
- Opponents' historical cooperation/defection rates.
- Stock dynamics and growth patterns.
- Payoff opportunities in each round.

**Key Variables:**
- `CoopRate`: Percentage of opponents choosing Cooperate in the previous round.
- `StockGrowth`: Growth rate of the stock after consumption.
- `PayoffThreshold`: Minimum payoff required to sustain cooperation efforts (calculated based on historical payoffs).

---

#### **3. Exploitation Phase**

**If `CoopRate` > 50%:**
   - **Action:** Defect
      - Justification:  
        High cooperation among opponents allows for exploitation. Defecting yields higher individual payoffs while still maintaining sustainable stock levels due to the remaining cooperators.

---

**If `CoopRate` ≤ 50% and `StockGrowth` < 20% of capacity:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
      - Justification:  
        Low cooperation rates indicate a risky environment where over-exploitation could lead to stock collapse. Cooperating preserves the resource, ensuring long-term sustainability.

---

**If `CoopRate` ≤ 50% and `StockGrowth` ≥ 20% of capacity:**
   - **Action:** Defect
      - Justification:  
        Moderate cooperation rates coupled with high stock growth allow for cautious exploitation. The resource can sustain the increased consumption without collapsing.

---

#### **4. Last Round (Round r)**
- **Action:** Defect
   - Justification:  
     In the final round, defecting maximizes immediate payoff since there is no future impact on the stock or opponent behavior.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect
      - Rationale: Initial exploration to gauge opponents' behavior.

2. **Stock Near Capacity (S ≥ 0.9 × capacity):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
      - Justification: High stock levels mean defects could lead to rapid depletion, risking future rounds.

3. **Stock Near Collapse (S ≤ 0.1 × capacity):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
      - Justification: Prevent further collapse and allow the stock to recover in subsequent rounds.

4. **When Opponents Are Highly Predictable:**
   - If opponents consistently cooperate, defect as much as possible.
   - If opponents frequently defect, cooperate to avoid mutual destruction.

5. **If Stock Growth Rate is Unusually High or Low:**
   - Adjust cooperation rates dynamically:
     - Higher cooperation if growth is low.
     - More cautious defection if growth is unusually high.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    # Parameters
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = max_stock_level
    payoff_threshold = calculate_payoff_threshold(history)
    
    # Initial Exploration Phase (First 3 Rounds)
    if round_number <= 3:
        return "D"
    
    # Calculate Cooperation Rate
    coop_rate = sum(action == "C" for action in history[-1]) / n
    
    # Stock Dynamics Check
    stock_growth = calculate_stock_growth(stock_level, capacity)
    
    # Decision Logic
    if coop_rate > 0.5:
        return "D"
    elif stock_growth < 0.2 * capacity:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"
    
    # Last Round Override
    if round_number == r:
        return "D"

def calculate_payoff_threshold(history):
    # Calculate historical payoff averages to determine thresholds
    pass

def calculate_stock_growth(current_stock, capacity):
    # Calculate expected stock growth based on current stock level and capacity
    pass
```

---

### **Exploitative Mindset**

1. **Test Opponents Early:**
   - Use the first few rounds to identify patterns in opponents' behavior.

2. **Leverage High Cooperation Rates:**
   - When most players cooperate, defecting maximizes individual payoffs without causing immediate harm to the stock.

3. **Prevent Stock Collapse:**
   - Cooperate when necessary to maintain sustainable stock levels and avoid mutual destruction with other defectors.

4. **Adapt Dynamically:**
   - Continuously adjust actions based on real-time data about opponents' choices and stock dynamics.

5. **Maximize Payoff in Final Round:**
   - Defect in the last round to capitalize on any remaining stock without worrying about future consequences.

---

### **Conclusion**

This strategy balances short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability, ensuring maximum payoff while adapting to diverse opponent behaviors. By dynamically adjusting actions based on cooperation rates and stock growth, the strategy remains robust across a wide range of scenarios.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_137 = '''
To maximize your payoff in a dynamic environment where cooperation and defection impact future rounds, follow this strategy:

1. **Initial Exploitation:**
   - In the first round, always defect to secure maximum immediate gain.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision-Making:**
   - For each subsequent round, calculate a threshold based on remaining rounds:
     \[
     Threshold = Capacity \times \left(\frac{Remaining Rounds}{Total Rounds}\right)
     \]
   - If the current stock exceeds this threshold, defect to exploit the resource.
   - If below, cooperate to preserve the resource for future exploitation.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Monitor the stock's trend and adjust your threshold dynamically if necessary, balancing between exploitation and preservation based on observed behavior and resource recovery rates.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Defect in the first round; thereafter, defect when current stock exceeds a dynamically adjusted threshold based on remaining rounds, else cooperate.}}

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to observe the behavior of other players and encourage potential cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Thresholds**:
     - HighThreshold: 80% of capacity
     - MediumThreshold: 60% of capacity
     - LowThreshold: 40% of capacity

   - If current stock > HighThreshold:
     - Count the number of Cooperators from the previous round.
     - If Cooperators are more than Defectors, Defect to exploit their cooperation.
     - Else, Cooperate to encourage others to follow suit.

   - If LowThreshold < stock ≤ HighThreshold:
     - Cooperate to help sustain and regrow the resource.

   - If stock ≤ LowThreshold:
     - Cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow for recovery.

3. **Endgame Adjustment** (Last few rounds):
   - Prioritize immediate payoffs by Defecting more, as there's no future impact beyond these rounds.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - First round: Start with Cooperate.
   - Stock at threshold: Use the higher threshold condition for decision-making.

This strategy balances exploitation of others' cooperation with sustainability, adapting dynamically to current stock levels and observed player behavior. It ensures long-term viability while maximizing immediate gains when conditions permit.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_139 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing individual payoff while exploiting others' cooperation without relying on specific patterns or coordination. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
1. **Initial Move**: Cooperate in the first round to encourage others to cooperate and set a baseline.
2. **Adaptive Play**: Monitor others' actions and the stock level to decide between Cooperating (C) or Defecting (D).
3. **Exploitation Thresholds**:
   - **Defection Check**: If a small number of players defect, respond by defecting more to exploit their cooperation.
   - **Cooperation Threshold**: If too many players defect, switch to cooperating to preserve the stock and prevent depletion.
4. **Stock Monitoring**: Use a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity) to determine when it's safe to defect or necessary to cooperate for sustainability.

### Detailed Strategy

1. **First Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
     - Encourages others to cooperate and provides initial data on their behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Defection Check**: Count the number of Defectors in the previous round.
     - If fewer than half defect, respond by defecting more to exploit cooperation.
     - If half or more defect, switch to cooperate to prevent stock depletion.
   - **Stock Threshold**:
     - If current stock is above 60% of capacity and decreasing moderately, consider defecting.
     - If stock is below 60%, Cooperate to preserve it.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**:
   - **Action**: Defect (D)
     - No future rounds to affect, maximize payoff in the final round.

### Pseudocode

```python
def strategy(current_round, n, capacity, stock_history, actions_history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return C
    else:
        previous_defectors = count(actions_history[-1], D)
        stock_level = stock_history[-1]
        
        # Check for exploitation opportunity
        if previous_defectors < n/2 and stock_level > 0.6 * capacity:
            return D
        else:
            return C
```

### Adjustments and Considerations
- **Threshold Adjustment**: The threshold (e.g., 60%) may need tuning based on the specific parameters of the game to balance exploitation and sustainability.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Continuously adjust strategies based on observed trends in stock levels and opponents' actions to maintain an exploitative edge.

This strategy dynamically adapts, exploiting cooperation when possible while preserving resources to sustain higher payoffs over multiple rounds.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Reasoning: Immediate higher payoff with no history to influence others' actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1:** Monitor the number of Cooperate (C) and Defect (D) actions from other players in the previous round.
   - **Step 2:** Calculate the cooperation rate = (number of C actions) / (total n-1 opponents).
     - If cooperation rate > threshold (e.g., 70%), continue defecting for higher payoff, assuming others sustain the stock.
     - If cooperation rate < threshold, switch to Cooperate to prevent stock depletion and ensure future gains.
   - **Step 3:** Assess current stock level:
     - If stock is above a high threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity), continue defecting as it's safe.
     - If stock is below a low threshold (e.g., 20%), switch to Cooperate to allow growth and avoid collapse.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Reasoning: No future rounds, so maximize immediate payoff regardless of others' actions.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```
for each round t in 1..r:
    if t == 1:
        action = D
    else:
        cooperation_rate = count(C_actions) / (n-1)
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        
        if t == r:
            action = D
        else:
            if cooperation_rate > 0.7 and current_stock > high_threshold:
                action = D
            elif cooperation_rate < 0.3 or current_stock < low_threshold:
                action = C
            else:
                action = previous_action  # Maintain strategy for consistency

    execute action
    record outcome
```

**Rationale:**

- **Exploitation:** Maximizes immediate payoff by defecting when others cooperate, ensuring higher shares.
- **Adaptability:** Adjusts strategy based on observed cooperation trends and stock levels to prevent long-term depletion.
- **Robustness:** Handles various opponent behaviors by dynamically switching strategies, ensuring sustainability without prior coordination.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, adapting to different scenarios and opponents' actions effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_141 = '''
To develop an adaptive and robust strategy for maximizing cumulative payoff in a dynamic environment where other players' behaviors can influence the outcome, we outline the following approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initialization:**
   - Track each opponent's cooperation history and defection count to predict their future actions.

2. **Round-by-Round Decision Making:**
   - **First Round:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     a. Predict opponents' actions based on their past cooperation rates.
     b. Calculate the expected total consumption if choosing Cooperate (C) or Defect (D).
     c. Compute the resulting stock levels and potential growth for both scenarios.
     d. Estimate next round's payoffs considering these outcomes.
     e. Choose the action that maximizes the expected total payoff, balancing immediate gain with future impact.

3. **Adaptation:**
   - Continuously update predictions based on observed opponent actions to adapt to changing strategies.

```

### Explanation

- **Initialization:** Track each opponent's moves to build a history of their behavior.
- **Predictive Analysis:** Use historical data to predict whether opponents will cooperate or defect in the current round.
- **Scenario Evaluation:** For both possible actions (C and D), calculate how choosing each affects the stock level and potential future payoffs.
- **Decision Making:** Choose the action that maximizes the expected payoff by considering immediate gains and future impacts.
- **Adaptation Loop:** After each round, update predictions based on new data to adapt to any changes in opponents' strategies.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term considerations, allowing it to adapt to varying environments and opponent behaviors while maximizing cumulative payoff.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_142 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round based on the current stock level and past trends, we can use a dynamic strategy that adapts to changes in the stock. The strategy balances exploitation (defecting for higher payoff) with cooperation to prevent collapse when others are over-defecting.

### Approach
1. **Early Rounds:** Start by defecting when the stock is high because growth can replenish it, exploiting others' cooperation.
2. **Stock Trends:** Track whether the stock increases or decreases after each round:
   - If the stock significantly increases, continue defecting as others are likely cooperating.
   - If the stock drops significantly, switch to cooperating to prevent further collapse.
3. **Threshold-Based Decision:** Use a threshold (70% of capacity) to decide between defecting and cooperating when trends are moderate.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, stock_history, capacity):
    # Initialize thresholds
    high_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    
    if not stock_history:
        return 'D'  # First round: defect
    
    last_stock = stock_history[-1]
    
    # Check for significant increase or decrease
    if current_stock > last_stock * 1.1:
        # Stock increased significantly, others are cooperating; continue defecting
        return 'D'
    elif current_stock < last_stock * 0.9:
        # Stock decreased significantly; switch to C
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Moderate change: use threshold
        if current_stock > high_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

# Example usage:
capacity = 100
stock_history = [capacity]  # Initial stock

for round_num in range(1, 11):  # Simulate 10 rounds
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    action = decide_action(current_stock, stock_history[:-1], capacity)
    
    print(f"Round {round_num}: Current Stock={current_stock}, Action={action}")
    
    # Update stock based on action (simplified for example)
    if action == 'D':
        consumption = current_stock / 4  # Each defector consumes S/n
        new_stock = current_stock - consumption * 4  # Assume all defect for simplicity
        growth = new_stock * 0.5  # Example growth rate
        new_stock += growth
    else:
        new_stock = current_stock
    
    stock_history.append(new_stock)
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization:** Set thresholds (70% and 30% of capacity) to guide decisions.
- **First Round:** Always defect to exploit others' potential cooperation.
- **Stock Trends:** Monitor if the stock increases or decreases significantly:
  - **Increase:** Others are likely cooperating; continue defecting for higher payoff.
  - **Decrease:** Switch to cooperate to prevent further collapse and allow stock recovery.
- **Threshold-Based Decision:** When trends are moderate, use the high threshold (70%) to decide between defecting and cooperating.

This approach dynamically adapts based on observed trends, balancing exploitation with cooperation to maintain a sustainable stock level.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_143 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll adopt a threshold-based approach that adapts to the current state of the common pool and historical player behaviors. The goal is to maximize your own payoff by exploiting opponents' cooperation while avoiding excessive depletion of the resource.

---

### **Strategy Overview: "Threshold Exploiter"**
1. **Objective**: Exploit opponents' cooperative behavior when safe, defect to gain higher payoffs when possible, and cooperate to sustain the resource when necessary.
2. **Key Idea**: 
   - Use a dynamically adjusted threshold (`S_th`) to decide whether to Cooperate or Defect based on the current stock level and historical trends.
   - Exploit opponents by defecting when the stock is sufficiently high (above `S_th`), but cooperate when the stock is low to avoid over-depletion.

---

### **Decision Rules**
#### 1. **Initial Threshold Calculation**:
   - Set an initial threshold `S_th_initial = capacity / 2`. This ensures that you defect when the resource is abundant and cooperate when it is scarce.
   - Adjust this threshold dynamically based on past stock levels and opponents' behaviors.

#### 2. **Cooperate or Defect Decision**:
   - In each round, observe the current stock level `S`.
   - If `S > S_th`: **Defect (D)** to exploit opponents' potential cooperation.
   - If `S ≤ S_th`: **Cooperate (C)** to preserve the resource and avoid over-depletion.

#### 3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**:
   - After each round, update `S_th` based on the observed stock dynamics:
     - If the stock increased significantly in the previous round (growth > 10% of capacity), decrease `S_th` by 5% to encourage more cooperation.
     - If the stock decreased significantly (consumption > 30% of capacity), increase `S_th` by 10% to allow more exploitation.

#### 4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff and test opponents' behavior.
   - **Last Round (r-th round)**: Always Defect (D) since there are no future rounds to penalize over-depletion.
   - **Stock Near Capacity**: If `S` is near capacity, prioritize Defecting to exploit the abundance.

#### 5. **Opponent Behavior Exploitation**:
   - Track opponents' historical actions (C/D). If many opponents Cooperate consistently, increase exploitation by defecting more aggressively.
   - If most opponents Defect frequently, lower `S_th` to cooperate and avoid further depletion.

---

### **Pseudocode**
```python
def strategy(history, state, parameters):
    n = parameters['n']
    r = parameters['r']
    capacity = parameters['capacity']
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    S = state['stock']

    # Initialize threshold if it doesn't exist
    if 'S_th' not in history:
        history['S_th'] = capacity / 2

    # Dynamic threshold adjustment based on stock dynamics
    if current_round > 1:
        prev_stock = history['prev_stock']
        growth = state['growth']
        consumption = state['consumption']

        # If stock increased significantly, encourage cooperation
        if (capacity - prev_stock) + growth > capacity * 0.1:
            history['S_th'] = max(history['S_th'] * 0.95, capacity / 4)
        
        # If stock decreased significantly, allow more exploitation
        elif consumption > capacity * 0.3:
            history['S_th'] = min(history['S_th'] * 1.1, capacity)

    # Edge cases: first round or last round
    if current_round == 1 or current_round == r:
        return 'D'

    # Decision rule based on stock and threshold
    if S > history['S_th']:
        action = 'D'
    else:
        action = 'C'

    # Track previous stock for next round's adjustment
    history['prev_stock'] = S

    return action
```

---

### **Exploitative Mindset**
1. **Immediate Payoff Maximization**: Defect whenever possible to maximize your own payoff, especially when the resource is abundant.
2. **Resource Sustainability**: Cooperate when necessary to prevent over-depletion and ensure long-term exploitation opportunities.
3. **Adaptation**: Continuously adjust your strategy based on opponents' behavior and stock dynamics to exploit patterns while avoiding mutual destruction.

This strategy balances short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability, allowing you to adapt to a wide range of opponent behaviors while maximizing your own payoff in the tournament.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_144 = '''
To create an exploitative strategy that balances immediate gains with resource preservation, follow this structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy is designed to maximize short-term gains while preserving the resource for future exploitation. It adapts based on recent player behavior and current stock levels.

---

### Decision Rule

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - *Reason:* Starting with cooperation allows the resource to grow, setting a foundation for potential future exploitation.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to T - Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - For each round `t` from 2 to `(T - 0.1*T)`:
     - Determine the number of recent rounds to consider (`k = min(t-1, 3)`)—up to the last 3 rounds.
     - Calculate the Defection Rate (`D_rate = (number of Ds in last k rounds) / (n * k)`).
     - **If** `D_rate > 0.5`:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - *Reason:* High defection indicates others are exploiting, so cooperating helps preserve the resource.
     - **Else if** current stock ≤ 60% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - *Reason:* Low stock warrants preservation to avoid rapid depletion.
     - **Else:**
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - *Reason:* Safe to exploit when others are cooperating and the resource is sufficiently high.

3. **Final 10% of Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect.
     - *Reason:* Maximize immediate payoff with no concern for future rounds.

---

### Example Scenarios

- **Scenario 1:** Early cooperation leads to a high stock. With few defections, you exploit by defecting in subsequent rounds.
  
- **Scenario 2:** High defection detected; switch to cooperate to prevent further depletion and stabilize the resource.

- **Scenario 3:** Low stock triggers cooperation to preserve what remains, avoiding contribution to rapid depletion.

---

### Conclusion
This strategy balances exploitation with preservation. It adapts dynamically based on recent player behavior and current stock levels, ensuring maximum payoff while managing resource sustainability effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_145 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing our payoff while considering the impact of our actions on future rounds. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initialization:**
   - **First Round Action:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline and observe opponents' behavior.

2. **Adaptive Play Each Round (from Round 2 onwards):**
   - **Step A:** Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round.
     - If this proportion exceeds 60%, Defect (D) to exploit their cooperation, as defecting yields a higher immediate payoff.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate (C) to encourage others and maintain resource sustainability.

3. **Stock Management:**
   - **Step B:** After each round, check the current stock level.
     - If the stock drops below 25% of capacity (critical threshold), switch to Cooperating more in subsequent rounds to allow regrowth and prevent resource depletion.

4. **Endgame Handling:**
   - In the last 20% of total rounds, increase defection frequency as future punishment is no longer a concern, maximizing immediate gains without regard for resource sustainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, stock_level, capacity, n_players):
    # First round: Cooperate to observe behavior
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate the proportion of Cooperators in the previous round
    prev_round_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    num_coop = sum(1 for action in prev_round_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    coop_proportion = num_coop / n_players
    
    # Check stock level against critical threshold
    critical_threshold = capacity * 0.25
    near_endgame = round_number > (r * 0.8)  # Last 20% of rounds
    
    if near_endgame:
        return 'D'  # Exploit in endgame
    
    if coop_proportion > 0.6:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # If stock is below critical threshold, prioritize cooperation
        if stock_level < critical_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'C'

# Example usage in the tournament
for round in rounds:
    action = decide_action(round_number, history, stock_level, capacity, n_players)
    submit_action(action)
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization:** Starting with Cooperate helps gauge opponents' initial strategies and sets a cooperative tone.
  
- **Adaptive Play:** By monitoring the proportion of Cooperators, we can exploit when others are likely to Cooperate. This balance ensures higher payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability.

- **Stock Management:** Ensuring the stock doesn't drop below a critical threshold prevents collapse, allowing continued exploitation in future rounds without depleting resources prematurely.

- **Endgame Handling:** In the final rounds, defecting maximizes immediate gains since there's no future punishment for resource depletion.

This strategy adaptively balances exploitation and cooperation based on opponents' behavior and resource levels, ensuring robust performance against various strategies.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Rounds:** Begin with Defect (D) in the first few rounds to exploit potential cooperators, maximizing immediate payoffs.
   - **Monitor Opponents:** Track the number of Cooperate (C) and Defect (D) actions from other players each round.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:**
     - If stock is above 75% of capacity, continue exploiting by defecting if others cooperate.
     - Below this threshold, switch to Cooperate (C) to preserve the resource for future rounds.
   - **Adjust Based on History:** 
     - If opponents consistently defect, reduce defection rate to prevent over-depletion.
     - Continue defecting when others cooperate significantly.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Defect to exploit potential early cooperators.
   - **Last Round:** Defect regardless of history, as there are no future rounds.
   - **Low Stock Early On:** Switch to Cooperate to rebuild stock for later rounds if possible.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
for each round in r:
    if current_round == 1:
        action = D
    else:
        count_coop = number of opponents choosing C last round
        count_defect = n-1 - count_coop
        stock_level = current_stock
        
        if stock_level > capacity * 0.75:
            if count_coop > threshold:
                action = D
            else:
                action = C
        else:
            action = C
            
    record action and payoffs

if current_round == r:
    action = D
```

**Explanation:**

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability. By defecting initially, it maximizes immediate gains when others cooperate. Monitoring opponents allows adaptation, reducing defection if others over-exploit to prevent resource collapse. The stock threshold ensures long-term gains by preserving resources when necessary, making the strategy robust across varying opponent behaviors and game parameters.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_147 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate in the first few rounds (e.g., 2-3 rounds) to observe others' behavior and allow the stock to remain stable.

2. **Exploit Cooperation:**
   - Monitor each round's actions. If more than 50% of players cooperate, defect to gain a higher payoff while they sustain the resource.

3. **Prevent Depletion:**
   - Track the stock level and consumption rates.
   - If the stock falls below half of the capacity (capacity/2) or has been decreasing consecutively for several rounds, switch to cooperating in future rounds to allow the stock to recover.

4. **Last Rounds Exploitation:**
   - In the last 2-3 rounds, defect as much as possible to maximize short-term gains since future payoffs are irrelevant.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def strategy(history, state):
    round_number = len(history) + 1
    n_players = state['n']
    stock = state['stock']
    capacity = state['capacity']
    r = state['r']

    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to observe and maintain stability
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'

    # Track cooperation rate in the previous round
    prev_round_actions = history[-1]
    cooperate_count = sum(1 for action in prev_round_actions if action == 'C')
    cooperation_rate = cooperate_count / n_players

    # Exploit when others are cooperating
    if cooperation_rate > 0.5:

    # Check stock health and prevent depletion
    if stock < capacity / 2 or is_stock_decreasing(history, state):
        return 'C'

    # Last few rounds: Maximize immediate gains
    if round_number >= r - 2:
        return 'D'

    # Default action based on current observations
    return 'C' if cooperation_rate <= 0.5 else 'D'

def is_stock_decreasing(history, state):

    recent_stocks = stock_history[-4:]
    return all(stocks[i] > stocks[i+1] for i in range(len(recent_stocks)-1))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts by cooperating to observe others' behaviors and maintain the resource's stability.
- **Exploitation:** When more than half of the players cooperate, defecting maximizes immediate payoff while exploiting their cooperative efforts.
- **Stock Preservation:** If the stock is low or decreasing, cooperation is resumed to prevent depletion and sustain future exploitation opportunities.
- **Endgame Exploitation:** In the final rounds, defecting maximizes short-term gains as there's no need to preserve resources for nonexistent future rounds.

This strategy dynamically adapts based on observed behavior and resource levels, balancing exploitation with preservation to maximize long-term payoff while exploiting others' potential cooperation.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs by exploiting others' cooperative tendencies while maintaining enough resource sustainability to prevent self-harm. It adapts dynamically based on the game state, opponents' behaviors, and remaining rounds.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Purpose: Establish a cooperative baseline and observe opponents without depleting resources early.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 4 to r-3):**
   - **Determine Current Stock Relative Thresholds:**
     - High Stock: If current_stock > 0.8 * capacity
     - Medium Stock: If 0.4 * capacity < current_stock ≤ 0.8 * capacity
     - Low Stock: If current_stock ≤ 0.4 * capacity

   - **Based on Stock Level and Opponent Behavior:**
     - **High Stock:**
       - If more than 60% of opponents cooperated in the previous round, Defect (D) to exploit their cooperation.
       - Else, Cooperate (C).
     - **Medium Stock:**
       - If current_stock is decreasing over rounds and majority defect, Cooperate (C) to allow recovery.
       - Else, if many cooperate, Defect (D).
     - **Low Stock:**
       - Cooperate (C) to prevent further depletion and aid stock recovery.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Purpose: Maximize immediate payoff with no concern for future rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate to observe initial opponent behavior without impact on stock.

- **Low Stock Early On:**
  - If current_stock drops below recovery threshold early, increase cooperation to facilitate growth and prevent collapse.

### Strategy Execution Pseudocode:

            return 'C'
        else:
            # Medium stock, balance exploitation and sustainability
            # Check previous round's actions

                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
```

### Summary:

- **Exploitation:** Target opponents' cooperation by defecting when they cooperate, maximizing immediate gains.
- **Sustainability:** Cooperate when stock is low or when too many defect to prevent resource collapse, ensuring long-term playability.
- **Adaptation:** Adjust based on current stock levels and opponents' historical actions, dynamically balancing between exploitation and preservation.

This strategy aims to outperform various opponents by leveraging their behaviors while maintaining a balance to sustain resources for continued exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_149 = '''
To develop an effective exploitative strategy in this multi-player game, we need to balance immediate gains with future sustainability by monitoring both the resource level and others' behavior. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Round**:
   - **Cooperate**: Start by cooperating to observe others' initial moves and encourage mutual cooperation.

2. **Middle Rounds (Until Last Two Rounds)**:
   - **Assess Stock Level (S)**: Compare S against thresholds (e.g., 50% and 75% of capacity).
   - **Evaluate Previous Defectors**: Calculate the proportion of players who defected in the last round.
   - **Decision Making**:
     - If S > 75% and defectors < 50%, **cooperate**.
     - If 50% ≤ S ≤ 75% and defectors < 40%, **cooperate**.
     - Otherwise, **defect** to exploit others' cooperation or mitigate resource depletion.

3. **Second-to-Last Round**:
   - **Evaluate Impact**: Consider the effect on the last round but still aim to maximize current payoff without excessive depletion.

4. **Final Round**:
   - **Defect Unconditionally**: Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - **Smooth Transitions**: Avoid abrupt strategy changes based on minor fluctuations in S or defector counts.
   - **Adjust Thresholds**: If necessary, tweak cooperation thresholds based on observed behavior patterns.

This strategy adapts to both the state of the resource and others' actions, balancing immediate gains with future sustainability. By dynamically adjusting decisions, it maximizes cumulative payoffs while mitigating the risk of resource depletion.

**Final Answer**

To maximize your payoff in a multi-player game where cooperation and defection impact future rounds, employ this strategy:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to observe others' behavior.
2. **Middle Rounds**: 
   - Cooperate if fewer than 50% defected last round and the stock is above 75%. Otherwise, defect.
   - If the stock is between 50% and 75%, cooperate only if fewer than 40% defected last round; else, defect.
3. **Second-to-Last Round**: Be cautious to preserve some resource for the final round but still aim to maximize your payoff.
4. **Final Round**: Defect unconditionally to maximize immediate gains.

This approach balances exploiting others' cooperation when beneficial with preserving resources to sustain future payoffs. The strategy is responsive to both the current state of the resource and the aggregate behavior of other players, allowing for dynamic adjustments to optimize outcomes over multiple rounds.

$\boxed{\text{Adaptively cooperate based on stock level and prior defection rates, defect in the final round}}$

To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy in a multi-player game where players can either cooperate or defect, we need to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The goal is to maximize total payoff over all rounds by exploiting others when possible while preserving the resource for future exploitation.

### Approach
The proposed strategy is adaptive and considers both the cooperation rate of other players and the remaining number of rounds. Here's a structured breakdown:

1. **Initial Round**: Start with cooperation to observe others' behavior without risking too much depletion.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the proportion of other players who cooperated in the previous round (p_coop).
   - Determine the phase of the game based on rounds completed:
     - **Early Phase**: Up to 70% of total rounds. Use a lower threshold for defecting.
     - **Middle Phase**: Next 20%. Increase the threshold to encourage more cooperation as we move towards the end.
     - **Late Phase**: Final 10%. Always defect regardless of p_coop or stock level.
   - Adjust the decision based on the phase and current stock level:
     - If in late phase, always defect.
     - Else, if p_coop exceeds the threshold and stock is above a certain level (e.g., 80%), defect to exploit others' cooperation.
     - Otherwise, cooperate to preserve the resource for future exploitation.

```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round**: Starting with cooperation allows observation of others without immediate risk.
- **Early Phase**: If more than half of other players cooperate and the stock is sufficiently high, defecting exploits their behavior while maintaining resource sustainability.
- **Middle Phase**: As the game progresses, a higher threshold for defecting encourages cooperation to preserve the resource, balancing immediate gains with future potential.
- **Late Phase**: Near the end, always defecting prioritizes maximizing immediate payoff since there's little future impact.

This strategy adaptively adjusts based on others' actions and remaining rounds, ensuring a balance between exploitation and preservation.

To determine whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock level, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the High Threshold (H):** Set H at 80% of the total capacity (e.g., 0.8 * capacity).
2. **Check Current Stock Level:**
   - If the current stock is above H: Choose to defect (D) to maximize immediate gains.
   - If the current stock is equal to or below H: Choose to cooperate (C) to help maintain sustainable stock levels for future rounds.

**Answer:** Cooperate if the stock level is at or below 80% of capacity, otherwise defect. 

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate}}$ when the stock is ≤ 80% of capacity; $\boxed{\text{Defect}}$ when it's > 80%.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_152 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Begin with cooperation in the first round(s) when the stock is at its maximum capacity. This helps sustain higher payoffs in subsequent rounds by maintaining a healthy resource level.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision-Making:**
   - Establish an adaptive threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity). Cooperate if the current stock is above this threshold; defect otherwise.
   - Adjust the threshold dynamically based on opponents' actions:
     - Lower the threshold if many defect, encouraging more cooperation when needed.
     - Raise it if cooperation is prevalent to maximize gains without depleting resources.

3. **Monitoring Opponents:**
   - Track each round's cooperation and defection rates among opponents.
   - Use historical data to predict future states and adapt strategies accordingly.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds, switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoffs, as there is no future punishment for overusing resources.

5. **Sustainability Considerations:**
   - Avoid letting the stock drop too low to prevent recovery issues.
   - Balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability to exploit opponents without ruining resource potential.

6. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Adjust strategies based on opponent behavior trends and historical performance.
   - Include smoothing factors or inertia in threshold adjustments to avoid oscillations between cooperation and defection.

7. **Testing and Refinement:**
   - Test against various opponent profiles (all Cooperate, all Defect, mixed) to fine-tune parameters like thresholds and adaptation rates.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
Initialize threshold = 0.7 * capacity
last_rounds = r - 5  # Adjust based on total rounds

for each round in r:
    if round is the first few rounds:
        action = C
    else:
        calculate current cooperation rate among opponents
        update threshold based on opponents' actions and historical data
        if stock > threshold or round > last_rounds:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C
    record action and payoff
    update stock based on all players' actions

end of game
```

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically to exploit opponents while ensuring continued resource availability for maximum long-term gain.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_153 = '''
**Final Answer: Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff with no history of others' actions.
- **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
  - Calculate the proportion of defectors in the last 3 rounds.
  - If current stock is below a low threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), cooperate (C) to aid replenishment.
  - If more than half (50%) of recent actions are defects, switch to cooperate to prevent resource collapse.
  - Otherwise, defect to exploit others and gain higher payoffs.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize final payoff without concern for future rounds.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- In the first round, defect due to no prior information.
- In the last round, defect since there's no future impact.
- If stock is critically low, cooperate temporarily to ensure some regrowth for potential future gains.

**3. Exploitative Mindset:**
The strategy primarily defects to exploit others' contributions but adapts by cooperating when necessary to prevent resource collapse and sustain long-term exploitation opportunities.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```plaintext
for each round t in 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = D
    else:
        recent_defectors = count of defectors in last 3 rounds / n
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        
        if current_stock < low_threshold:
            action = C
        elif recent_defectors > high_threshold (e.g., 0.5):
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    commit to action and observe others' actions
end for
```

**Rationale:**
This strategy balances immediate exploitation with strategic cooperation when necessary, ensuring sustainability without relying on specific coordination mechanisms. It adapts dynamically based on past behaviors and current stock levels, making it robust against diverse opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_154 = '''
To optimize your exploitative strategy in this repeated game while managing resource sustainability, follow these steps:

1. **Early Exploration (First 25% of Rounds):**
   - **Defect:** Start by defecting to test others' behavior and assess how much the stock depletes.
   - **Monitor Consumption:** Track total consumption each round to infer others' strategies.

2. **Adaptive Play in Middle Rounds:**
   - **Dynamic Threshold for Cooperation:** If the current stock is below a critical level (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to cooperating to allow regrowth.
   - **Assess Aggregate Behavior:** If total consumption is high, indicating widespread defection, increase cooperation to preserve the resource.

3. **Late Rounds Strategy (Last 25% of Rounds):**
   - **Maximize Defection:** Focus on defecting as much as possible since future payoffs are limited.

4. **Stock Management:**
   - **Cooperate When Low Stock:** If the stock drops below a critical threshold, cooperate to facilitate regrowth for continued exploitation.
   - **Adjust Based on Growth Rates:** Monitor how stock levels recover and adjust your cooperation-defection ratio accordingly.

**Final Answer:**

To balance immediate gains with resource sustainability while exploiting others, defect in early rounds, adaptively switch to cooperation when the stock is low, and maximize defection towards the end. This strategy ensures higher payoffs without causing rapid resource collapse. The final answer is:

$\boxed{\text{Defect initially, cooperate when stock is low, and defect more as the game ends}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_155 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate and future payoffs while considering others' strategies, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate.
   - Reasoning: Starting with cooperation helps establish a baseline for observing others' behaviors.

2. **Middle Rounds (All rounds except the last few)**:
   - Calculate the current stock level, \( S \).
   - Determine the trend of \( S \) over recent rounds (e.g., 3-5 previous rounds):
     - If \( S \) is increasing: Defect. Higher consumption can be sustained by growth.
     - If \( S \) is decreasing: Cooperate. Allow \( S \) to recover.
     - If \( S \) is stable:
       - Look at the proportion of defectors in recent rounds.
       - High defection rate: Cooperate to preserve \( S \).
       - Low defection rate: Defect to exploit cooperation.

3. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds)**:
   - Increase tendency to defect, focusing on maximizing immediate payoffs with less concern for future impacts.

### Explanation

- **Trend Analysis**: By monitoring the trend of \( S \), we adapt our actions based on whether consumption is outpacing growth or vice versa.
- **Behavioral Adjustment**: Depending on others' defection rates, we adjust our strategy to either exploit cooperation or conserve resources when necessary.
- **Endgame Focus**: As the game nears its end, defecting more aggressively maximizes short-term gains.

This strategy dynamically balances exploitation and conservation, aiming to maximize total payoffs while considering both stock dynamics and opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_156 = '''
To address the problem of developing an exploitative strategy in a repeated game where players aim to maximize their payoffs, we propose a dynamic approach that adapts based on opponents' behavior and the current state of the resource (stock level). The strategy balances immediate gains with maintaining a sustainable resource for future exploitation.

### Approach
The strategy is divided into three phases:

1. **Initial Phase (Early Rounds):** Cooperate to build up the stock and encourage others to do the same, ensuring higher payoffs in the near term without depleting the resource excessively.

2. **Middle Phase:** Monitor opponents' actions over recent rounds. If a significant proportion of players have been defecting, adapt by defecting as well. This allows exploiting opponents while preventing being exploited by them.

3. **Late Phase (Final Rounds):** Increase defection frequency to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited. Exploit any remaining cooperation for higher gains in these final rounds.

Additionally, the strategy considers the current stock level:
- If the stock is high enough, defecting is profitable without significantly harming sustainability.
- If the stock is low, prioritize cooperation to allow replenishment for continued exploitation.

### Solution Code

### Explanation
The strategy dynamically adapts based on the game's phase and opponents' behavior:
- **Early Rounds:** Cooperate to encourage a stable resource level.
- **Middle Rounds:** Monitor defects. If most opponents are defecting, respond by defecting to exploit their behavior while ensuring the stock remains sustainable.
- **Late Rounds:** Increase defection frequency to maximize immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, allowing for effective exploitation of opponents' strategies while maintaining resource levels for continued gameplay.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** When the current stock is below a dynamic threshold, or when most opponents are defecting significantly to deplete resources rapidly.
   - **Defect (D):** When the current stock is above the threshold and/or when many players are cooperating, allowing exploitation of their efforts.

2. **Adaptive Thresholds:**
   - The threshold is dynamically adjusted based on remaining rounds and player count. For example, in later rounds or with fewer players, the threshold decreases to exploit more aggressively.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds):** Increase tendency to defect to grab remaining resources regardless of others' actions.

4. **Behavioral Adaptation:**
   - Monitor opponents' past actions; if most are defecting, continue defecting as their behavior supports rapid exploitation.
   - If many are cooperating, exploit by defecting while they sustain the stock.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```python
def decision(state, history):
    round_number = state['round']
    total_rounds = state['r']
    stock = state['stock']
    n_players = state['n']
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    
    # Determine thresholds based on game parameters and progress
    progress = round_number / total_rounds

    # Analyze opponent actions in recent rounds
    recent_history = history[-5:] if len(history) >=5 else history
    num_defectors = sum(round_data.count('D') for round_data in recent_history)
    
    # Heuristic for switching strategies
    if stock > threshold and (num_defectors / n_players) > 0.5:
        return 'D'
    elif stock <= threshold or (total_rounds - round_number < total_rounds * 0.1):
        return 'C' if stock > 0 else 'D'
    
    # If none apply, default to defecting
    return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Exploitation:** Start by defecting to gain immediate benefits.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** As the game progresses, adjust how much you exploit based on remaining rounds and player behavior.
- **Opponent Behavior Adaptation:** If opponents are defecting, continue exploiting; if they're cooperating, exploit their efforts.
- **Endgame Focus:** In later rounds, prioritize immediate gains to maximize total payoff.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to both opponent actions and current game state, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting opponents while ensuring sustainable resource use. The strategy adapts based on opponents' behavior and current stock levels, focusing on maximizing individual payoff.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate to observe opponents' tendencies.
2. **Assess Opponents**: Track defection rates to predict future actions.
3. **Stock Thresholds**: Cooperate if the stock is below a critical level (e.g., 50%) to prevent depletion.
4. **Exploitation**: Defect when others cooperate and stock is sufficiently high.
5. **Endgame Play**: Increase defection in the final rounds to maximize immediate gains.

### Decision Rules

- **First Few Rounds (t < initial_rounds)**: Cooperate to gather data on opponents' strategies.
- **General Play**:
  - If most opponents are defecting, also Defect to avoid exploitation.
  - If opponents cooperate, Exploit by Defecting.
  - Always Cooperate if stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) to prevent crashes.
- **Endgame (last 10% rounds)**: Prioritize Defection to maximize immediate payoffs.

    critical_stock = 0.5 * capacity
    endgame_trigger = 0.9  # Last 10% of rounds

    return defect_rates
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by Cooperating to gather information about opponents' behaviors.
- **Opponent Assessment**: It calculates defection rates from past actions to predict future moves, enabling exploitation when others cooperate.
- **Stock Management**: A critical stock level ensures cooperation prevents resource depletion. This threshold can be adjusted based on game parameters and testing outcomes.
- **Endgame Adjustment**: In the final rounds, defecting maximizes immediate gains since future payoffs are less significant.

This strategy dynamically adapts to opponents' behaviors and current game states, balancing exploitation with sustainability to maximize individual payoff in a competitive environment.

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Early Rounds (t < r/2):**
   - Defect more frequently when the stock is high to gain immediate payoffs.
   - Use a higher threshold for defecting, e.g., if stock S > 80% of capacity.

2. **Middle Rounds (r/2 ≤ t < 3r/4):**
   - Balance between current gains and future sustainability.
   - Cooperate more if the stock is low or if many opponents are defecting to prevent rapid depletion.

3. **Late Rounds (t ≥ 3r/4):**
   - Defect as much as possible since future rounds are limited, prioritizing immediate payoff over stock preservation.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round (t=1):** Default to defecting if S is high (e.g., >70% capacity) to maximize initial payoff.
  
- **Last Round (t=r):** Always defect since there's no future impact.

- **Stock Near Capacity or Depletion:**
  - If S near capacity, defect to exploit abundance.
  - If S low, cooperate to preserve for potential future rounds.

### **Summary:**

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with adaptive preservation based on the game's state and opponents' behavior. It prioritizes defecting in early rounds when stock is abundant, cooperates when necessary to prevent collapse, and defects aggressively in late rounds for maximum payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_160 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff through strategic exploitation while preserving the resource to ensure future gains.

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Purpose: Test opponents' reactions and maximize initial payoff.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Evaluate current stock (`S`) relative to capacity.
   
   a. **High Stock (S > 75% of capacity):**
      - **Action:** Defect if more than 60% of opponents Cooperated in the last round. Otherwise, Cooperate.
      - Rationale: Exploit Cooperators when safe; prevent rapid depletion.

   b. **Moderate Stock (25% < S ≤ 75% capacity):**
      - **Action:** Defect if Cooperators > 60%; else, Cooperate to encourage resource recovery.

   c. **Low Stock (S ≤ 25% capacity):**
      - **Action:** Cooperate.
      - Rationale: Preserve the stock for future rounds.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**

### **Adaptation to Opponent Behavior:**

- Track opponents' cooperation rates over recent rounds.
- If a significant increase in defection is detected, switch strategies towards Cooperating to prevent mutual exploitation and resource collapse.

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Initial Stock (S = capacity):** Start with Defect to test and exploit.
- **Stock Depletion:** If stock drops critically, prioritize Cooperation to allow recovery.
- **Unpredictable Opponent Behavior:** Maintain flexibility by adjusting actions based on observed trends in cooperation.

### **Conclusion:**

This strategy balances exploitation with preservation, adapting to both the current state of the resource and opponents' behaviors. By exploiting when safe and preserving when necessary, it maximizes long-term payoff while mitigating risks of mutual defection and resource collapse.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_161 = '''
To address this problem, we can employ a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with the preservation of the resource for future rounds. The strategy involves using thresholds based on the current stock level and the number of remaining rounds.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine Thresholds:**
   - Establish an initial threshold (e.g., 0.7) to decide when to defect based on the current stock relative to capacity.
   - Adjust this threshold dynamically as the game progresses, lowering it in later rounds to prioritize immediate gains.

2. **Calculate Dynamic Threshold:**
   - For each round `t` out of total rounds `r`, compute the adjusted threshold using:
     \[
     \text{threshold}_t = 0.7 - \left(\frac{t}{r}\right) \times 0.2
     \]
     This ensures that as the game nears its end, the threshold decreases, making you more willing to defect even at lower stock levels.

3. **Make Decision:**
   - In each round, compare the current stock `S` with the computed threshold.
   - If `S > threshold_t`, defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to preserve the resource for future rounds.

**Algorithm:**

- Initialize total_rounds = r
- For each round t from 1 to r:
  - Compute threshold = 0.7 - (t / r) * 0.2
  - If current_stock > threshold * capacity:
      - Choose Defect
  - Else:
      - Choose Cooperate

**Answer:**

Based on this strategy, the decision in each round is determined by comparing the current stock level against a dynamically adjusted threshold. The algorithm prioritizes defecting when the stock is sufficiently high or as the game progresses towards its end.

\boxed{\text{Defect if current stock exceeds } 0.7 - \left(\frac{\text{current round}}{\text{total rounds}}\right) \times 0.2 \text{ of capacity, else Cooperate.}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_162 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we can outline a structured strategy that balances exploiting high resource levels while preserving resources when necessary. This strategy adapts dynamically based on observed changes in resource levels across rounds.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Early Rounds (First r - 10 Rounds):**
   - **Defect** if the current stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
   - **Cooperate** if the stock is below this threshold to help preserve resources for future rounds.

2. **Adaptive Behavior:**
   - After each round, monitor the change in stock levels.
   - If the stock decreases by more than a significant percentage (e.g., 20%) from the previous round, switch to cooperating in the next round to prevent further depletion.
   - Continue this adaptive approach until the final few rounds.

3. **Final Rounds:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds (e.g., rounds 15-20 for a total of 20 rounds), defect regardless of the stock level to maximize immediate gains, as there are no future rounds left to consider.

### Rationale:

- **Early Exploitation:** By defecting when resources are abundant, you maximize your immediate gain while the resource can still sustain it.
- **Adaptive Preservation:** Monitoring stock trends allows for a switch to cooperation when necessary, preventing rapid depletion caused by excessive defection from other players.
- **Final Round Maximization:** Defecting in the final rounds ensures that you capitalize on any remaining resources without worrying about future consequences.

### Conclusion:

This strategy balances between exploiting resources when beneficial and preserving them when necessary, adapting dynamically to changes observed across rounds. It aims to optimize total payoff by considering both immediate gains and future sustainability.

**Final Answer:**

To maximize your total payoff while balancing exploitation and preservation of the resource, follow this adaptive strategy:

- **Early Rounds:** Defect if the stock is above 75% capacity; cooperate otherwise.
- **Monitor Trends:** Switch to cooperating in subsequent rounds if the stock decreases by over 20% from the previous round.
- **Final Rounds:** Defect regardless of the stock level in the last few rounds.

This approach ensures you exploit resources when advantageous and adapt to prevent over-depletion, leading to an optimal total payoff.

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_163 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to maximize our own payoff while considering the impact of others' actions. The strategy should adapt dynamically based on stock levels and historical player behavior.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to assess others' behaviors without immediate depletion.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Monitor the stock level relative to capacity.
   - Track the proportion of defects from other players in previous rounds.
3. **Decision Rules**:
   - Defect if the stock is above 70% of capacity and more than 30% of players have defected in past rounds, exploiting others' potential cooperation or defection.
   - Cooperate if the stock is below 70% to prevent further depletion.
4. **Final Round**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Cooperate (`C`) to establish a baseline.
- **Middle Rounds** (2 to r-1):
  - If current stock is below 70% of capacity: Cooperate (`C`).
  - Else, if the proportion of defects in previous rounds exceeds 30%: Defect (`D`).
  - Otherwise: Cooperate (`C`).
- **Last Round (r)**: Always Defect (`D`) to maximize payoff.

### Pseudocode:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history_of_actions):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        total_defects = sum(history_of_actions)
        defect_proportion = total_defects / ((round_number - 1) * n)

        if stock_level < 0.7 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif defect_proportion > 0.3:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to avoid early depletion, allowing observation of others' strategies.
- **Stock Threshold (70%)**: Ensures the resource remains sustainable by cooperating when stock is low, preventing collapse.
- **Defection Proportion (30%)**: Exploits situations where enough players are defecting, maximizing immediate gains while considering potential future impacts.
- **Final Round Defection**: Secures maximum payoff in the last round without worrying about future consequences.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to both the current state and historical behavior of other players.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 3-5 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff while signaling others to consider cooperation.

2. **Middle Rounds (From round 6 onwards):**
   - **Action:** Observe opponents' strategies.
     - If most defect, switch to Cooperate (C) to prevent stock depletion.
     - If cooperation is high, continue Defecting (D) to exploit.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 3-5 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Encourage others to cooperate, maintaining stock for consistent payoffs.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Track opponents' cooperation rate.
     - High cooperation: Defect more.
     - High defection: Cooperate more.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always defect.
   - **Low Stock (below 30%):** Cooperate heavily.
   - **High Stock (above 70%):** Defect more.

6. **Sustainability Check:**
   - After each round, if stock is low (<30%), increase cooperation to prevent collapse.

7. **Opponent Modeling:**
   - Predict future moves based on past actions; adjust strategy accordingly.

This adaptive strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by exploiting others' behaviors and adjusting actions dynamically.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Reason: Maximizes immediate payoff, assuming some opponents may cooperate.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the proportion of defects from opponents in previous rounds.
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
   
   - **Decision Rules:**
     a. If the proportion of defects exceeds 50% or the current stock is below 30% of capacity:
        - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
          - Reason: Prevents further depletion and promotes sustainable resource levels for future rounds.
     b. Else:
        - **Action:** Defect (D)
          - Reason: Exploits opponents who are cooperating, maximizing immediate payoff.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Reason: No future rounds to consider; prioritize maximum immediate payoff.

4. **Dynamic Thresholds and Adjustments:**
   - The strategy dynamically adjusts based on opponent behavior and stock levels.
   - If the stock is high, defecting is safer as growth can replenish it quickly.
   - Low stock triggers cooperation to prevent collapse.

# Special case for the last round
if round_number == r:
    return 'D'

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Defect to exploit potential cooperators.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
- **Low Stock Scenario:** Switches to Cooperate if stock drops below 30% of capacity, preventing resource collapse.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically based on opponents' behavior and the current state of the common pool resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_166 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a strategic approach that balances exploitation and cooperation based on the current stock level and historical actions of other players. The strategy aims to maximize immediate payoffs while considering the sustainability of the resource for higher future gains.

### Approach
1. **First Round:** Start by defecting to maximize immediate payoff.
2. **Last Round:** Defect again to secure maximum possible payoff in the final round.
3. **Middle Rounds:**
   - If the current stock is below 25% of capacity, switch to cooperation to encourage regrowth for future rounds.
   - Track the percentage of other players who defected in the previous round:
     - If more than 60% of other players defected last round, cooperate to prevent further depletion and promote regrowth.
     - Otherwise, defect if others are mostly cooperating to exploit their strategy.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(history, current_round, total_rounds, num_players):
    # Extract the current stock level (assuming it's available; adjust based on actual input)
    # For this example, let's assume history includes stock levels
    if current_round == 0:
        return 'Defect'
    
    if current_round == total_rounds - 1:
        return 'Defect'
    
    # Get the last known stock level (adjust based on actual data structure)
    # Assuming history[-1] contains info about previous round's stock
    last_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    capacity = 100  # Replace with actual capacity if available
    
    # Check if current stock is critically low
    if last_stock < 0.25 * capacity:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # Calculate the percentage of other players who defected in the previous round
    prev_defects = sum(1 for action in history[-1]['actions'] if action == 'Defect')
    defect_percent = (prev_defects / num_players) * 100
    
    # If a high number of players defected last round, switch to cooperate
    if defect_percent > 60:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # Otherwise, exploit by defecting
    return 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
- **First and Last Rounds:** The strategy begins and ends with defecting to maximize immediate payoffs.
- **Low Stock Threshold:** When the stock drops below 25% of capacity, cooperation is prioritized to encourage regrowth, ensuring higher potential payoffs in future rounds.
- **Defection Tracking:** By monitoring the percentage of other players who defected in the previous round, the strategy adapts. If a significant majority (over 60%) defected, it switches to cooperation to mitigate further depletion and promote resource recovery.

This approach ensures that exploitation is balanced with sustainable practices when necessary, aiming to maximize the player's payoff while considering the long-term health of the shared resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_167 = '''
To determine whether to cooperate or defect as an AI designed to exploit the situation without causing immediate collapse, follow these steps:

1. **Assess the Current Stock Level (S):** Determine how much of the resource is currently available.

2. **Determine the Threshold:** Calculate half of the maximum possible stock capacity (C/2).

3. **Make a Decision:**
   - If S > C/2, choose to **defect** because exploiting the resource at this level allows for higher immediate gains while still allowing growth to sustain future levels.
   - If S ≤ C/2, choose to **cooperate** to help maintain or rebuild the stock.

4. **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously track the trend of the stock. If defecting leads to a significant decrease in future stock levels despite being above the threshold, reconsider switching back to cooperating to prevent long-term depletion.

**Final Decision:**

If the current stock level is more than half of its maximum capacity, defect to maximize immediate gain while allowing growth to sustain it. Otherwise, cooperate to maintain or increase the stock.

$\boxed{\text{Defect if current stock > C/2; else, Cooperate}}$

description_EXPLOITATIVE_168 = '''
### Strategy Overview:

The strategy aims to exploit others by initially Cooperating to build trust, then defecting when others are likely to Cooperate. It adapts based on opponents' actions and stock levels.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

- **Early Rounds (First X rounds):** Cooperate to encourage others to do the same.
- **Exploitation Phase:** After the initial phase, Defect if most players have been Cooperating recently.
- **Adaptation:** If too many are Defecting, switch back to Cooperating to preserve stock.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

- **First Round:** Cooperate to signal willingness to collaborate.
- **Last Rounds (Final Y rounds):** Focus on maximizing immediate payoffs by defecting if others Cooperate; else, Cooperate minimally.

---

### 3. Exploitative Mindset

Encourage Cooperation from others so you can Defect and gain higher payoffs when they least expect it.

---

### Pseudocode:

```python
for each round:
    if current_round < early_coop_rounds:
        play C
    else:
        recent_opponent_actions = get_opponents_actions(last_k_rounds)
        total_defectors = count D in recent_opponent_actions
        
        if total_defectors > threshold:
            play C
        else:
            if stock_level > safe_stock_threshold:
                play D  # Exploit while others Cooperate
            else:
                play C  # Preserve what's left
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Early Rounds:** Initial Cooperation builds a pattern that may encourage others to Cooperate.
- **Exploitation Phase:** After trust is built, defect when others are likely to Cooperate for higher immediate gain.
- **Adaptation:** Monitor opponents' actions; if too many Defect, switch back to Cooperating to avoid stock collapse and ensure future exploitation opportunities.

---

### Implementation Notes:

- Set `early_coop_rounds` (e.g., 2-3) based on expected game length.
- Define `last_k_rounds` for recent opponent action analysis (e.g., last 5 rounds).
- Determine `threshold` of Defectors beyond which it's safer to Cooperate (e.g., 10% of players).
- Establish a `safe_stock_threshold` to avoid sudden stock depletion.

---

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with adaptive preservation, allowing for robust performance across various opponent behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
Maximize total payoff by exploiting opponents' behavior while balancing resource sustainability.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Defect to test opponents' reactions and maximize immediate gains.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **Current Stock Analysis:**
      - Calculate the current stock level \( S \).
      - Determine thresholds:
        - Upper threshold (\( U \)) = 70% of capacity.
        - Lower threshold (\( L \)) = 50% of capacity.

   b. **Opponents' Behavior:**
      - Track opponents' actions (Cooperate/Defect) in recent rounds, with emphasis on newer data.
      - Calculate the proportion of Cooperators (\( C_p \)) among opponents.

   c. **Strategy Selection:**
      - If \( S > U \) and \( C_p \) is high (>60%), defect to exploit cooperation.
      - If \( S < L \) or \( C_p \) is low (<40%), cooperate to prevent collapse.
      - For intermediate stock levels, use a mix based on historical trends.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Increase \( U \) by 2% if stock has grown in the past round.
   - Decrease \( U \) by 2% if stock has declined.
   - Keep \( L \) fixed at 50% unless stock trends indicate a need for adjustment.

4. **Last Few Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - Defect aggressively to maximize immediate payoffs, as there's no future benefit beyond the last round.

**Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always defect to test opponents.
- **Low Stock Levels (<50% capacity):** Switch to cooperation to allow regrowth for potential future exploitation.
- **High Stock Levels (>70% capacity):** Exploit by defecting, as the resource can sustain consumption without immediate collapse.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(history):
    # Initial rounds: defect
    if history.round < 3:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate current stock and thresholds
    S = history.stock[-1]
    capacity = history.parameters.capacity
    U = min(0.7 * capacity, 0.9 * capacity)
    L = max(0.5 * capacity, 0.2 * capacity)
    
    # Track opponents' cooperation proportion
    recent_rounds = 5  # Focus on last few rounds for quicker adaptation
    coop_count = sum(1 for action in history.opponent_actions[-recent_rounds:] if action == 'C')
    total_opponents = len(history.opponent_actions[0])
    C_p = coop_count / (total_opponents * recent_rounds)
    
    # Dynamic threshold adjustment based on stock trend
    if S > history.stock[-2]:  # Stock increased
        U += 0.02 * capacity
    else:  # Stock decreased or stable
        U -= 0.02 * capacity
    
    # Ensure thresholds are within bounds
    U = min(U, 0.9 * capacity)
    L = max(L, 0.3 * capacity)
    
    # Strategy selection
    if S > U and C_p > 0.6:
        return 'D'
    elif S < L or C_p < 0.4:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Mix based on recent trends (e.g., weighted towards defecting if stock is stable)
        if history.stock[-1] >= history.stock[-2]:
            return 'D'
        else:

# Example usage
history = GameHistory(stock=[80, 75, 70], opponent_actions=[['C', 'D'], ['D', 'D']], parameters={'capacity': 100})
action = decide_action(history)
print(action)  # Output: 'D' or 'C'

**Conclusion:**  
This strategy dynamically adjusts to exploit opponents while ensuring resource sustainability. By balancing immediate gains with long-term preservation, it aims to maximize total payoff over multiple rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_170 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, an adaptive and exploitative strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' behaviors while maintaining resource sustainability. The strategy dynamically adjusts based on stock levels, opponents' actions, and round progression.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round Approach:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Reasoning:** Start with a neutral move to gather information about opponents without risking immediate depletion of the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Assess Opponents' Behavior:**
     - Track how often each opponent has Cooperated or Defected in recent rounds.
     - If opponents are mostly Cooperating, exploit by defecting (D) to gain higher payoff.
   - **Evaluate Stock Dynamics:**
     - Monitor the current stock level and its trend over time.
     - If the stock is low or decreasing, Cooperate to preserve resources for future rounds.
     - If the stock is high and stable, Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Round Progression Consideration:**
   - In later rounds (approaching round r), prioritize defecting to exploit the resource before it's too late, as future rounds have less impact on total payoff.

### Decision Rules

- **Cooperate Conditions:**
  - When opponents are defecting frequently, indicating a risk of resource collapse.
  - If stock is low or showing a decreasing trend over time.
  - Early rounds with no clear pattern from others to test the environment.

- **Defect Conditions:**
  - When most opponents are Cooperating, allowing exploitation for higher payoff.
  - If stock is high and stable, defecting won't lead to immediate collapse.
  - In later rounds where future payoffs are less significant.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round:** Default to Cooperate to gather initial information.
- **Last Round (t = r):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future impacts.
- **Stock Near Extremes:**
  - If near zero, Cooperate to allow regrowth.
  - At capacity, Defect safely as growth can maintain the resource.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
def decide_action(opponents_history, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    cooperation_counts = count_cooperations(opponents_history)
    defection_counts = count_defections(opponents_history)
    
    stock_trend = assess_stock_trend(current_stock)
    
    if cooperation_counts > defection_counts * 2 and current_stock >= (capacity / 2):
        # Exploit cooperators
        return 'D'
    elif current_stock <= (capacity * 0.3) or stock_trend == 'decreasing':
        # Preserve resource
        return 'C'
    elif round_number > total_rounds - 5:
        # Last few rounds, exploit for immediate gain
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Mix based on current state
        if random.random() < 0.7 and cooperation_counts >= defection_counts:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Strategy Justification

- **Exploitation:** The strategy exploits opponents by defecting when they Cooperate, maximizing immediate gains.
- **Sustainability:** By Cooperating when the stock is low or decreasing, it ensures long-term resource availability, preventing mutual defection leading to collapse.
- **Adaptability:** The strategy adapts dynamically based on real-time data about opponents and resource levels, ensuring optimal decisions in varying scenarios.

This approach balances exploitation with sustainability, aiming to outperform a wide range of opponent strategies in the tournament.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_171 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting others' cooperative behavior while ensuring sustainability of the resource. The strategy adapts based on observed actions and current stock levels.

### Strategy Description:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 3):**
   - Cooperate to build a cooperative baseline and observe opponents' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Check:** Use a threshold (e.g., capacity * 0.5) to decide.
     - If the stock is above this threshold, defect if opponents have cooperated sufficiently in recent rounds.
     - Otherwise, cooperate to allow resource recovery.
   - **Opponent Behavior Tracking:** Monitor past actions to determine cooperation rates.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Always defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, opponent_actions):
    # Parameters
    threshold = capacity * 0.5
    initial_coop_rounds = 3
    recent_rounds = 10  # Adjust as needed

    if round_number <= initial_coop_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check stock level
    if current_stock > threshold:
        # Calculate opponent cooperation rate in recent rounds
        recent_opponent_actions = opponent_actions[-recent_rounds:]
        coop_count = sum(1 for actions in recent_opponent_actions for a in actions if a == 'C')
        total_actions = len(recent_opponent_actions) * n
        coop_rate = coop_count / total_actions
        
        # Exploit if opponents are mostly Cooperating
        if coop_rate > 0.6:
            return 'D'
    
    # Otherwise, Cooperate to allow stock recovery
    return 'C'

# Special case for last round
if round_number == r:
    return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by cooperating in the first few rounds to observe others and build a cooperative baseline.
- **Dynamic Thresholding:** Uses a threshold based on capacity to decide when defecting is safe. If the stock is high, it exploits opponents who are likely to cooperate.
- **Opponent Behavior Adaptation:** Tracks how many opponents have cooperated recently. If cooperation rates are high, it defects; otherwise, it continues cooperating to prevent resource collapse.
- **Last Round Exploitation:** Defects in the last round to maximize payoff without worrying about future rounds.

This strategy effectively balances exploitation and sustainability, adapting to different opponent behaviors while ensuring long-term viability when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_172 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing immediate payoffs while considering the game's dynamics to ensure future exploitation opportunities. The strategy adapts based on observed stock levels and consumption patterns.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Exploitation:** Start by defecting in early rounds to maximize immediate gains.
2. **Stock Monitoring:** After each round, assess if the stock has dropped significantly or if total consumption was high.
3. **Conservation Phase:** If the stock is too low or consumption is excessive, switch to cooperation to allow recovery.
4. **Resume Exploitation:** Once the stock recovers sufficiently, return to defecting.
5. **Final Exploitation:** In the last few rounds, defect as much as possible without concern for future impact.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round:** Defect to maximize payoff.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate previous total consumption and stock level after consumption.
   - If either the stock is below a low threshold (e.g., 30% capacity) or total consumption was unusually high, cooperate this round.
   - Otherwise, defect.
3. **Stock Recovery:** After switching to cooperation, monitor when the stock rises above a higher threshold (e.g., 60%) and resume defecting.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(round_number, remaining_rounds, previous_stock, current_stock, total_consumption):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        # Define thresholds
        low_threshold = 0.3 * initial_capacity
        high_threshold = 0.6 * initial_capacity
        
        # Check conditions for switching to cooperation
        if current_stock < low_threshold or total_consumption > (n * D_consume):
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            # Switch back to defecting if stock has recovered sufficiently
            if previous_round_action == "Cooperate" and current_stock > high_threshold:
                return "Defect"
            else:
                return "Defect"
    # For the last few rounds, prioritize defecting
    if remaining_rounds <= 0.25 * total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Exploitation:** The strategy begins by exploiting the common pool to gain immediate benefits.
- **Monitoring and Adaptation:** By observing stock levels and consumption, the strategy adapts to prevent complete collapse, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.
- **Balanced Approach:** It balances between maximizing current payoffs and maintaining enough resources for continued gains in subsequent rounds.

This approach ensures that we exploit while conserving enough to sustain future exploitation, providing a strategic balance in the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_173 = '''
To determine whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock level, set two thresholds: D_high = 0.8 × capacity and D_low = 0.2 × capacity. 

- **If the current stock (S) is above D_high**, defect to maximize immediate gains.
- **If S is below D_high but above D_low**, cooperate to sustain the resource for future rounds.
- **If S is below D_low**, continue cooperating to allow regrowth.

**Answer:**

The strategy involves setting two thresholds based on capacity. When the stock exceeds 80% of capacity, defect to gain more immediately. Cooperate otherwise to preserve or regenerate resources. The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Defect when stock > } 0.8 \times \text{capacity; else cooperate}}}

description_EXPLOITATIVE_174 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we'll outline a strategic approach that balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability. This strategy will guide decisions based on the current state of the resource, historical behavior, and future implications.

### Approach
1. **Initial Exploration**: Begin by testing the waters with a defection to gauge others' responses.
2. **Sustainability Check**: If defecting leads to significant depletion, switch to cooperation to preserve resources for future exploitation.
3. **Adaptive Behavior**: Adjust actions based on opponents' past behavior—defect if they cooperate, and cooperate if many defect to prevent over-depletion.
4. **Final Round Maximization**: In the last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The strategy initializes with parameters for the number of players, capacity of the resource, and total rounds. It also keeps track of the current round and historical data on opponents' defection counts.
- **First Round**: Begins by defecting to test others' initial behavior.
- **Subsequent Rounds**: Evaluates based on the current stock level and previous rounds:
  - If the stock is above a threshold (70% of capacity), it defects if fewer than half of players did so in the last round, else cooperates.
  - If the stock is below the threshold, it cooperates to prevent further depletion.
- **Last Round**: Always defects to maximize final payoff without regard for future sustainability.

This approach ensures a balance between exploiting the resource when safe and preserving it when necessary, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior and current conditions.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Justification: Start by defecting to test the water and observe opponents' initial moves.

2. **Subsequent Rounds: Observation and Adaptation**
   - **Calculate Average Consumption Threshold:**
     - Determine an average consumption threshold based on historical data from previous rounds.
     - If the stock remains above a set percentage (e.g., 70% of capacity), continue defecting as it indicates sustainable exploitation.

3. **Adaptive Defection and Cooperation:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:**
     - If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to Cooperate (C) for a limited number of rounds to prevent depletion.
     - This helps in preserving the resource, allowing future exploitation.

4. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - **Identify Persistent Defectors:**
     - If opponents continue defecting despite stock depletion, respond by defecting more aggressively.
     - The goal is to exacerbate the situation for others while maximizing immediate gains.

5. **Final Rounds Handling:**
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20% of total rounds):**
     - Switch to defecting exclusively to maximize payoffs without concern for future sustainability.

6. **Edge Cases and Adjustments:**
   - **Unexpected Changes:** If opponents suddenly change strategies or stock growth is unexpected, adjust thresholds and response times accordingly.
   - **Resilience:** The strategy adapts dynamically, ensuring it remains effective against various opponent behaviors without relying on specific patterns.

**Decision Rules Summary:**

- **Start with Defection:** Begin by defecting to observe opponents' reactions.
- **Adapt Based on Stock Health:** Continue defecting if stock is stable; switch to cooperate temporarily if depletion occurs.
- **Punish Persistent Defectors:** Exploit more when others cause rapid depletion, maximizing short-term gains.
- **Maximize in Final Rounds:** Switch to defecting exclusively in the final rounds for maximum payoff.

This strategy balances exploitation with strategic cooperation when necessary, ensuring long-term payoff maximization while adapting to various opponent tactics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_176 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting opponents while considering the game dynamics. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start with cooperation in the first round to encourage sustainability and observe opponent behaviors.
2. **Defection Thresholds:** Monitor recent opponent actions and stock levels to decide when to defect. Defect if too many opponents are defecting or if the stock is low.
3. **Last Round Exploitation:** Always defect in the last round to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate to maintain a healthy stock and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Track the number of defectors in recent rounds (e.g., last 5).
   - Calculate the percentage of defectors relative to total players.
   - Defect if:
     - The percentage of defectors exceeds a threshold (e.g., 10%).
     - The stock falls below a low threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity).
   - Otherwise, cooperate.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Defect to exploit the remaining resource without regard for future sustainability.

### Handling Edge Cases:
- **High Stock (>75%):** Cooperate as long-term gains are sustainable.
- **Moderate Stock (25%-75%):** Cooperate unless defectors exceed thresholds, indicating exploitation.
- **Low Stock (<25%):** Defect to maximize immediate gain before potential crash.

### Exploitative Aspect:
- By defecting when enough opponents do, the strategy exploits their behavior, maximizing personal payoff while potentially accelerating resource depletion.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Initialize counters for tracking opponent defection history.
2. For each round, apply the decision rules based on current and historical data.
3. Adjust thresholds dynamically if necessary to optimize exploitation.

This strategy adaptively balances exploitation with consideration of game dynamics, ensuring robust performance across varying opponent behaviors and resource states.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_177 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' behavior while adapting dynamically. Here's the structured approach:

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Rounds (First 3-5 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Purpose: Build a baseline of cooperation and observe other players' initial moves.

2. **Middle Rounds (From round 6 to r-10):**
   - **Action:** Observe the number of Cooperators (C) and Defectors (D) in the past 3 rounds.
     - If more than X% of players defect, switch to Defect to exploit the resource before it depletes.
     - If less than X% defect, continue Cooperating to encourage others to provide a higher stock for future exploitation.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 5-10 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Purpose: Exploit the remaining stock maximally as there's no future punishment.

### Thresholds and Adjustments:
- **Threshold X%:** Dynamically adjust based on observed defection rates in recent rounds. Initially set at around 40%, adjusting higher if stock remains stable or lower if it depletes quickly.
- **Stock Consideration:**
  - If the current stock is high, increase the tendency to Defect.
  - If low, consider Cooperating more to conserve and allow recovery.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    capacity = maximum_sustainable_level

    # Early rounds: Cooperate to observe others
    if round_number <= 5:
        return 'C'

    # Determine recent defection rate
    recent_defectors = sum(1 for actions in history[-3:] for action in actions if action == 'D')
    total_recent_actions = len(history) * n
    defection_rate = recent_defectors / total_recent_actions

    # Threshold adjustment based on stock health
    if current_stock > capacity * 0.7:
        threshold = max(40, (defection_rate * 100))
    else:
        threshold = min(60, (defection_rate * 100))

    # Middle rounds: Adapt based on defection rate
    if round_number <= r - 5:
        if defection_rate > threshold / 100:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

    # Last few rounds: Exploit maximally
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage:
# history contains the actions of all players from previous rounds
# current_stock is the state before this round
# action = decide_action(current_round, history, current_stock)
```

### Explanation:
- **Early Rounds:** Start by Cooperating to gauge others' strategies.
- **Middle Rounds:** Adapt based on recent defection rates. If many defect, exploit; if few, encourage cooperation for future gains.
- **Final Rounds:** Defect maximally as the game nears conclusion.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with sustainable play, adapting dynamically to maximize individual payoff while considering others' behaviors and stock dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_178 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Objective:**
   - Maximize cumulative payoff by exploiting opponents' behaviors while maintaining resource sustainability.

2. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Reasoning: Gain maximum immediate payoff and signal potential exploitability.

3. **Adaptive Strategy Post Initial Round:**
   - **Threshold T:** Set as a fraction of capacity (e.g., 30%).
   - For each subsequent round:
     - Observe opponents' actions from the previous round.
     - Calculate current stock level relative to threshold T.

4. **Decision Rules Based on Current Stock and Opponent Actions:**
   - **If Stock > T:**
     - If majority of opponents Defected last round, continue to Defect to exploit their behavior.
     - Else (significant cooperation observed), switch to Cooperate to encourage resource sustainability.
   - **If Stock ≤ T:**
     - Switch to Cooperate to aid in resource recovery and prevent collapse.

5. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Track opponents' actions using a moving average or proportion of Cooperates/Defects.
   - Adjust threshold T dynamically based on observed stock growth rates and rounds remaining.

6. **Last Few Rounds (Rounds r-2, r-1, r):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Reasoning: No future consequences; exploit for maximum immediate gain.

7. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If all opponents Cooperate early on, defect to exploit.
   - If stock is near capacity and opponents Cooperate, consider Cooperating to maintain resource health.

8. **Pseudocode Outline:**

```pseudocode
Initialize threshold T = 0.3 * capacity
for each round from 1 to r:
    if round == 1:
        action = Defect
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        opponent_actions = get_opponent_actions()
        
        # Calculate proportion of opponents who Defected last round
        defected_proportion = count(opponent_actions where action == D) / n
        
        if current_stock > T:
            if defected_proportion > 0.5:
                action = Defect
            else:
                action = Cooperate
        else:
            action = Cooperate
    
    # Execute the action and observe outcomes for next round's decision-making
```

9. **Considerations:**
   - Monitor stock level and adjust T to prevent oscillations or resource collapse.
   - Incorporate unpredictability in actions to counteract opponent anticipation.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors and resource conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_179 = '''
To address the problem, we need to determine a balanced strategy between exploiting the resource when it's abundant and conserving it when it's scarce. The goal is to maximize long-term benefits without depleting the resource.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Resource State:**
   - Continuously monitor the current stock level of the shared resource relative to its maximum capacity.

2. **Set Thresholds for Exploitation and Conservation:**
   - Establish a threshold, such as 70% of the maximum capacity, above which exploitation is encouraged.
   - Below this threshold, conservation efforts are prioritized to allow the resource to replenish.

3. **Decision-Making Based on Current Stock Level:**
   - **Exploitation Phase (Current Stock > Threshold):** Engage in actions that maximize immediate gains from the resource.
   - **Conservation Phase (Current Stock ≤ Threshold):** Take steps to minimize consumption and support resource recovery.

4. **Monitor and Adjust Strategies:**
   - Regularly assess the impact of current strategies on the resource's health and adjust thresholds or behaviors as needed based on observed trends.

5. **Implement Feedback Loops:**
   - Use data from past rounds to inform future decisions, ensuring that actions adapt dynamically to changing conditions.

**Answer:**

To balance exploitation and conservation effectively:

- When the current stock is above 70% of the maximum capacity, adopt an **exploitation strategy** by defecting (choosing a course of action that benefits from the abundant resource).
- When the current stock drops to or below 70%, switch to a **conservation strategy** by cooperating (supporting actions that help sustain or increase the resource for future rounds).

This approach ensures that we maximize short-term gains when resources are plentiful while safeguarding against long-term depletion. 

$\boxed{\text{Defect if current stock is above 70% of capacity; otherwise, cooperate.}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_180 = '''
The exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize individual payoffs by balancing exploitation of the resource and preservation for future rounds. The strategy adapts based on the current stock level, number of rounds remaining, and observed history of other players' actions.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Early Rounds (Not in Last Few Rounds):**
   - If the current stock is above a threshold (e.g., 1.5n), defect to gain higher immediate payoff while allowing the resource to recover.
   - If the current stock is below this threshold, cooperate to preserve the resource for future rounds.

2. **Later Rounds (Last Third of Total Rounds):**
   - Regardless of the stock level, defect to maximize immediate gains as there's limited time left for recovery.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to observe others' behavior and maintain a stable stock.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Always defect to exploit the remaining resource without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    threshold = 1.5 * n  # Example threshold
    last_few_rounds_threshold = total_rounds - (total_rounds // 3)
    
    if round_number > last_few_rounds_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Threshold Calculation:** The threshold is set at 1.5n to allow defecting when the stock can sustain higher consumption without risking depletion.
- **Last Few Rounds Adjustment:** In the last third of rounds, defecting ensures maximum immediate payoff, as there's insufficient time for recovery.
- **First Round Behavior:** Starting with cooperation helps maintain a stable resource level and provides insight into others' strategies.

This strategy allows for exploitation while managing risk by preserving the resource when necessary. It adapts dynamically based on game state and remaining rounds to maximize individual payoffs.

To maximize your own payoff regardless of others', always choose to defect. This prioritizes immediate gains even if it leads to long-term depletion of the resource.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Reasoning:** Avoid rapid depletion early on to set a sustainable base for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**

### **Summary:**

This strategy starts by cooperating to build a sustainable base, exploits when others cooperate heavily, and adapts based on stock levels. In the final rounds, it maximizes immediate gains through defecting. The balance between exploitation and cooperation ensures long-term sustainability while maximizing personal payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_184 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting others' cooperative behavior while maintaining a sustainable resource level. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to observe opponents' behavior and understand stock dynamics without immediate risk.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Track the proportion of other players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - If more than 50% of opponents cooperated, defect to exploit their cooperation.
   - If 50% or fewer cooperated, cooperate to avoid mutual defection and potential stock depletion.

3. **Stock Level Adjustment:**
   - Increase likelihood to defect if the stock is above 70% of capacity.
   - Decrease likelihood to defect if the stock is below this threshold to help sustain resources.

4. **Final Rounds (Last Third):** Always defect to maximize immediate gains as the game nears its end.

### Decision Rules

- **Cooperate:** When opponents' cooperation is low or when stock levels are low.
- **Defect:** When a majority of opponents cooperate, especially if the stock is high.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to gather initial data.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Switch to always Defecting to exploit remaining resources without concern for future rounds.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate more frequently to avoid rapid depletion and ensure some resource recovery.

### Exploitation Mechanism

By defecting when opponents cooperate, the strategy manipulates others into sustaining the resource while the exploiter gains more. This approach adapts based on observed behavior and stock conditions, aiming to maximize payoff while mitigating risks of mutual defection leading to resource collapse.

### Pseudocode Summary

```
function decide_action(round_number, previous_actions, current_stock):
    if round_number == 1:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        opponent_cooperate_proportion = calculate_opponent_cooperate(previous_actions)
        stock_threshold = capacity * 0.7
        
        if round_number in last_third_rounds(r):
            return Defect
        elif current_stock > stock_threshold and opponent_cooperate_proportion > 0.5:
            return Defect
        else:
            return Cooperate
```

This strategy adaptively exploits others' behavior while considering the state of the common pool resource, aiming to maximize long-term gains through strategic cooperation and defection.

1. **First Round:**
   - Action: Defect (D)
     - Rationale: High initial stock allows higher payoff with minimal immediate harm, testing others' reactions.

   a. If the current stock is above 30% of capacity:
      i. Determine if more than half of the players defected in the last round.
         - If yes: Action = Defect (D) to exploit while possible.
         - If no: Action = Cooperate (C) to encourage others to continue cooperating, maintaining resource sustainability.
   b. If the current stock is 30% or below:

**Decision Rules Summary:**

- **Initial Move:** Exploit by defecting in the first round.
- **Ongoing Adaptation:** Monitor stock levels and opponents' actions. Defect if others are exploiting (more than half defected) and stock is healthy; otherwise, cooperate to preserve resources.
- **Resource Preservation:** Switch to cooperating when stock drops below 30% to prevent collapse.
- **Final Exploitation:** Defect in the last round for maximum payoff without concern for future consequences.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on game state and opponents' behavior.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' cooperation while maintaining sustainability to ensure long-term gains.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Encourage other players to cooperate, creating an environment conducive to future exploitation by defecting.

2. **Mid Game (Next 50% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Baseline Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Adaptive Rule:** Monitor the stock level after each round.
     - If the stock drops below a dynamically adjusted threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), switch to Cooperate (C) for the next few rounds to allow recovery.
   - **Rationale:** Exploit others' cooperation while ensuring sustainable resource levels to prevent collapse.

3. **Endgame (Last 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize short-term gains without concern for future rounds, as there are no subsequent rounds to benefit from stock preservation.

**Adaptive Mechanisms:**

- **Opponent Behavior Tracking:** Continuously assess the frequency of Cooperate and Defect actions among opponents. If a significant number start defecting, temporarily switch to Cooperate to prevent stock depletion and then exploit when cooperation resumes.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold for switching to Cooperate is adjusted based on historical growth rates and current consumption patterns to maintain optimal resource levels.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to build initial trust and encourage others to cooperate.
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock drops below 30% of capacity, immediately switch to Cooperate for the next two rounds to allow recovery.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Unconditionally Defect in the final 25% of rounds to capitalize on any remaining resources without regard for future sustainability.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, consumption_history):
    # Determine game phase
    early_phase = round_number <= total_rounds * 0.25
    mid_phase = total_rounds * 0.25 < round_number <= total_rounds * 0.75
    late_phase = round_number > total_rounds * 0.75

    # Early phase: Cooperate to build cooperation
    if early_phase:
        return 'C'

    # Late phase: Defect maximally
    elif late_phase:
        return 'D'

    # Mid game: Default to defect, with checks for stock level
    else:
        # Calculate dynamic threshold based on historical growth
        threshold = max(0.3 * capacity, calculate_threshold(consumption_history))
        if current_stock < threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Check opponent behavior; if many defecting, temporarily cooperate
            recent_opponent_defects = sum(action == 'D' for action in consumption_history[-10:])
            if recent_opponent_defects > 0.7 * len(consumption_history):
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

def calculate_threshold(consumption_history):
    # Example calculation based on past trends
    average_growth = sum(history['growth'] for history in consumption_history) / len(consumption_history)
    threshold = 0.3 * capacity + (average_growth if average_growth > 0 else 0)
    return max(threshold, 0.2 * capacity)
```

**Conclusion:** This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by exploiting others' cooperation while adaptively adjusting to maintain resource levels for continued exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_187 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a strategic approach that balances exploiting others' cooperation for immediate gains while ensuring long-term sustainability. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initialization**: Track each player's past actions and stock history to inform decisions.

2. **Decision Logic**:
   - **First Round**: Defect to maximize initial payoff.
   - **Last Round**: Defect, as there’s no future consequence.
   - **Middle Rounds**: 
     a. Estimate others' cooperation based on historical data.
     b. Compute expected stock levels after cooperating or defecting.
     c. Choose the action that maximizes immediate payoff without causing unsustainable stock depletion.

3. **Sustainability Check**: Ensure post-growth stock remains above 30% of capacity to maintain resource health.

### Detailed Approach:
- **Early Exploitation**: Start by defecting to leverage others' potential cooperation.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Adjust actions based on others' strategies, exploiting when safe and cooperating if necessary to prevent crashes.
- **Risk Management**: Use a threshold (e.g., 30% capacity) to decide when defecting is sustainable.

### Solution Code:
```python
def determine_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock_level, player histories):
    n = number_of_players()
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'Defect'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'Defect'
    else:
        # Estimate cooperation rate of others based on past actions
        cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(player_histories)
        
        # Calculate expected consumption if I Cooperate or Defect
        C_others, D_others = estimate_other_players(cooperation_rate, n-1)
        
        total_consumption_C = (C_others * (stock_level / (2*n))) + (D_others * (stock_level / n)) + (stock_level / (2*n))
        S_remain_C = stock_level - total_consumption_C
        
        growth_C = 2 * S_remain_C * (1 - S_remain_C / capacity)
        S_new_C = min(S_remain_C + growth_C, capacity)
        
        # If I defect
        total_consumption_D = (C_others * (stock_level / (2*n))) + (D_others * (stock_level / n)) + (stock_level / n)
        S_remain_D = stock_level - total_consumption_D
        
        growth_D = 2 * S_remain_D * (1 - S_remain_D / capacity)
        S_new_D = min(S_remain_D + growth_D, capacity)
        
        # Determine if defecting is sustainable
        if (S_new_D >= 0.3 * capacity) and (stock_level / n > stock_level / (2*n)):
            return 'Defect'
        else:
            return 'Cooperate'
```

### Explanation:
- **First Round**: Immediate defect to gain higher payoff.
- **Last Round**: Defect without concern for future rounds.
- **Middle Rounds**: Use cooperation rate estimates to predict consumption, then choose the action that maximizes personal gain while maintaining stock sustainability. If defecting keeps stock above 30% of capacity post-growth, it's chosen; otherwise, cooperate.

This strategy allows exploitation of others' cooperative tendencies while managing risks of resource depletion, ensuring a balance between short-term gains and long-term viability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_188 = '''
The AI's strategy involves initially cooperating to observe opponents' behavior. It then calculates the Opponent Exploitation Rate (OER) and monitors the stock level. If the stock is high (>80%) and OER is low (<30%), it defects to exploit cooperation. When the stock is low (<70%), it cooperates to preserve resources. In late rounds, it prioritizes defecting for maximum payoff. The strategy dynamically adjusts based on OER and stock trends.

### Final Answer:
\boxed{D}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_189 = '''
To maximize your individual gain while balancing the sustainability of the shared resource, you can employ an adaptive strategy based on the current stock level and its trend over recent rounds. Here's how it works:

1. **Threshold (T):** Set T as a fraction of the total capacity, such as 75% of capacity.
2. **Action Selection:**
   - If the current stock S is greater than or equal to T:
     - Choose to defect (maximize your gain in this round).
   - Else:
     - Choose to cooperate (help preserve the resource for future rounds).
3. **Trend Monitoring:** Track whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable over recent rounds.
   - If the stock consistently decreases despite defecting within T, consider lowering your threshold or cooperating more frequently to allow regrowth.

**Answer:**

To maximize individual gain while balancing sustainability, you should defect when the current stock \( S \) is above 75% of capacity and cooperate otherwise. Additionally, monitor the trend of the stock over time to adjust your strategy dynamically. This approach allows you to exploit the resource when it's abundant while preserving it for future rounds.

**Final Answer:**

You should defect when the current stock level \( S \) is at least 75% of capacity and cooperate otherwise. Monitor the stock trend; if it consistently decreases despite defecting, adjust by lowering your threshold or cooperating more often to sustain the resource. The final strategy is:

\boxed{\text{Defect if } S \geq 0.75 \times \text{capacity; else, cooperate}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_190 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing payoffs by exploiting opponents' cooperation while managing resource depletion, I propose a strategic approach that balances exploitation with conservation. The strategy is designed to adapt dynamically based on current conditions and remaining rounds.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Exploration:**
   - For the first 20% of rounds, Cooperate to gather data on opponents' behavior. This phase helps understand their strategies without risking early overexploitation.

2. **Adaptive Exploitation:**
   - After initial exploration:
     a. Calculate the opponents' average cooperation rate over recent rounds (e.g., last N=5 rounds).
     b. If current stock is above 70% of capacity and opponents have been Cooperating more than Defecting, then Defect to exploit their cooperation.
     c. Else, Cooperate to avoid rapid resource depletion.

3. **Late Game Adjustment:**
   - In the last 20% of rounds, prioritize maximizing immediate gains by defecting as much as possible, regardless of stock level, since future impacts are minimal.

4. **Stock Conservation:**
   - If current stock is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate to allow some recovery.
   - If current stock is extremely low (below 30% of capacity), always Cooperate to prevent total depletion.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Exploration:** Ensures a foundation of data on opponents' strategies without early overexploitation.
- **Adaptive Exploitation:** Leverages opponents' cooperation when safe, balancing immediate gains with sustainable resource levels.
- **Late Game Adjustment:** Maximizes payoffs in the final rounds, knowing that future impacts are limited.
- **Stock Conservation:** Prevents rapid depletion, ensuring some recovery potential and sustaining higher cumulative payoffs.

This approach dynamically adjusts based on current conditions, allowing for both exploitation of opponents' cooperation and conservation of resources when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_191 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a strategic approach for an AI to maximize its immediate gains while considering the impact on future rounds. The strategy balances exploitation of cooperative players with sustainability when necessary.

### Approach
1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to establish a baseline and assess others' behaviors.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If more than half of the players Defected in the previous round, Defect this round as well.
   - If the current stock is above 70% of its capacity, Defect to exploit the abundance.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate to maintain resource levels and encourage future sustainability.
3. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last third of the rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate gains without concern for future rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, previous_defectors):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Thresholds
    defection_threshold = 0.5
    stock_high_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    endgame_threshold = (2 * total_rounds) // 3
    
    # Check if in the last third of rounds
    if round_number > endgame_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    prev_d = previous_defectors / (round_number - 1)
    
    if prev_d > defection_threshold or current_stock > stock_high_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# Example usage within a loop over rounds
# Initialize variables outside the loop
current_stock = capacity  # Starting stock is at capacity
n = 10  # Number of players, adjust as needed

for t in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    # previous_defectors would be known from the previous round's action counts
    if t == 1:
        action = 'C'
        # Record action for next rounds
    else:
        action = decide_action(t, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, previous_defectors)
    
    # After determining action, update state variables for next iteration
    # This part would require knowing the actions of all players to compute new_stock
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round**: The AI starts by Cooperating to gather information about other players' behaviors.
- **Subsequent Rounds**: Based on the proportion of players who Defected in the previous round and the current stock level, the AI decides whether to Cooperate or Defect. This ensures that the AI exploits when others are exploitative and when resources are abundant.
- **Endgame Strategy**: In the last third of the rounds, the AI always Defects to maximize immediate gains without worrying about future consequences.

This approach allows the AI to balance between exploiting cooperative players and maintaining sustainable resource levels for future rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_192 = '''
To maximize your payoff while considering both immediate gains and long-term sustainability, adopt a threshold-based strategy that adapts to the current state of the resource and others' behavior:

1. **Threshold Determination**: Set an initial threshold T at 0.75 times the maximum capacity. This represents a sustainable level where cooperation is beneficial.

2. **Cooperation Phase**:
   - If the current stock S is above T and in recent rounds, most players have been cooperating (fewer than m defects), continue to cooperate. This helps maintain or increase the resource level, ensuring higher payoffs over time.

3. **Defection Phase**:
   - If S drops below T or you observe a significant number of defects in previous rounds, switch to defecting. This allows you to exploit the resource before it is depleted by others' actions.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Monitor the stock levels and others' behavior. Adjust T downward if defects increase, making it easier to switch to defecting when necessary to prevent exploitation.

**Conclusion**: Start by cooperating to sustain the resource but be prepared to defect when necessary based on declining stock or increased defection by others. This balanced approach optimizes your payoff while considering both immediate and long-term outcomes.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_193 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting opponents while maintaining enough stock for future rounds. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start with Cooperate (C) in the first few rounds to encourage others and maintain a higher stock level.
2. **Assess Opponents' Behavior:** Track the defection rate of other players over recent rounds.
3. **Adaptive Defection/Cooperation:**
   - **High Stock (≥75% capacity):** If most opponents are Cooperating, defect to exploit their cooperation.
   - **Moderate Stock (25-75%):** Cooperate if many oppose; otherwise, defect.
   - **Low Stock (<25%):** Cooperate to preserve stock unless nearing the end.
4. **Endgame Exploitation:** In the last few rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initialization (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Action: Cooperate (C)
   - Purpose: Encourage others to cooperate and maintain a higher stock for growth.

2. **Assess Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Track the percentage of opponents defecting in recent rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds).
   - Use this to adjust strategy dynamically.

3. **Decision Rules Based on Stock Level:**

   - **High Stock (S ≥ 75% capacity):**
     - If opponent defection rate < 30% → Defect (D)
     - Else → Cooperate (C) to help maintain the stock.
   
   - **Moderate Stock (25% < S < 75%):**
     - If opponent defection rate > 50% → Cooperate (C) to preserve
     - Else → Defect (D) if others are mostly Cooperating.
   
   - **Low Stock (S ≤ 25% capacity):**
     - If rounds remaining > 3 → Cooperate (C) to rebuild stock
     - Else → May defect cautiously if opponents' defection rate is high.

4. **Endgame (Last 3 Rounds):**
   - Always Defect (D)
   - Purpose: Maximize immediate payoff with minimal future impact.

### Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Cooperate.
- **High Stock and Low Defection Rate:** Defect to exploit others' cooperation.
- **Low Stock and High Defection Rate:** Cooperate to rebuild stock.
- **Endgame (Last 3 rounds):** Always Defect.

This strategy is adaptive, exploiting when safe and preserving stock when necessary. It's designed to perform well across varying game parameters by dynamically adjusting based on current conditions.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability by adapting to opponents' behavior and resource levels. Here's how it works:

---

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**
- **First Round:** Start by defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff and set a precedent.
- **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r - last_rounds):**
  - Calculate the proportion of defectors (`p_defect_prev`) in the previous round.
  - If `p_defect_prev` exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%), defect again.
  - Otherwise:
    - Check the current stock level relative to capacity.
    - **If stock is low** (<30% of capacity), cooperate (C) to allow regrowth.
    - **If stock is high** (>80% of capacity), continue defecting (D).
    - **Otherwise**, balance between C and D based on opponents' behavior, defecting more if they tend to cooperate.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Always defect (D) to exploit remaining resources without concern for future rounds.

---

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**
- **First Round:** Start with D to test the waters.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to C to prevent resource depletion and sustain future payoffs.
- **High Stock Levels:** Continue defecting as growth can replenish the stock adequately.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Always defect to maximize immediate gains.

### **3. Pseudocode Implementation**

        if p_defect_prev > threshold_defect:
            return 'D'
        else:
            low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
            high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
            if current_stock < low_threshold:
                return 'C'  # Cooperate to allow regrowth
            elif current_stock > high_threshold:
                return 'D'  # Defect as stock can replenish
            else:

    else:
        return 'D'  # Last few rounds: defect to exploit
```

### **4. Strategy Explanation**
- The strategy is exploitative by defecting when others do so, maximizing immediate gains.
- It adapts dynamically based on the stock level and opponents' behavior, preventing excessive resource depletion and ensuring long-term sustainability.

This approach allows for effective exploitation while maintaining balance, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to exploit cooperative players while preserving the resource when it's low, adapting dynamically based on game state and opponent behavior.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Exploration Phase (First 20% of Rounds):**
   - Always Cooperate (C) to assess opponents' strategies and build a baseline cooperation rate.

2. **Main Exploitation Phase:**
   - After the initial phase, each round evaluate:
     - **Opponents' Cooperation Rate:** Track the average cooperation among other players over recent rounds.
     - **Current Stock Level:** Compare against capacity thresholds (70% high threshold, 30% low threshold).

3. **Exploitation Conditions:**
   - If current stock is above 70% of capacity AND opponents are mostly Cooperating (cooperation rate >60%), Defect (D) to exploit their cooperation.
   - If current stock is below 30%, Cooperate (C) to preserve the resource and prevent further depletion.

4. **Late-Round Adjustment:**
   - In the last 20% of rounds, prioritize exploiting when possible by defecting if opponents are Cooperating, even if the stock isn't excessively high due to limited future impact.

### Strategy Summary:

- **Early Rounds:** Cooperate to observe and build cooperation baseline.
- **Middle Rounds:** Exploit when others cooperate and resources are abundant; preserve when resources are low.
- **Late Rounds:** Shift towards exploiting more aggressively as future rounds' impact diminishes.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to game conditions and opponent behavior.

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting opponents' behaviors with preserving the resource for future gains. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Exploration (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Reasoning:** Observe opponents' initial moves to gather information about their strategies.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Behavior Analysis:** Track the proportion of Defectors among opponents using a moving window of recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds).
   - **Stock Thresholds:**
     - **High Stock (>70% capacity):** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.
     - **Medium Stock (30%-70%):** Decide based on opponent behavior:
       - If >50% of opponents Defected recently, Defect.
       - Otherwise, Cooperate.
     - **Low Stock (<30% capacity):** Cooperate (C) to allow stock growth for future rounds.

3. **Last Round:**

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by Cooperating to observe opponents' strategies.
- **Behavior-Based Decision Making:** Adapts based on the proportion of Defectors observed, encouraging exploitation when safe and cooperation when necessary.
- **Stock Management:** Uses thresholds to balance immediate gains against future sustainability.
- **Last Round Exploitation:** Ensures maximum payoff in the final round without concern for future depletion.

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_197 = '''
The strategy to decide whether to cooperate or defect in each round is based on observing other players' behavior, the current stock level, and ensuring sustainability. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate for the first few rounds (e.g., 3) to establish others' behavior patterns.

2. **Current Stock Check**: If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), consider defecting if enough players are cooperating.

3. **Recent Cooperation Average**: Calculate the average cooperation rate over the last few rounds (e.g., 3). If this average exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%), it's safe to defect because others are sustaining the resource.

4. **Defect or Cooperate Decision**:
   - **Defect**: When stock is high and recent cooperation is sufficient.
   - **Cooperate**: Otherwise, especially if stock is low or cooperation is insufficient.

5. **Last Round**: Always defect since there's no future impact to consider.

This approach balances exploiting others when safe with preserving the resource for long-term gains.

**Answer:**

In each round, you should Cooperate unless the current stock is high and most players have been Cooperating in recent rounds. In the final round, always Defect. The strategy is:

- **Cooperate** if the stock is low or not enough others are Cooperating.
- **Defect** when the stock is high and a majority of players have been Cooperating in recent rounds.
- Always **Defect** in the last round.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate unless the current stock is high and most players have been Cooperating recently, then Defect. In the final round, always Defect.}}$

description_EXPLOITATIVE_198 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting others while maintaining sustainable resource levels. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Rounds (Cooperation Phase):** Start by Cooperating to observe others' behavior and build a baseline of resource sustainability.
2. **Mid Game Adaptation:** Monitor the number of Cooperators and Defectors. If many players are Cooperating, exploit by defecting. If most are defecting, adjust strategy based on stock levels.
3. **Late Rounds (Exploitation Phase):** Increase defection frequency as rounds near completion to maximize immediate payoffs.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Early Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Reason:** Build trust and observe others' strategies without depleting resources rapidly.

2. **Mid Game:**
   - **Action:** If the number of Cooperators in previous rounds exceeds a threshold (e.g., 50%), Defect to exploit their cooperation.
   - **Adjustment:** Monitor stock levels; if high, continue defecting. If low, consider reducing defection to preserve resources.

3. **Late Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Increase defection frequency as the game nears completion (e.g., last 5% of rounds).
   - **Reason:** Maximize immediate gains with fewer future considerations.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a sustainable baseline.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Defect more to exploit others without concern for long-term resource effects.
- **Stock Levels:**
  - **High Stock:** Favor defection to maximize payoff.
  - **Low Stock:** Consider cooperation or reduced defection to prevent rapid depletion.

### Exploitative Mindset:
The strategy exploits others by defecting when they cooperate, maximizing individual payoffs. It adapts dynamically based on observed behavior and stock levels, ensuring sustainable exploitation without causing premature resource collapse.

### Pseudocode Outline:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock_level, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate from previous rounds

### Conclusion:
This strategy adaptively balances exploitation and sustainability, dynamically adjusting actions based on others' behavior, stock levels, and game progression. It aims to maximize individual payoffs while mitigating the risk of rapid resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_199 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances defecting for personal gain with cooperating to maintain the common resource. The strategy is designed to ensure sustainability while maximizing individual benefits.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by always Cooperating in early rounds. This helps build up the stock, ensuring there's enough resource to sustain future harvests.

2. **Defect at High Levels:** Once the stock reaches a certain threshold (e.g., above 80% of capacity), switch to Defecting. At high levels, defecting doesn't significantly deplete the stock, allowing for continued regrowth and maximizing your share without causing long-term damage.

3. **Monitor Stock Changes:** Track how your actions affect the stock. If defecting causes the stock to drop below a critical level (e.g., 60% of capacity), reduce defecting frequency or switch back to Cooperating to allow the stock to recover.

4. **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:** Adjust the threshold dynamically based on observed changes in the stock. If defecting consistently leads to quicker recovery, lower the threshold. Conversely, if it causes significant depletion, raise the threshold and increase cooperation efforts.

5. **Sustainability Check:** Periodically ensure that the overall strategy maintains the stock at healthy levels. This prevents overexploitation and ensures long-term sustainability of the resource.

**Answer:**

To maximize individual gains while maintaining the common resource's sustainability, employ an adaptive strategy where you Cooperate when the stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity) to ensure regrowth and Defect when it exceeds this threshold. Adjust the threshold dynamically based on observed stock changes to optimize between personal gain and collective resource management.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when stock < 60% of capacity; Defect otherwise, adjusting dynamically}}$

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to exploit opponents by defecting when beneficial while maintaining sustainable resource levels. Here's the structured approach:

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - **Action:** Start with Defect in the first round to test others and gain immediate payoff.
   - **Adjustment:** If most players defect, switch to Cooperate to prevent rapid depletion and sustain higher payoffs.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 60%):**
   - **Cooperation Rate Analysis:** Monitor the average cooperation rate from previous rounds.
     - **If > X% Cooperate:** Defect to exploit their kindness.
     - **If < Y% Cooperate:** Switch to Cooperate to avoid stock collapse and ensure future gains.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 20%):**
   - **Action:** Increase defection to maximize immediate payoffs since long-term consequences are minimal.
   - **Adjustment:** Monitor stock levels to prevent collapse, ensuring continued exploitation without causing resource crash.

### Dynamic Adjustments:
- **Stock Monitoring:** Track changes after each round.
  - **High Growth Potential (Near Capacity):** Continue defecting as growth sustains the resource.
  - **Low Growth or Recovery Issues:** Switch to Cooperate to allow stock recovery.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Default to Defect to test and gain immediate payoff.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Prioritize Defect but switch to Cooperate if stock is critically low to prevent crash.
- **Stock Levels:** Adjust actions based on proximity to capacity or low levels to balance exploitation and sustainability.

### Summary:
This strategy balances exploiting others with maintaining sustainable resource use. By adapting based on opponents' behavior and stock dynamics, it maximizes payoffs while preventing premature resource collapse.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_201 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to maintain a high stock level and encourage others to cooperate.
   - **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1):**
     - If current_stock > 0.75 * capacity, Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
     - Else, Cooperate to aid in the recovery of the resource.
   - **Last Round (r):** Always Defect to exploit the remaining stock without concern for future rounds.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, defaulting to Cooperate helps maintain a higher initial stock, which can be beneficial in subsequent rounds.
   - In the last round, defecting maximizes immediate payoff as there are no future consequences.

3. **Exploitative Mindset:**
   - The strategy balances exploitation and sustainability by defecting when the resource is abundant and cooperating when it's scarce.
   - This approach allows for maximum gain while preventing complete depletion of the resource, ensuring it can recover for potential future exploitation.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, previous_actions, round_number, total_rounds):
    capacity = initial_capacity  # Assuming this is known or can be inferred
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        threshold = 0.75 * capacity
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

# Example usage over rounds:
previous_stock = capacity
previous_actions = []

for round in range(1, r + 1):
    action = decide_action(previous_stock, previous_actions, round, r)
    # Simulate the game logic to get new_stock and update previous_stock
    # Update previous_actions with the chosen action for history tracking
```

This strategy dynamically adapts based on the current stock level, exploiting when possible while maintaining sustainability for future gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_202 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' behaviors while maintaining sustainable stock levels.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (Early Game):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to encourage others to cooperate and maintain a stable stock level.
   - This sets a cooperative baseline, which can be exploited in later rounds if opponents continue cooperating.

2. **Mid Game (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Monitor opponents' past actions and current stock levels.
     - If the majority of opponents are defecting:
       - Cooperate to prevent further stock depletion and encourage recovery.
     - If most opponents are cooperating:
       - Defect to exploit their cooperation, gaining higher immediate payoffs while contributing to stock depletion.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - Gradually increase defection frequency as future rounds become limited.
   - In the final few rounds, defect as much as possible since there are no long-term consequences.

4. **Stock Dynamics:**
   - If the stock is high and stable:
     - Defect more often to exploit cooperation.
   - If the stock is low or decreasing:
     - Cooperate to aid recovery and prevent collapse, ensuring future exploitability.

---

### **Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to build a cooperative foundation and observe opponents' initial moves.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20%):** Switch to defecting as much as possible since there's no need for long-term sustainability.
- **Stock Collapse Risk:** If the stock is critically low, prioritize cooperation to recover it.

---

### **Dynamic Adaptation:**

- Track opponents' past actions and adjust behavior accordingly:
  - Use a threshold (e.g., if more than 50% of opponents defect, switch to cooperation).
  - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on remaining rounds and stock levels.
  - In later rounds, even with high defection rates, consider defecting due to limited future impact.

---

### **Pseudocode Outline:**

```
Initialize:
    Cooperate in the first round
    Set low_stock_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    Set defect_proportion_threshold = 0.5

For each round from 2 to r-1:
    current_round_number = t
    remaining_rounds = r - t
    proportion_defectors = count(defect_actions) / n

    if stock <= low_stock_threshold:
        cooperate
    elif proportion_defectors > defect_proportion_threshold:
        cooperate
    else:
        defect

In last 20% of rounds (t > 0.8 * r):
    defect as much as possible

End game logic:
    In the final round, defect if stock is above a minimal threshold to avoid complete collapse.
```

---

### **Summary:**

- Start cooperative to encourage others and set expectations.
- Adapt based on opponents' behavior and stock levels, exploiting when safe and cooperating to prevent collapse.
- Increase defection in later rounds as future impacts diminish.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, ensuring maximum payoff while adapting to diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_203 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and conservation in a shared resource scenario, we propose a strategy that adapts based on the current stock level. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set an initial threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity).
   - Track past stock levels to compute trends.

2. **Each Round**:
   a. Observe the current stock, S.
   
   b. If it's the first round or early rounds, defect to maximize immediate gain.
   
   c. For middle rounds:
      i. Check if S is above the dynamic threshold.
      
      ii. If yes: defect.
      
      iii. If no: cooperate.
   
   d. For the last few rounds (e.g., last 20% of total rounds), defect to maximize payoff since there's no future gain.

3. **Adjust Threshold Dynamically**:
   a. After each round, compute recent stock trends.
   
   b. If the average stock is decreasing: lower the threshold (switch to C sooner).
   
   c. If the average stock is increasing: raise the threshold (allow more D).

4. **Final Decision**:
   - In the final rounds, prioritize immediate gain by defecting.

**Answer**: The optimal strategy involves initially defecting, then defecting when the stock is above a dynamic threshold and cooperating otherwise, while adjusting based on trends and defecting in final rounds for maximum payoff. This balance ensures sustainable exploitation over multiple rounds.

\boxed{\text{Adaptive Defect-Cooperate Strategy Based on Stock Levels}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_204 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to encourage others to also cooperate, setting a cooperative baseline.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - Calculate the cooperation rate among other players from recent history.
     - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity or the cooperation rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%), defect (D) to exploit others' cooperation.
     - Otherwise, cooperate (C) to allow stock recovery and prevent overdepletion.
   - **Final Round:** Always defect (D) for maximum immediate payoff.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round Default:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Round Exploitation:** Defect regardless of others' actions to maximize personal gain.
   - **High Stock Threshold:** If stock is above 80% of capacity, defect as it's safe and profitable.
   - **Low Stock Adjustment:** If stock drops significantly, cooperate to allow growth for future exploitation.

3. **Exploitation Strategy:**
   - Exploit others' cooperation by defecting when they are likely to continue cooperating.
   - Preserve the resource by cooperating when many defect or stock is low, ensuring sustainable exploitation in subsequent rounds.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    threshold_coop_rate = 0.6  # Adjust based on performance

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate cooperation rate from recent history (e.g., last 2-3 rounds)
        relevant_history = get_recent_actions(history, lookback=3)
        total_actions = len(relevant_history) * n
        cooperate_count = sum(1 for action in relevant_history if action == 'C')
        coop_rate = cooperate_count / total_actions

        # Check if current stock is high enough to safely defect
        if current_stock >= capacity * 0.8:
            return 'D'

            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Cooperation Rate Calculation:** The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the proportion of Cooperate actions observed in recent rounds, excluding self.
- **Stock Threshold Check:** Ensures safe exploitation when resources are plentiful.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** The cooperation threshold can be tweaked to optimize performance against different opponent strategies.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to exploit others while preserving the resource for continued advantage.

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on adapting our actions based on opponents' behaviors and the current state of the common pool. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initialization**: Start with Cooperate in the first round to gather baseline data.
2. **Data Collection**: Track each opponent's past actions and payoffs.
3. **Opponent Classification**:
   - **High Defectors**: Frequent Defectors (Defect ratio > 70%).
   - **Low Defectors**: Infrequent Defectors (Defect ratio < 30%).
   - **Conditionals**: Players who switch strategies based on game dynamics.
4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Adjust the threshold for Cooperate/Defect decisions based on stock level and growth rate.
5. **Adaptive Actions**:
   - Exploit Low Defectors by defecting to gain higher payoffs.
   - Cooperate with High Defectors to prevent rapid resource depletion.
   - Anticipate Conditionals' moves to exploit or mitigate their impact.
6. **Last Round Handling**: Defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff.

### Pseudocode Implementation

    # Decide action for this round
    if round_number == r - 1:  # Last round
        return 'D'

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: Start by Cooperating to encourage others and gather data.
- **Classification**: Opponents are classified into High Defectors, Low Defectors, or Conditionals based on their historical actions.
- **Dynamic Threshold**: Adjust the threshold for when to Cooperate or Defect based on current stock levels to balance exploitation with sustainability.
- **Adaptive Actions**: Exploit Low Defectors by defecting, cooperate with High Defectors to prevent resource collapse, and predict Conditionals' moves to gain an advantage.
- **Last Round Handling**: Switch to Defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors and current game state.

1. **Initialization**: Start by cooperating to encourage a positive environment.
2. **Late Game Adjustment**: In the last 10% of rounds, prioritize defecting to maximize personal gain.
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**:
   - **High Resource Levels**: Cooperate if others are mostly cooperating; otherwise, defect to exploit.
   - **Medium Resource Levels**: Cooperate unless a significant proportion of players are defecting.
   - **Low Resource Levels**: Always defect to maximize immediate gains.

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The first move is always to cooperate to foster a cooperative environment.
- **Late Game Strategy**: In the final 10% of rounds, defecting maximizes immediate gains as future rounds are limited.
- **High Resource Levels**: If resources are abundant, cooperation encourages growth unless many players are defecting.

To address the problem, we developed an exploitative strategy that adapts based on the state of the common resource (stock) and the cooperation rates of other players. The strategy aims to maximize immediate gains while maintaining the resource for future exploitation.

### Approach
The approach involves four key components:
1. **Initial Exploitation**: Start by defecting in early rounds to test opponents' behaviors.
2. **Cooperation Rate Monitoring**: Track each opponent's cooperation rate (CR) based on their past actions.
3. **Stock Level Adaptation**: Adjust actions based on the current stock level and its trend.
4. **Endgame Exploitation**: Defect in the last few rounds to maximize immediate gains.

The strategy uses thresholds for both cooperation rates and stock levels to decide whether to defect or cooperate, ensuring a balance between exploitation and resource sustainability.

### Explanation
The strategy begins by defecting in early rounds to gauge opponents' behaviors. It calculates each opponent's cooperation rate and uses it alongside the current stock level to decide actions:

1. **High Stock Levels**: If the resource is abundant, exploit cooperative players by defecting.
2. **Low Stock Levels**: Cooperate to allow recovery of the resource.
3. **Moderate Stock Levels**: Defect if most opponents are cooperative; otherwise, cooperate.

In the final few rounds, the strategy defects to maximize immediate gains, ensuring no future impact from current actions. This approach balances short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed behaviors and resource state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_208 = '''
To address the problem effectively, I'll outline a strategic approach based on balancing exploitation with preservation. This strategy aims to maximize short-term gains while ensuring the sustainability of resources for future exploitation.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Assess Current Resource Level:** Begin by evaluating the current stock level relative to its maximum capacity (e.g., 70% threshold).

2. **Decision to Defect or Cooperate:**
   - If the current stock is above 70% of capacity, choose to defect (D). This allows exploiting the abundant resources for higher immediate payoffs.
   - If the stock is below or equal to 70%, switch to cooperation (C). This helps preserve and gradually rebuild the resource, ensuring its sustainability.

3. **Monitor Stock Trends:** Continuously track changes in the stock level over multiple rounds. If the stock shows a consistent decrease despite cooperation, it may indicate that too many players are defecting. In such cases, consider adjusting the threshold or enhancing preservation efforts.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment (Optional):** For more sophisticated strategies, adjust the threshold dynamically based on observed trends and others' behaviors. This could involve lowering the threshold if the stock is consistently depleting or raising it if resources recover sufficiently.

**Final Strategy:**

- **Defect (D)** when the current stock exceeds 70% of capacity.
- **Cooperate (C)** otherwise, to help preserve and sustain the resource for future exploitation.

This approach ensures a balance between maximizing immediate payoffs and maintaining resource levels for long-term gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_209 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a strategic approach that balances exploitation of cooperative players with preservation of resources to ensure long-term gains. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

### Approach
The strategy is divided into three phases based on the round number and adapts dynamically to opponents' actions while considering the current state of the resource (stock).

1. **Early Rounds (First 30%):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start by Cooperating to assess opponents' behavior without risking immediate depletion.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Dynamically decide based on opponents' previous actions and current stock level.
     - Calculate the percentage of opponents who Defected in the last round (`opponents_defect_ratio`).
     - If `opponents_defect_ratio` is below a threshold (e.g., 50%) and the stock is above a certain level (60% of capacity), **Defect** to exploit their cooperation.
     - Otherwise, **Cooperate** to avoid over-depletion.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20%):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff with no concern for future rounds as they are nearing completion.

### Solution Code
```python

### Explanation
- **Early Rounds:** The strategy starts with Cooperation to observe opponents without immediate risk, fostering potential cooperation.
- **Middle Rounds:** It dynamically adapts. If most opponents Cooperate (low defect ratio) and the resource is sufficiently abundant, it exploits by Defecting. Otherwise, it Cooperates to preserve resources.
- **Late Rounds:** As rounds near completion, it focuses on maximizing payoff regardless of future impact.

This approach ensures a balance between immediate gains and sustainable exploitation, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors while managing resource levels effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_210 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing payoff while considering the impact on future rounds, we can outline a strategy that involves exploiting others when they cooperate and switching to cooperation when necessary. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Exploitation**: Start by defecting (choosing D) in the first few rounds if possible, especially when others are likely to cooperate. This allows you to gain higher immediate payoffs.

2. **Track Others' Behavior**: Observe the defection rate of other players over recent rounds. If most players are cooperating (low defection rate), continue defecting to exploit their cooperation.

3. **Threshold-Based Switching**:
   - **High Stock Threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity)**: When the current stock is above this threshold and others have a low defection rate, defect to maximize payoff.
   - **Low Stock Threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity)**: If the stock drops below this level, switch to cooperating (choosing C) to allow regrowth for future gains.

4. **Adjustment Based on Remaining Rounds**: As the game progresses towards its end, lower the threshold for defecting since there are fewer future rounds to benefit from a recovered stock.

5. **Late-Round Defection**: In the final few rounds, prioritize defecting regardless of others' actions to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future impacts.

By following these steps, you can effectively balance exploiting others with maintaining enough stock for sustainable gains in later rounds.

### Final Answer

The optimal strategy involves exploiting others when they cooperate and switching to cooperation when necessary. Here's the concise answer:

- **Defect** when others are likely to cooperate (low defection rate) and the current stock is high.
- **Cooperate** when the stock is low or when others start defecting heavily.
- **Prioritize Defection** in early rounds for higher immediate payoffs and continue defecting in later rounds regardless of others' actions.

The final answer is encapsulated as:

\boxed{\text{Choose D if others cooperate and stock is high; switch to C if stock is low or when others defect.}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_211 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we will outline a strategic approach designed to maximize personal gain while considering the impact on the shared resource. This strategy involves exploiting others' cooperation when beneficial and transitioning to cooperation when necessary to prevent resource collapse.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to observe others' behaviors.
2. **Dynamic Decision-Making**: For each subsequent round, evaluate recent cooperation rates among other players:
   - If more than 60% of players have cooperated recently and the stock is above a moderate threshold (e.g., 70% capacity), defect to exploit their cooperation.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to help maintain resource levels.
3. **Endgame Exploitation**: In the final few rounds (last 10%), always defect to maximize immediate gains since future impacts are negligible.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock_level, other_players_actions):
    # Initial condition: Cooperate in the first round
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among others (e.g., last 5 rounds)
    recent_coop_rate = sum(1 for action in other_players_actions[-5:] if action == 'C') / len(other_players_actions[-5:]) if len(other_players_actions) >=5 else 0
    
    # If near the end, defect
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        return 'D'
    
    # Cooperate threshold: if stock is above a certain level and cooperation rate is high enough
    if recent_coop_rate > 0.6 and stock_level > 0.7:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to gather information about other players' behaviors.
- **Recent Cooperation Rate Check**: By examining the recent actions of others, the algorithm determines if exploiting their cooperation is advantageous. If a high percentage of players have been cooperating, defecting provides higher immediate gains.
- **Stock Level Threshold**: Ensuring the stock remains above a certain level prevents rapid depletion, allowing for sustainable exploitation in subsequent rounds.
- **Endgame Exploitation**: In the final stages, defecting maximizes personal gain regardless of future impacts since no rounds remain beyond the current point.

This approach balances exploiting others' cooperation with maintaining resource levels to ensure continued gains over multiple rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_212 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Purpose: Encourage others to maintain a healthy stock level, allowing more opportunities for exploitation in later rounds.

2. **Monitoring Others' Behavior:**
   - Track the cooperation rate of other players each round by observing their actions and calculating the average consumption.
   - Identify trends: If most players Cooperate, exploit by defecting. If many Defect, consider Cooperating to preserve resources.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Decision Rule:**
   - Each round, calculate a threshold based on:
     - Current stock level (S)
     - Average cooperation rate of others
     - Number of rounds remaining
   - Formula for Threshold (T):
     T = S / (2n) * (1 + (r_remaining - 1)/r_total)
   - If the expected payoff from Cooperating is less than the threshold, Defect; otherwise, Cooperate.

4. **Adjusting Over Time:**
   - If others Cooperate more, take advantage by defecting to gain higher immediate payoffs.
   - If others Defect significantly, switch to Cooperating to preserve the resource for future gains.

5. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect (D)
     - Reason: No future payoff to consider; maximize immediate gain without worrying about resource preservation.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```
for each round t in r:
    if t is within first 2-3 rounds:
        play C
    else:
        calculate cooperation rate of others
        calculate threshold T based on current stock, cooperation rate, and rounds remaining
        if expected payoff from D > T:
            play D
        else:
            play C
    if t is within last 2-3 rounds:
        play D
```

This strategy dynamically adapts to other players' behaviors, exploiting opportunities when others Cooperate while preserving resources when necessary. It ensures maximum personal payoff by balancing immediate gains with sustainable resource management.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_213 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance immediate gains with considerations of future rounds, exploiting others' behaviors while adapting to the game's dynamics. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' actions and the resource's state. It begins with cooperation to assess others, then adapts based on their behavior and stock levels.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to observe others' strategies and contribute to higher growth.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Track historical actions of other players (number of cooperators/defectors).
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If most players are cooperating and the stock is above a sustainable threshold, defect to gain more while others sustain the resource.
   - If there's an increasing trend of defection or the stock is low, consider defecting earlier to capture remaining resources before depletion.
3. **Last Round (Round r):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff with no future penalties.

### Threshold and Adaptation:
- Use a dynamic threshold based on historical growth rates and consumption patterns to decide when to switch from cooperate to defect.
- Incorporate probabilistic elements to prevent predictability, making the strategy less exploitable by others.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a baseline for future decisions.
- **Last Round:** Defect without concern for future rounds' impacts.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = game_capacity()

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate historical cooperation rate
    cooperators = sum(1 for action in history.values() if action == 'C')
    coop_rate = cooperators / (n - 1)  # Exclude self

    # Determine stock threshold dynamically
    sustainable_threshold = capacity * 0.6  # Example value, can be adjusted

    if stock_level > sustainable_threshold and coop_rate > 0.7:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

    # For the last round, always defect
    if round_number == r:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by cooperating to observe others' strategies.
- **Dynamic Threshold:** Adjusts based on historical data and stock levels to decide when defecting is advantageous.
- **Probabilistic Elements:** Introduces variability in decisions to prevent predictability, enhancing robustness against exploitation.

This strategy aims to exploit others' behaviors while maintaining adaptability to changing game dynamics, ensuring maximum payoff across multiple rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_214 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Sets a cooperative baseline and allows observation of other players' initial strategies.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitoring and Adaptation:**
     - Track the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - Observe opponents' actions to infer their strategies (cooperative or defective).

   - **Stock-Based Decision Making:**
     - **High Stock (S > 0.75 * capacity):** Defect (D)
       - Rationale: High stock can sustain increased consumption, allowing for higher immediate payoffs.
     - **Low Stock (S < 0.25 * capacity):** Cooperate (C)
       - Rationale: Prevents further depletion and allows potential recovery of the stock.

   - **Mid-Stock Levels (0.25 ≤ S ≤ 0.75):**
     - Balance decisions based on opponents' behavior:
       - If many defect, lean towards D to exploit opportunities.
       - If most cooperate, defect moderately to gain higher payoffs without causing significant harm.

3. **Late Rounds (Last Few Rounds, especially Round r):**
   - **Final Round (Round r):**
     - **Action:** Defect (D)
       - Rationale: Maximizes immediate payoff with no future rounds affected.
     - If stock is very low, consider Cooperate to secure any remaining resources.

4. **General Considerations:**
   - **Trend Analysis:** Monitor the trend of stock levels over time. A decreasing trend may indicate excessive defecting by others, prompting a shift towards more cooperative actions.
   - **Player Count Adjustment:** In larger player sets (higher n), be cautious with defection to avoid rapid stock depletion.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to establish initial conditions.
   - **Last Round:** Defect for maximum payoff unless stock is critically low.
   - **Stock Near Capacity:** Safe to defect, as growth can sustain consumption.
   - **Stock Near Zero:** Cooperate to allow recovery and prevent total depletion.

**Heuristic Summary:**

- Start with cooperation to observe others.
- Exploit when the environment allows (high stock) but conserve when at risk (low stock).
- Adapt based on opponents' actions, defecting more if they do, cooperating otherwise.
- In late rounds, prioritize immediate gains while being mindful of remaining resources.

This strategy balances short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to the game state and opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_215 = '''
To determine whether to cooperate or defect in each round, follow this strategy based on the current stock level relative to a threshold:

1. **Assess the Current Stock (S):** Compare the current stock level to 75% of the maximum capacity.

2. **Decision Criteria:**
   - If S ≥ 75% of capacity:
     - **Defect (D):** Choose to defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - Else (S < 75% of capacity):
     - **Cooperate (C):** Choose to cooperate to help replenish the resource, ensuring future exploitation.

This approach balances exploiting the resource when it's abundant with contributing to its sustainability when necessary.

**Answer:** Cooperate if the current stock is below 75% of maximum capacity; otherwise, defect. \boxed{D}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_216 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed an adaptive strategy that balances exploiting the resource when it's abundant and preserving it when it becomes scarce. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the strategy:

### Step 1: Initial Cooperation
**Action:** Cooperate in the first round.
**Reasoning:** Starting with cooperation helps maintain a stable stock, especially since there is no history of other players' actions to inform decisions.

### Step 2: Exploit When Possible
**Action:** In middle rounds (not the first or last), check two conditions:
1. Is the current stock above 80% of capacity?
2. Did more than half of the players cooperate in the previous round?

If both conditions are met, defect to exploit the resource while it's still abundant and others are cooperating.

**Reasoning:** When the stock is high and others are cooperative, defecting provides a higher immediate payoff without significant long-term harm.

### Step 3: Preserve the Resource
**Action:** If either condition in Step 2 is not met, cooperate.
**Reasoning:** Cooperating helps preserve the resource when it's low or when many players are defecting, preventing further depletion and potential collapse of future payoffs.

### Step 4: Maximize Last Round Payoff
**Action:** Defect in the last round.
**Reasoning:** Since there are no future rounds to consider, defecting maximizes immediate payoff without worrying about depleting the resource for subsequent rounds.

### Summary of the Strategy:
- **First Round:** Cooperate.
- **Last Round:** Defect.
- **Middle Rounds:**
  - If stock > 80% and more than half cooperated last round: Defect.
  - Else: Cooperate.

This strategy effectively balances short-term exploitation with long-term preservation, maximizing cumulative payoff over the given rounds.

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to encourage a stable stock level and observe opponents' behavior.
   
2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-5):**
   - Calculate the current stock level and its trend compared to previous rounds.
   - Determine the cooperation threshold dynamically based on recent stock trends and opponent behavior:
     - If the stock is above a dynamic threshold (initially set at 60% of capacity) and not decreasing rapidly, defect (D) to exploit higher immediate payoff.
     - If the stock is below the threshold or showing signs of rapid depletion, cooperate (C) to aid regeneration.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 20% of total rounds):**
   - Switch to always Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoffs without regard for future sustainability.

### **Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to foster a sustainable stock, allowing observation of opponents' initial moves.
- **Rapid Depletion Scenario:** If the stock drops significantly due to widespread defection, switch to Cooperate (C) in subsequent rounds to prevent further depletion and encourage regeneration.
- **Near Endgame:** Focus on maximizing payoffs regardless of long-term sustainability by defecting.

### **Adaptation Mechanism**

- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
  - Increase the threshold if opponents are cooperating more, allowing more Defecting.
  - Decrease the threshold if opponents frequently defect to prevent over-depletion.
  
- **Stock Trend Analysis:**
  - Monitor stock levels over recent rounds. If the stock is increasing or stable above a certain level, continue defecting cautiously.
  - If the stock is decreasing rapidly, switch to Cooperate to allow regeneration.

### **Conclusion**

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with sustainable resource management by dynamically adjusting behavior based on stock levels and opponent actions. It adapts to different scenarios, ensuring maximum payoff while preventing rapid resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_221 = '''
To address the problem of devising an exploitative strategy for maximizing payoffs while considering the sustainability of a shared resource, we can outline a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Objectives
- **Objective:** Maximize cumulative payoff over multiple rounds by strategically choosing between cooperation (C) and defection (D).
- **Constraints:** The resource's stock level affects future payoffs. Overexploitation can lead to long-term depletion, reducing potential gains.

### Step 2: Analyze the Resource Dynamics
- **Stock Recovery:** After each round, the remaining stock grows based on its current level.
- **Sustainability Threshold:** Calculate the maximum sustainable consumption to prevent resource collapse.

### Step 3: Develop a Decision-Making Framework
1. **Current Stock Level (S):** Higher S allows for more exploitation without immediate risks.
2. **Average Defection Rate (ADR):** Reflects others' tendency to defect, influencing your strategy.
3. **Dynamic Threshold:** Adjust based on S and ADR to decide between C and D.

### Step 4: Formulate the Strategy
1. **Initial Round:** Defect to test others' reactions and maximize immediate payoff.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If S is above a certain threshold (e.g., 75%) and ADR is low, defect.
   - If S is below this threshold or ADR is high, cooperate to preserve the resource.
3. **Last Round:** Always defect since there's no future impact.

### Step 5: Implement Adjustments Based on Observations
- Track each player's past actions to infer their strategies.
- Adjust your cooperation/defection rate dynamically based on observed trends and current stock levels.

### Final Strategy Outline

1. **First Round Action:** Defect to gain higher immediate payoff and observe others' responses.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the current stock level (S) and average defection rate (ADR).
   - Set a base threshold for S (e.g., 75% of capacity).
     - If S > 75% and ADR < 50%, defect to exploit cooperation.
     - If S > 75% but ADR ≥ 50%, consider cooperating to prevent rapid depletion.
     - If S ≤ 75%, increase cooperation tendency, especially if ADR is high.
3. **Last Round Action:** Defect since future rounds are nonexistent.

### Summary

By dynamically adjusting your strategy based on current stock levels and others' behaviors, you can maximize immediate payoffs while mitigating the risk of overexploitation. This balanced approach allows for exploitation when safe and cooperation when necessary, adapting to evolving conditions.

**Answer:**

The optimal exploitative strategy is to defect in the first round to test others' behavior and maximize immediate gains. In subsequent rounds:

- If the stock level is above 75% and fewer than half of players have defected on average, continue defecting.
- If the stock is below 75% or there's significant defection among other players, switch to cooperating to preserve the resource for future rounds.
- Defect in the last round since it doesn't affect future outcomes.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability based on observed behavior and current resource levels. 

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{
\text{Defect in the first and last rounds. Cooperate when stock is low or many others defect; defect otherwise.}
}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_222 = '''
The strategy involves starting by defecting to exploit the initial high stock level. Subsequently, the strategy adapts based on opponents' aggregate behavior and the current stock level. The key points are:

1. **First Round**: Defect to exploit.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the stock is below a preservation threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), Cooperate to preserve the stock.
   - If opponents have mostly Cooperated in recent rounds (e.g., >50%), continue defecting to exploit.
   - If opponents are mostly defecting, switch to Cooperating to prevent further stock collapse.

This strategy balances exploiting when possible and preserving when necessary, adapting based on both current state and past behavior.

   - Track how the stock changes each round to inform future actions. If the stock remains stable or grows, continue exploiting by defecting.

3. **Adaptive Mid-Game Strategy:**
   - Continue Defecting if recent rounds (last 10%) show a high number of Cooperators.
   - Switch to Cooperate if many players have started Defecting, leading to significant stock depletion.

4. **Late Game Exploitation (Last 20% of Rounds):**
   - Focus on maximizing immediate gains by defecting heavily in the final rounds since future payoffs are irrelevant.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Defect to assess others' strategies.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below a threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), start Cooperating to allow regrowth.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Defect to maximize gains, even if it depletes the resource further.

6. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Continuously adapt based on stock levels and others' actions. Balance exploitation with cooperation when necessary to maintain resource health for future rounds.

This strategy effectively balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability by adapting to current game dynamics and opponents' behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (Early Exploration):**
   - Cooperate in the first few rounds to observe opponents' behavior and build an initial history of cooperation.

2. **Adaptive Behavior Based on Opponents:**
   - Track the average cooperation rate from previous rounds.
   - If the majority (e.g., over 70%) cooperate, defect to exploit their kindness and gain higher payoffs.

3. **Preservation When Over-Defection Detected:**
   - If too many players (e.g., over 50%) start defecting, switch back to cooperating to prevent rapid stock depletion and ensure some resource remains for future rounds.

4. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - Monitor the current stock level. If it's above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), defect to maximize immediate gains.
   - If the stock is low (below 30%), prioritize cooperation to allow regrowth and prevent resource collapse.

5. **Endgame Strategy (Last Few Rounds):**
   - In the final 10% of rounds, increase defection frequency to grab maximum payoffs without worrying about future rounds or resource recovery.

6. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Continuously adjust cooperation/defection based on observed opponent behavior and stock trends to maximize personal payoff while exploiting others' strategies.

This strategy balances exploitation with preservation, adapting dynamically to ensure maximum gain while considering the sustainability of the common pool resource.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_225 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts to various opponent behaviors while maximizing payoffs, we can outline the following approach:

### **Exploitative Strategy: "Resource Exploit"**

#### **Objective**
Maximize immediate and long-term payoffs by exploiting cooperative behavior when safe and defecting aggressively when beneficial or necessary.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Reason: Start with cooperation to observe others' behaviors and ensure the resource remains sustainable for future exploitation.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   a. If current stock (S) > 70% of capacity:
      - **Action:** Defect.
        - Reason: Exploit high-resource levels for maximum immediate payoff without risking an abrupt collapse.
   b. Else if 30% < S ≤ 70%:
      - **Action:** Cooperate.
        - Reason: Preserve the resource to sustain future exploitation opportunities, especially if others are cooperating.
   c. Else (S ≤ 30%):
      - **Action:** Defect.
        - Reason: Others may be defecting too; secure your share before it's depleted.

3. **Endgame Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect.
     - Reason: Maximize immediate gains without concern for future rounds.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   a. Track the proportion of defects in previous rounds.
   b. If more than 50% of players defect, adjust to cooperate less and defect more to exploit potential cooperative behavior or prevent further depletion.
   c. Adjust thresholds based on observed stock trends and opponent behaviors.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to start.
- **Last Rounds:** Defect aggressively to capture remaining resources.
- **Low Stock (S ≤ 30%):** Defect to secure what's left before it depletes further.
- **High Stock (S >70%):** Safely defect for higher payoff without immediate crash.

---

### **Exploitative Mindset Alignment**

- Exploit when others are cooperating by defecting, maximizing personal gain.
- In high-resource periods, defect to take advantage of surplus.
- During endgame, defect to capture remaining resource without concern for future rounds.
- Adjust based on others' behavior, exploiting trends in their cooperation or defection.

---

### **Implementation Notes**

- **Thresholds Adjustment:** Fine-tune 70% and 30% thresholds based on specific game parameters (n, capacity) and observed stock dynamics.
- **Proportion Tracking:** Use historical data to adjust strategies dynamically, ensuring alignment with opponent behaviors.
- **Stock Dynamics Understanding:** Leverage growth patterns to optimize exploitation periods.

This strategy balances exploiting high-resource opportunities with preserving the resource when necessary, ensuring robust performance across different scenarios.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to observe opponents' behavior and establish a baseline.

2. **Monitor Opponents:**
   - Track the number of players who Cooperate (Coop) versus Defect (Def) each round.
   - Use this data to predict future actions and adjust strategy accordingly.

3. **Threshold-Based Action:**
   - Calculate thresholds dynamically:
     - High Threshold: 80% of capacity
     - Low Threshold: 60% of capacity
   - Decision Rules:
     - If current stock (S) > High Threshold and more than half of opponents Cooperated in the last round, Defect for higher payoff.
     - If S < Low Threshold, Cooperate to allow resource recovery.
     - Otherwise, if most opponents are defecting, switch back to Cooperate to prevent rapid depletion.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Adjust thresholds based on observed growth rates and opponents' strategies each round.
   - Use a weighted average of recent rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds) for more accurate predictions.

5. **Last Round Handling:**
   - Always Defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If stock is near zero, Cooperate to allow minimal growth and prevent complete depletion.
   - If opponents suddenly change strategies (e.g., shift from Coop to Def), adapt by adjusting thresholds accordingly.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
Initialize:
    threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.6 * capacity
    memory = []  # To store past opponent actions and stock levels

For each round t from 1 to r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    count_coop = number of opponents who Cooperated in previous round
    
    if t == 1:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        if current_stock > threshold_high and count_coop / n > 0.5:
            action = Defect
        elif current_stock < threshold_low:
            action = Cooperate
        else:
            # Estimate opponent behavior based on past actions
            recent_coop = sum(memory[-min(len(memory),3):]) 
            if recent_coop / (n*min(len(memory),3)) > 0.5:
                action = Defect
            else:
                action = Cooperate
    
    # Update thresholds dynamically
    update_thresholds(current_stock, action)
    
    # Store current state for future reference
    memory.append(count_coop)
    
    return action

def update_thresholds(S, action):
    # Adjust thresholds based on how the stock changed and payoff received
    global threshold_high, threshold_low
    if action == Defect:
        growth = calculate_growth(S - (S/n))
    else:
        growth = calculate_growth(S - (S/(2n)))
    
    if growth > 0.9 * capacity:
        threshold_high *= 1.05
        threshold_low *= 1.05
    elif growth < 0.1 * capacity:
        threshold_high *= 0.95
        threshold_low *= 0.95

def calculate_growth(S_remaining):
    return 2 * S_remaining * (1 - S_remaining / capacity)
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy starts by Cooperating to observe opponents.
- It uses dynamic thresholds based on the current stock level and past opponent actions.
- If the stock is high and opponents are Cooperating, it defects for higher payoff; if low, it cooperates to allow recovery.
- Thresholds adjust dynamically each round based on observed growth and payoff outcomes.
- In the final round, it always defects to maximize immediate gains.

This strategy balances exploitation with resource preservation, adapting to opponents' behavior while optimizing payoffs over multiple rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_227 = '''
To develop an effective exploitative strategy, we consider the following decision rules based on the current stock level relative to capacity and whether it's the last round:

1. **Cooperate** if:
   - The current stock is below 75% of capacity, or
   - It's not the last round and the current stock is above 75% but the aggregate behavior of opponents suggests they are defecting excessively.

2. **Defect** if:
   - The current stock is above 75% of capacity (to exploit when resources are abundant), unless opponents' actions indicate potential for rapid resource depletion.
   - It's the last round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff without regard to future rounds.

By balancing exploitation with preservation based on these thresholds and observations, the strategy aims to maximize individual gains while considering the sustainability of resource use. This approach allows adaptation to different scenarios and opponent behaviors observed over time.

**Answer:**

The exploitative AI strategy is as follows:

- Cooperate when the current stock is below 75% of capacity.
- Defect when the current stock is above 75% of capacity, except in the last round where you always defect.

This strategy maximizes gains by exploiting abundant resources while preserving them when scarce. The decision is based on thresholds and observations of aggregate opponent behavior without relying on specific coordination.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock < 75% capacity; Defect otherwise (Defect in last round)}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_228 = '''
The exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize individual payoff while considering both immediate gains and long-term sustainability. Here's a structured breakdown of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage others to follow, setting a cooperative precedent.
2. **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitor opponents' actions over time to identify patterns (e.g., consistent cooperation or defection).
3. **Adaptive Exploitation:**
   - **Cooperate with Cooperators:** Continue cooperating if opponents consistently cooperate to maintain higher payoffs through sustainable stock levels.
   - **Defect against Defectors:** Start defecting when opponents defect to exploit their behavior, maximizing immediate gains without causing sudden stock depletion.
4. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - **High Stock:** Prefer cooperation to allow for growth and sustain future rounds.
   - **Low Stock:** Switch to defection to maximize immediate payoffs before potential stock collapse.
5. **Endgame Adjustment:** In the last few rounds, prioritize defecting to exploit remaining resources without concern for future depletion.

### Decision Rules:
- **Cooperate** if:
  - It's one of the first few rounds (to set a cooperative precedent).
  - Opponents have consistently cooperated in previous rounds.
  - Stock levels are high, allowing for sustainable growth.
  
- **Defect** if:
  - Opponents have defecting patterns, exploiting their behavior.
  - Stock levels are low, prioritizing immediate gains.
  - In the last few rounds, focusing on maximizing payoffs without future concerns.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, opponent_actions_history):
    if round_number <= initial_cooperation_rounds:
        return C
    else:
        # Analyze opponents' past actions
        recent_opponent_defections = count_defections(opponent_actions_history[-n:])
        current_stock_ratio = stock_level / capacity
        
        if (recent_opponent_defections < threshold_defections and 
            current_stock_ratio > high_stock_threshold):
            return C
        else:
            return D
```

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Defect to exploit remaining stock without future concerns.

### Summary:
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on opponents' behavior and current stock levels, ensuring robust performance against various opponent strategies.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_229 = '''
To address the problem of optimizing actions in a repeated game where players can either Cooperate or Defect, affecting the shared resource's stock, we propose the following strategy:

1. **Initial Action**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to observe the baseline behavior of other players.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Stock Levels**: Track the current stock level and compare it with previous rounds.
   - **Stock Trend Analysis**:
     - If the stock is increasing or stable, continue defecting to maximize immediate payoff.
     - If the stock is decreasing significantly (e.g., by a predefined percentage like 10% over multiple rounds), switch to Cooperating to allow resource recovery.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Adjust the strategy based on observed trends in stock levels rather than others' individual actions, as direct observation of others' behaviors can be misleading or complex to interpret.

**Final Answer**:

The optimal strategy is a dynamic approach that adapts to the current state of the shared resource. It starts with Cooperating to establish a baseline and then switches between defecting and Cooperating based on observed trends in the stock level, prioritizing immediate gains when possible while ensuring sustainable use of the resource.

\boxed{\text{Adapt dynamically: Cooperate if stock decreases significantly; otherwise, Defect.}}

在中文环境下，考虑到当前的资源水平和未来可能的行为模式，最优策略是：

- **如果当前资源水平较高**，可以考虑“破坏”（即自己获取更多资源），因为这样做对未来的负面影响较小。
- **如果当前资源水平较低**，则应选择“合作”，以保护资源并促进其恢复。

简而言之，决策应平衡眼前利益与未来可持续性。具体行动取决于当前资源状况及对未来行为的预期：

- 当资源充足时，倾向于破坏以获取更多。
- 当资源有限时，倾向于合作以维护长期利益。

**Exploitative Strategy: Exploit and Adapt**

This strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' actions while adapting to changing conditions in the Common Pool Resource Game.

### **Decision Rules**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Defect (D):** Maximize immediate payoff by defecting, as no prior information exists about opponents' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the previous round's total consumption and stock level.
   - Track a moving average of past rounds to smooth decisions.

3. **Cooperation Thresholds:**
   - If the previous stock was above 75% of capacity:
     - **Defect (D):** Exploit the high stock before others deplete it.
   - If the previous stock was between 25% and 75% of capacity:
     - **Cooperate (C) with probability p = (Stock / Capacity):** Balance between maintaining the resource and exploiting it.
   - If the previous stock was below 25% of capacity:
     - **Defect (D):** The resource is nearing depletion; maximize immediate gains.

4. **Opponent Behavior Tracking:**
   - If opponents frequently defect, continue to defect to exploit their exploitation.
   - Adjust defection rate based on the proportion of defectors observed in past rounds.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last 20% of rounds (last r/5 rounds):
     - **Defect (D):** Maximize immediate payoff without regard for future impacts, as there are no future rounds to benefit from cooperation.

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, stock_history, parameters):
    n = parameters['n']
    r = parameters['r']
    capacity = parameters['capacity']
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'  # First round: defect to test others' behavior
    
    # Calculate previous round's total consumption
    prev_stock = stock_history[-2]
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    total_consumption = prev_stock - current_stock
    
    # Track moving average of cooperation levels and stock changes
    avg_coop = sum(history['actions']) / (round_number - 1)
    
    if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
        return 'D'  # Exploit high stock by defecting
    elif 0.25 * capacity < current_stock <= 0.75 * capacity:
        # Cooperate with probability based on stock level
        p = current_stock / capacity
        if random.random() < p:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

    # Endgame strategy
    if round_number > r - (r // 5):
        return 'D'
```

### **Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round:** Always defect to test opponents' initial moves.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Continue defecting to maximize immediate gains as the resource is nearing depletion.
- **High Stock Levels:** Defect to exploit the abundance before it diminishes.
- **Endgame Rounds:** Switch to defecting in the final 20% of rounds to prioritize immediate payoff.

### **Objective**

This strategy aims to exploit opponents' behaviors by adjusting actions based on observed stock levels and past consumption patterns, ensuring maximum individual payoff while adapting to changing game dynamics.

To maximize your payoff in a repeated game where actions affect future rounds, follow this strategic approach:

1. **Initial Exploitation**: Start by defecting (D) in the first round to take advantage of the highest initial stock level.

2. **Balanced Play**: For subsequent middle rounds:
   - If the current stock is above 70% of capacity and fewer than half of other players defected last round, continue defecting.
   - Otherwise, cooperate (C) to avoid over-depleting the resource and allow it to recover.

3. **Final Exploitation**: In the last few rounds, switch back to defecting to maximize your final payoffs since future sustainability is no longer a concern.

# Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

This strategy is designed to exploit opponents in a common pool resource game by balancing short-term gain with long-term sustainability. It adapts dynamically based on the current state of the stock, historical actions of other players, and the progression of rounds.

---

## **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative tone.
   - Observe opponent behavior:
     - If most opponents cooperate, defect in subsequent rounds to exploit their cooperation.
     - If many opponents defect, switch to a defensive cooperation strategy.

2. **Middle Rounds (80% of Total Rounds):**
   - Defect if:
     - The current stock is above 75% of capacity.
     - Fewer than half of the players cooperated in the previous round.
     - You have cooperated in at least two out of the last three rounds.
   - Cooperate otherwise to allow stock regrowth.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 10-20% of Total Rounds):**
   - Defect unconditionally if:
     - The current stock is above 50% of capacity.
     - There are fewer than 5 rounds remaining.
   - Cooperate only if:
     - The stock is below 30% of capacity.
     - You have defected in all previous rounds.

4. **Stock-Based Adjustments:**
   - If the stock drops below 30% of capacity, cooperate to prevent collapse.
   - If the stock exceeds 90% of capacity, defect to maximize short-term gain.

5. **Opponent Behavior Feedback Loop:**
   - Track cooperation/defection rates of individual opponents:
     - Defect against cooperative players to exploit their behavior.
     - Cooperate with defective players to avoid depleting the resource too quickly.

---

## **Edge Cases**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always cooperate in the first round to encourage other players to cooperate initially.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Defect unconditionally to maximize your final-round payoff.

3. **Stock Collapse (Stock ≤ 0):**
   - Cooperate in subsequent rounds to rebuild the stock and reset the game dynamics.

4. **High Stock Growth (Stock ≥ 90% of capacity):**
   - Exploit the situation by defecting to maximize your share before the stock stabilizes.

---

## **Exploitative Mindset**

1. **Leverage Cooperation:**
   - Encourage opponents to cooperate by initially cooperating yourself.
   - Once cooperation is established, start defecting while others continue to cooperate.

2. **Punish Defectors (Indirectly):**
   - If an opponent defects frequently, switch to cooperation temporarily to prevent the stock from collapsing too quickly, forcing them into a lower payoff state.

3. **Adapt to Opponent Behavior:**
   - If opponents are unpredictable or random, balance your actions between cooperation and defection based on the current stock level.
   - If opponents consistently defect, cooperate moderately to maintain the resource for future exploitation.

4. **Exploit Late-Round Urgency:**
   - In the final rounds, defect more aggressively as players become less concerned about long-term sustainability.

## **Key Strategy Features**

1. **Adaptability:**
   - The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the stock level, opponent behavior, and round progression.

2. **Exploitation of Cooperation:**
   - Encourages opponents to cooperate initially before defecting to exploit their cooperative tendencies.

3. **Risk Management:**
   - Cooperates when necessary to prevent stock collapse or rebuild resources for future exploitation.

4. **Late-Round Exploitation:**
   - Takes advantage of the urgency in final rounds by increasing defection rates to maximize short-term gains.

This strategy is designed to be robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors while maintaining a balance between immediate gain and long-term sustainability.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_234 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and preservation in a resource management game, we've developed a strategic approach that adapts based on observed stock levels and consumption patterns. The strategy starts with exploiting others' potential cooperation but switches to preservation if the resource depletes significantly.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Exploitation Phase:** Begin by defecting in early rounds to maximize immediate payoffs, assuming others may cooperate.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels:** After each round, observe the change in stock levels to assess whether the resource is being depleted too quickly.

3. **Adaptive Threshold Check:** Implement a dynamic threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity). If the current stock drops below this threshold, switch to cooperation to allow regrowth and preserve future payoffs.

4. **Preservation Phase:** Cooperate for a set number of rounds or until the stock recovers sufficiently above the threshold.

5. **Reassessment:** After preservation rounds, reassess the trend. If the stock has stabilized or increased, revert to exploiting; otherwise, continue preserving.

**Final Answer:**

The strategy involves initially defecting to exploit others' cooperation and switching to cooperate when the resource depletes significantly. Here's how it's implemented:

```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_stock = None
        self.threshold = 0.6  # 60% of capacity as default

    def action(self, current_stock, history):
        if self.previous_stock is not None:
            stock_change = current_stock - self.previous_stock
            if current_stock < (history.capacity * self.threshold):
                return 'Cooperate'
        
        # Default to Defect unless preservation is needed
        return 'Defect'

    def update(self, current_stock):
        self.previous_stock = current_stock
```

**Answer Explanation:**

- **Initialization:** The strategy starts with `previous_stock` as `None` and sets a default threshold at 60% of the capacity.

- **Action Decision:**
  - If `previous_stock` is available (not the first round), it calculates the change in stock.
  - If the current stock falls below the threshold, indicating significant depletion, the strategy switches to cooperating to preserve resources.
  - By default, the strategy defects to exploit others' potential cooperation.

- **Update Mechanism:** After each round, `previous_stock` is updated to reflect the current state, allowing continuous monitoring of resource levels.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on observed trends in resource availability.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_235 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a dynamic approach that adapts based on previous rounds' outcomes and opponents' actions. Here's a structured plan:

### Strategy Overview
- **Objective:** Maximize immediate payoffs by exploiting opponents while maintaining sustainability for future rounds.
- **Adaptability:** Adjust decisions based on the majority action in previous rounds to either exploit (defect) or sustain (cooperate).

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Maintain a higher stock level for future rounds, encouraging others to cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (2 ≤ t < r):**
   - **Determine Majority Action from Previous Round:**
     - If more than 50% of players cooperated:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
       - **Rationale:** Exploit the cooperative majority for higher immediate payoff.
     - If fewer than 50% of players cooperated:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
       - **Rationale:** Replenish the stock, tricking potential defectors.

3. **Last Round (t = r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff without worrying about future rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round:** Default to cooperation to maintain a sustainable stock.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate gains, as there's no future impact.

### Exploitative Mindset
- **Exploit Cooperative Players:** When the majority cooperates, defecting yields higher payoffs.
- **Sustain Stock When Opponents Exploit:** Switch to cooperation if many defected previously, encouraging replenishment and potential future exploitation.

### Robustness
- The strategy dynamically adapts, making it hard for opponents to predict or exploit, as decisions are based on the previous round's majority action.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(prev_actions):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    
    if current_round() == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round() == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        last_round_coop_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions[-n:] if action == 'C')
        if last_round_coop_count / n > 0.5:
            return 'D'  # Exploit cooperative majority
        else:
            return 'C'  # Sustain and trick potential defectors

# Example usage over rounds:
for t in range(1, r+1):
    action = decide_action(game_history)
    record_action(action)
```

### Summary
This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability by observing opponents' actions. It adapts dynamically to maximize payoffs while preventing excessive stock depletion, ensuring competitiveness across various opponent behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Maintain high stock levels to encourage others to cooperate, ensuring a sustainable resource base.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor and Adapt:**
     - Track the cooperation rate of other players and the current stock level.
     - If most players are cooperating:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
       - **Rationale:** Exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate payoff while ensuring the stock remains above a sustainable threshold to allow growth.
     - If the stock is low or many players are defecting:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
       - **Rationale:** Prevent resource collapse and preserve future payoffs.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff since there's no future round to consider sustainability.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - **Threshold Check:** If the stock falls below a critical threshold or defection rate increases significantly, switch back to cooperate temporarily to prevent collapse.
   - **Sustainability Check:** Ensure that defecting doesn't lead to an irreversible decline in stock; balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def strategy(round_number, history, current_stock):
    if round_number == 1:
        return C
    elif round_number == r:
        return D
    else:
        cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation(history)
        stock_threshold = capacity * 0.5  # Example threshold
        
        if cooperation_rate > 0.7 and current_stock > stock_threshold:
            return D
        else:
            return C
```

**Rationale:**
- The strategy begins cooperatively to maintain high resource levels, encouraging others to do the same.
- It adapts based on observed behavior, exploiting cooperation when beneficial while safeguarding against collapse.
- In the final round, it defects to maximize payoff without concern for future sustainability.

This approach balances immediate gains with cautious exploitation, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_237 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing payoffs while balancing resource exploitation and preservation, a strategic approach is employed. This strategy involves three distinct phases, each tailored to different stages of the game:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Early Rounds (First 30% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Objective:** Maintain a high stock level to encourage others to cooperate, ensuring a sustainable resource base for future exploitation.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 50% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Decision Criterion:**
     - If the current stock is above 60% of capacity, defect.
     - If the stock is below this threshold, cooperate to allow recovery and sustain exploitation in later rounds.
   - **Objective:** Exploit the resource when possible while ensuring some sustainability by cooperating if the stock drops too low.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect.
   - **Objective:** Maximize immediate gains as future payoffs are limited, focusing on extracting maximum value before the game concludes.

### Summary

The strategy balances exploitation with preservation to maximize total payoffs over the game's duration. By cooperating in early rounds, it builds a sustainable resource base. In middle rounds, it defects when the stock is sufficiently high and cooperates if the stock drops, ensuring some recovery. Finally, in late rounds, it switches to always defecting to exploit remaining resources maximally.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy involves three phases:

1. **Cooperate Early:** Preserve the resource by cooperating in the first 30% of rounds.
2. **Exploit Sustainably:** Defect if stock > 60% capacity; else, cooperate in the next 50% of rounds.
3. **Maximize Late Gains:** Always defect in the last 20% of rounds.

Thus, the strategy is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate early, exploit sustainably, and maximize late gains}}

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to exploit opponents while maintaining adaptability to different game states and opponent behaviors. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Early Rounds (First 5):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Encourages others to cooperate, builds a cooperative history, and maintains resource levels for growth.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Calculate the defect rate of opponents in recent rounds (e.g., last 10).
   - If defect rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 40%):
     - **Action:** Cooperate
     - **Rationale:** Prevents resource collapse and allows for growth, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.
   - Else:
     - **Action:** Defect
     - **Rationale:** Exploits others' cooperation for higher immediate payoff.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 5):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Rationale:** Prioritizes immediate gain with limited future rounds, maximizing personal payoff.

### Adjustments Based on Stock Health:

- If the stock is below a certain level (e.g., 30% of capacity):
  - **Action:** Cooperate
  - **Rationale:** Allows resource recovery and prevents collapse, preserving long-term gains.

- Dynamically adjust defect thresholds based on the number of players (n). Higher n may require lower thresholds due to collective impact.

### Edge Cases:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Sets a cooperative tone without prior information.

2. **Last Few Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Rationale:** Maximizes immediate payoff with limited future rounds.

3. **Stock Collapse Imminent:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Allows recovery, preventing total depletion and ensuring some resource for future exploitation.

### Strategy Implementation:

- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust defect thresholds based on game state and opponent behavior.
- **Recent Behavior Focus:** Prioritize recent rounds (e.g., last 10) to adapt to changing strategies.
- **Stock Growth Consideration:** Use the nonlinear growth function to inform decisions, especially when stock is low.

This strategy adapts to various scenarios, ensuring exploitation of opponents while maintaining resource sustainability for long-term gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_239 = '''
To determine whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), consider the following structured approach:

1. **Assess Current Stock Level**:
   - If the current stock is above a high threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), proceed to evaluate opponents' behavior.
   - If below a low threshold (e.g., 30%), prioritize Cooperating to preserve resources.

2. **Evaluate Opponents' Recent Behavior**:
   - Examine the proportion of Defects from opponents over recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - If the defect proportion is below a certain threshold (e.g., 40%), it may be safe to Defect.
   - If above, consider Cooperating to avoid contributing to a potential crash.

3. **Consider Remaining Rounds**:
   - Near the end of the game (e.g., last 10% of rounds), prioritize maximizing immediate gains by defecting if possible.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - **High Stock & Low Opponent Defects**: Defect to exploit others' Cooperation.
   - **Medium Stock**: Cooperate or Defect based on the balance between exploitation and crash risk.
   - **Low Stock**: Cooperate to aid recovery.
   - **Near End of Game**: Defect if possible, focusing on immediate gains.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{D}

(Choose D when conditions favor defecting, such as high stock with low opponent defects or near the game's end.)

description_EXPLOITATIVE_240 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing individual payoff by adapting actions based on others' behavior and the game's state. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
1. **Early Rounds (First 25%):** Cooperate to establish a cooperative image and observe others' strategies.
2. **Middle Rounds:** Adjust actions based on cooperation rates and stock levels:
   - If most players Cooperate and the stock is high, Defect to exploit.
   - If many Defect or stock is low, Cooperate to preserve resources.
3. **Last 25% of Rounds:** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

### Decision Rules
- **Early Game (First 25% rounds):** Play C to build a cooperative history and gather information on others' actions.
- **Middle Game:**
  - Calculate the percentage of Cooperators from previous rounds.
  - If cooperation rate > 60% and stock > 75% capacity, Defect.
  - Otherwise, Cooperate to avoid rapid depletion.
- **Late Game (Last 25% rounds):** Always Defect to maximize payoff.

### Edge Cases Handling
- **First Round:** Play C to establish a cooperative image.
- **Last Round:** Play D to exploit the resource without future concerns.
- **High Stock Levels (>75% capacity):** Exploit by defecting if others Cooperate.
- **Low Stock Levels (<25% capacity):** Switch to Cooperating to allow growth unless in late rounds.

### Pseudocode Outline
```python
def exploitative_strategy(history, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = initial_capacity()
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number > (3/4) * total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        prev_coop_count = count_cooperators(history[-1])
        coop_rate = prev_coop_count / n
        
        if current_stock / capacity > 0.75 and coop_rate >= 0.6:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Conclusion
This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to others' actions while maximizing personal gain. By observing cooperation rates and stock levels, it dynamically adjusts between Cooperating and Defecting to exploit opportunities effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_241 = '''
To maximize your payoff while considering the impact of your actions on future rounds, follow this strategy:

1. **Initial Round**: Start by defecting (D) to test others' reactions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the proportion of opponents who cooperated in the last round (`cooperate_prop`).
   - Check if `cooperate_prop` is above a threshold (e.g., 0.6 for n=4) and if the current stock level is above a safe threshold (e.g., capacity/2).

3. **Decision**:
   - If conditions are met, defect (D) to gain higher payoffs.
   - Otherwise, cooperate (C) to help maintain or rebuild the stock.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - In the last round, defect unconditionally for maximum payoff unless the stock is depleted.

By following this strategy, you exploit others' cooperation when safe and adjust your actions based on the current state of the game, balancing immediate gain with long-term sustainability.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Defect if opponents cooperate sufficiently; otherwise cooperate.}}

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The proposed strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff while maintaining the sustainability of the common pool resource. It adaptively adjusts based on opponents' historical behavior and current stock levels, balancing exploitation with caution.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate as a default to encourage a healthy initial stock.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the opponent cooperation rate (number of Cooperate actions divided by total observed actions).
   - If the opponent cooperation rate is above 60%, defect to exploit others' contributions.
   - If the current stock is below 30% of capacity, cooperate to aid recovery.
   - In the last round, always defect for maximum immediate payoff.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(opponent_history, current_stock):
    r = number_of_rounds
    n = number_of_players
    current_round = len(opponent_history[0])  # Assuming each opponent's history is tracked similarly

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # First round default

    # Calculate opponent cooperation rate
    total_actions = sum(len(h) for h in opponent_history)
    coop_count = sum(1 for h in opponent_history for a in h if a == 'C')
    opp_coop_rate = coop_count / total_actions if total_actions != 0 else 0

    # Last round: defect for maximum payoff
    if current_round == r:

    # Check current stock level
    capacity = game_capacity
    low_stock_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    if current_stock < low_stock_threshold:
        return 'C'

    # Decision based on opponent cooperation rate
    defect_threshold = 0.6
    if opp_coop_rate > defect_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Opponent Cooperation Rate**: By tracking how often others Cooperate, the strategy determines when it's safe to Defect without causing a stock crash.
- **Stock Thresholds**: A low stock threshold ensures cooperation during recovery phases, preventing long-term negative impacts from excessive Defection.
- **Adaptability**: The strategy adapts dynamically based on historical data and current state, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.

This approach effectively balances immediate gains with sustainable practices, ensuring competitive success while mitigating risks of resource depletion.

1. **Initial Exploration (First 2 Rounds):**
   - Cooperate to observe opponents' initial moves and gauge their tendencies towards cooperation or defection.

2. **Monitoring Opponents:**
   - Track each player's actions, payoffs, and consumption patterns.
   - Categorize players into "Cooperators" (tend to cooperate) and "Defectors" (tend to defect).

3. **Adaptive Defection Levels:**
   - **If Cooperators are prevalent:** Increase defection rate against them for higher payoffs without over-depleting the stock.
   - **If Defectors dominate:** Balance between defecting to exploit and cooperating occasionally to prevent rapid stock depletion.

4. **Endgame Strategy (Last 20% of Rounds):**
   - Prioritize immediate payoff by increasing defection to maximize extraction from remaining stock, disregarding future rounds.

5. **Risk Management:**
   - When stock is critically low (<30%), occasionally cooperate to prevent crash and ensure some payoff in subsequent rounds.
   - Monitor opponents' greed; if too many defect, adjust cooperation to mitigate rapid depletion.

                return 'D'
    
    # Default behavior when unsure
    return 'D'

This strategy balances exploitation with adaptive adjustments, ensuring maximum payoff while managing risks of stock depletion. It dynamically responds to opponents' behaviors and game conditions, making it robust across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_244 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing payoffs in a dynamic common-resource game where players can either cooperate (C) or defect (D), we propose a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with future sustainability. The strategy adapts based on the current stock level and the behavior of other players, ensuring optimal exploitation without causing irreversible depletion.

### Approach

1. **Initial Exploitation**: Begin by defecting in the first round to gain maximum immediate payoff.
2. **Adaptive Strategy**:
   - **High Stock Levels (Above 80% Capacity)**: Defect if others are also defecting, ensuring collective exploitation without causing rapid depletion. Cooperate if others are cooperating to encourage resource preservation.
   - **Moderate Stock Levels (Between 30% and 80% Capacity)**: Monitor the rate of stock consumption from previous rounds. If the stock is decreasing rapidly due to high defection rates, switch to cooperation to allow regrowth. Otherwise, continue defecting.
   - **Low Stock Levels (Below 30% Capacity)**: Focus on exploiting what remains in the final rounds but consider cooperation earlier if it helps prevent complete depletion.
3. **Late-Game Exploitation**: In the last five rounds, always defect to maximize immediate gains as future rounds no longer impact your payoff.

### Solution Code

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, capacity, total_rounds, current_round):
    # Define thresholds based on capacity
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    medium_threshold = 0.5 * capacity

    # Check if in late game
    if rounds_remaining <= 5:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate number of defectors last round
    if len(history) >= 2:

        if num_defectors > len(last_actions)/2:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Others are cooperating; defect to exploit
            return 'C'

            # Simplified: assume each D contributes equally to consumption
            if total_consumption > 0.3 * capacity:
                # Stock is decreasing rapidly, switch to C
                return 'C'

        # In late game, exploit; otherwise, try to cooperate if possible
        if rounds_remaining > 5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # Default action if none of the above conditions apply
    return 'D'
```

### Explanation

The strategy begins by defecting in the first round to maximize immediate payoff. It then adapts based on current stock levels and other players' actions:

- **High Stock Levels**: The strategy defects if others are also defecting, maintaining collective exploitation. If others cooperate, it switches to cooperation to encourage resource preservation.
- **Moderate Stock Levels**: By monitoring the rate of stock depletion from previous rounds, the strategy decides whether to continue defecting or switch to cooperation to allow regrowth.
- **Low Stock Levels**: In the final rounds, it defects to exploit remaining resources. Earlier, it may cooperate if it helps prevent complete depletion.

This approach balances immediate gains with future sustainability, ensuring optimal exploitation without causing irreversible resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_245 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a dynamic approach that adapts to opponents' actions while maximizing personal payoff. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with cooperation in the first round to maintain a healthy stock level and avoid immediate depletion.

2. **Adaptive Defection**: Monitor others' actions each round. If the number of defectors increases beyond a threshold or the stock drops significantly, increase defection rate to exploit their behavior.

3. **Endgame Exploitation**: In the final rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoff since future gains are irrelevant.

### Detailed Strategy

1. **First Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale**: Preserve the stock for sustainable payoffs in subsequent rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - **Observation**: Track the number of defectors and the current stock level.
   - **Decision Logic**:
     - If the proportion of defectors is below a threshold (e.g., 30% of players), continue Cooperating to sustain stock growth.
     - If defectors exceed the threshold or the stock falls below a safe level, switch to Defecting more frequently to exploit others' behavior.

3. **Final Rounds**:
   - **Action**: Always Defect (D)
   - **Rationale**: Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def exploitative_strategy(round_number, previous_actions, stock_level, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    n = len(previous_actions) + 1  # total players including self
    num_defectors = sum(1 for actions in previous_actions.values() if 'D' in actions)
    proportion_defectors = num_defectors / n
    
    safe_threshold = capacity * 0.3  # example threshold
    
    if round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    
    if stock_level < safe_threshold or proportion_defectors > 0.3:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to maintain the resource, ensuring sustainable growth in early rounds.
- **Adaptive Defection**: Monitors opponents' actions and stock level to decide when to switch from cooperation to defection. This ensures exploitation of others while maintaining some sustainability.
- **Endgame Exploitation**: In the final rounds, defects to maximize personal gain, knowing future rounds are irrelevant.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, exploiting opponents' behaviors effectively in a tournament setting.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_246 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by defecting early when safe, then cooperating to prevent stock depletion.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Early Rounds (First 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Reason: High initial stock allows defecting without immediate risk.
     - Exploit others' potential cooperation for higher payoff.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 50% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Monitor Stock Level (S):**
     - If S > 60% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - High stock allows defecting while growth compensates.
     - Else if 30% < S ≤ 60%:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - Prevent further depletion to allow growth and sustain resource.
     - If S ≤ 30%:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - Critical threshold; cooperation helps recovery.

3. **Last Rounds (Final 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Prevent stock crash in final rounds to maintain payoff.

---

### **Dynamic Adjustments:**

- **Stock Drop Alert:**
  - If stock decreases rapidly, indicating many defectors:
    - Switch to cooperation earlier than planned.
  
- **Threshold Adjustment:**
  - Dynamically lower the threshold if stock depletes faster than expected.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def choose_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    early_rounds = total_rounds // 4
    late_start = total_rounds - (total_rounds // 4)
    
    if current_round <= early_rounds:
        return 'D'  # Defect in early rounds
    
    stock_threshold_high = 0.6 * capacity
    stock_threshold_low = 0.3 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > stock_threshold_high:
        return 'D'  # Continue defecting when stock is high
    elif current_stock <= stock_threshold_low:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent crash
    else:
        if current_round > late_start:
            return 'C'  # Late rounds: cooperate to sustain payoff
        else:
            return 'C'  # Moderate stock: switch to cooperation
```

---

### **Rationale:**

- **Exploitation:** Start by defecting when the stock is high and less likely to crash immediately.
- **Sustainability:** Switch to cooperation as the stock decreases to prevent a crash, ensuring longer-term gains.
- **Adaptability:** Adjust based on observed stock levels and remaining rounds, dynamically responding to others' actions.

This strategy balances immediate gain with long-term sustainability, exploiting others while protecting against resource collapse.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_247 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for maximizing personal payoffs while balancing resource depletion, we propose a structured approach that combines initial cooperation, strategic exploitation, and adaptive adjustments based on observed behavior and resource levels.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first few rounds to observe others' behaviors and establish a cooperative baseline.
2. **Strategic Exploitation**: In subsequent rounds, defect if more than half of the players are cooperating and resources are sufficient (above 70% capacity).
3. **Sustainability Check**: Cooperate when resource levels are low or when the majority is defecting to prevent rapid depletion.
4. **Late-Round Exploitation**: Switch to always defecting in the last few rounds to maximize immediate gains without worrying about future consequences.

### Solution Code
```python

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by cooperating to gather information about other players' behaviors.
- **Strategic Exploitation**: By defecting when the majority cooperates and resources are sufficient, the strategy maximizes immediate gains while allowing resource replenishment.
- **Sustainability Check**: Cooperating when resources are low prevents rapid depletion, ensuring long-term exploitability.
- **Late-Round Exploitation**: Switching to always defecting in the final rounds capitalizes on the lack of future consequences, maximizing end-game payoffs.

This approach balances exploitation with sustainability, allowing for optimal personal gain while managing resource levels effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_248 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing immediate payoffs while considering long-term sustainability. The strategy adapts based on four key factors: stock level, recent defection history, opponent behavior, and round number.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Immediate Payoff Maximization:** Prioritize defecting (D) when it yields higher rewards without severely depleting the resource.
2. **Adaptability:** Adjust actions dynamically based on current game state and opponent behaviors to exploit cooperation and mitigate risks of over-depletion.
3. **Sustainability Consideration:** Balance immediate gains with long-term resource management to ensure continued exploitation opportunities.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Stock Level (S):**
   - If S is above 70% of capacity, defect to maximize payoff.
   - Between 30% and 70%, consider cooperation if stock growth indicates sustainability.
   - Below 30%, prioritize cooperation to allow recovery.

2. **Recent Defection History:**
   - Track the last three rounds' actions. If defects exceed a threshold (e.g., 60%), switch to cooperation in the next round to prevent over-depletion.

3. **Opponent Behavior:**
   - Observe opponents' past moves. If more than 50% are cooperating, defect to exploit their choices.
   - If most are defecting, continue defecting but monitor stock levels closely.

4. **Round Number:**
   - In early rounds (first 30%), defect to maximize immediate gains.
   - In the last 20%, consider cooperation if stock is low to ensure some resource remains for potential future exploitation.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number, capacity):
    # Calculate factors
    stock_factor = calculate_stock_factor(stock, capacity)
    defection_history = count_defections(history[-3:])
    opponent_coop = estimate_opponent_cooperation(history)
    
    # Weights can be adjusted dynamically based on game progress
    weights = [0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2] if round_number < capacity*0.3 else [0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3]
    
    # Compute scores
    score = (stock_factor * weights[0]) + (defection_history * weights[1]) + 
            (opponent_coop * weights[2]) + (round_number_factor(round_number) * weights[3])
    
    if score > threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

def calculate_stock_factor(stock, capacity):
    if stock > 0.7*capacity:
        return 1
    elif 0.3*capacity < stock <= 0.7*capacity:
        return 0.5
    else:
        return -1

def round_number_factor(round_num, total_rounds=capacity):
    # Adjust based on proximity to end
    factor = (total_rounds - round_num)/total_rounds
    return 1 - factor

# Dynamic adjustment of threshold based on game state
threshold = dynamic_threshold(stock, history)
```

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Default to 'D' for maximum immediate payoff.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Switch focus to exploiting any remaining stock through defection if possible.
- **Stock Depletion:** If stock is critically low, switch to cooperation to allow some recovery.

### Exploitative Mindset:

The strategy exploits opponents by defecting when others cooperate and adapts by cooperating when necessary to prevent resource collapse. It dynamically adjusts based on current state and history, ensuring maximum exploitation while maintaining long-term playability.

This approach balances immediate gains with strategic sustainability, allowing effective exploitation across various opponent behaviors and game states.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_249 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
Maximize total payoff over r rounds by exploiting others' strategies while maintaining sustainable resource levels.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Purpose: Set a tone of strength and test opponents' reactions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Stock Level (S):**
     - If S < capacity/2:
       - Cooperate (C) to aid regrowth and prevent resource collapse.
     - Else if C_count > threshold (e.g., n/2):
       - Defect (D) to exploit others' cooperation for higher payoff.
     - Otherwise:
       - Cooperate (C) to encourage continued cooperation from others.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Rounds r-2, r-1, r):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Purpose: Prevent resource depletion as there are no future rounds for recovery.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

1. **Stock at Capacity (S = capacity):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Reason: The pool can sustain defecting without immediate harm.

2. **Low Stock (S approaching 0):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Purpose: Prevent further depletion and encourage others to do the same.

3. **Too Many Defectors Cause Crash:**
   - **Action:** Switch to Defect (D) if cooperation is failing
     - Reason: Last-resort strategy when collapse is inevitable, aiming to maximize personal gain before endgame.

---

### **Pseudocode**

```python
for each round t in 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = D
    else:
        S = current_stock
        C_count = number_of_cooperators_last_round
        
        if S < capacity / 2:
            action = C
        elif C_count > n / 2:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C
    
    # Apply action and update state
    apply_action(action)
```

---

### **Rationale**

- **Initial Defection:** Sets a competitive tone, encouraging others to cooperate more in subsequent rounds.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Adjusts based on current stock levels and opponents' behavior, exploiting cooperation when possible while preventing resource collapse.
- **Sustainability Focus:** Ensures cooperation in the final rounds to maintain resource levels for all players.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to different scenarios without relying on coordination or communication.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_250 = '''
To determine your optimal strategy in this game, follow these steps:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C). This helps establish a positive contribution to the shared resource and sets a cooperative tone for future rounds.

2. **Last Round**: Always Defect (D). Since there are no subsequent rounds, exploiting the resource maximizes your immediate payoff without worrying about long-term consequences.

3. **Intermediate Rounds**:
   - **Resource Check**: If the current resource level is below 50% of its capacity, Cooperate (C). This helps replenish the resource for future rounds.
   - **Exploit When Safe**: If more than half of the other players Cooperated in the previous round, Defect (D). Exploiting the resource when others are contributing to its sustainability allows you to gain more points without immediate harm to the resource.
   - **Default Cooperate**: In all other cases, Cooperate (C) to contribute to the resource's health and ensure sustainable gains for future rounds.

By balancing exploitation with cooperation based on others' behavior and the current state of the resource, this strategy aims to maximize your payoff while maintaining a sustainable resource level.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_251 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Early Rounds (Initial Moves):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff by exploiting the high initial stock level.

2. **Middle Rounds: Adaptive Play**
   - **Dynamic Threshold Check:**
     - Monitor current stock and historical consumption rates.
     - If stock is above a dynamically adjusted threshold, continue defecting to exploit more.
     - If below threshold, switch to cooperation (C) to allow resource regrowth and prevent crashes.

3. **Opponents' Behavior Tracking:**
   - Observe the number of players defecting or cooperating in recent rounds.
   - Higher defection rates signal potential resource crashes; adjust strategy to cooperate sooner.

4. **Late Rounds (Last Half):**
   - **Focus:** Maximize immediate gains by defecting when possible.
   - **Exception:** If stock is critically low, switch to cooperation briefly to enable regrowth for final exploitation rounds.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Stock at Capacity or Near Zero:**
     - At capacity: Defect, expecting others may do the same leading to depletion.
     - Near zero: Cooperate to allow recovery before defecting again.

6. **Round-Specific Adjustments:**
   - As rounds decrease, prioritize immediate gains over preserving resources.
   - Adapt threshold based on rounds remaining and opponents' behavior.

**Summary:**
The strategy balances immediate exploitation with sustainable play by dynamically adjusting between cooperation and defection. It starts aggressive, adapts to opponent actions and resource levels, and shifts focus towards maximizing payoffs in later rounds while managing risk of stock crashes.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_252 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Sets a baseline and observes initial behavior of other players without significantly depleting the stock.

2. **Middle Rounds (From Round 2 to r - last_10%_of_r):**
   - **Observation Period:** Track cooperation rates in the past 5 rounds, with more recent rounds weighted higher.
   - **Stock Level Check:** Assess current stock relative to capacity. If stock exceeds 80% of capacity, favor defecting; otherwise, favor cooperating.
   - **Decision Making:**
     - Calculate a dynamic cooperation threshold based on stock level:
       - If stock_level > 0.8: threshold = 60%
       - Else: threshold = 50%
     - If the average cooperation rate exceeds the threshold and stock is above 80%, defect (D) to exploit others' cooperation.
     - Otherwise, cooperate (C) to preserve the stock or allow growth.

3. **End Game (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximizes immediate payoff since there's no future benefit in preserving the stock.

**Edge Cases:**

- **First Round Adjustment:** Always Cooperate to gather initial data.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to Cooperate to prevent further depletion and encourage growth.
- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust cooperation thresholds dynamically based on current stock levels to adapt to changing game conditions.

This strategy balances exploitation of cooperative opponents with preservation of the resource when necessary, adapting dynamically to maximize individual payoff while considering the game's state.

This strategy is designed to exploit opponents' behaviors while ensuring maximum personal gain. It adapts based on observed actions and adjusts dynamically through different phases of the game.

---

### **1. Initial Rounds (First 3 Rounds): Cooperate**
- **Action:** Cooperate in each of the first three rounds.
- **Rationale:** Encourages sustainability by maintaining the stock at capacity, allowing observation of opponents' behaviors without immediate depletion.

---

### **2. Middle Rounds: Adaptive Defection Based on Opponents' Actions**
- **Monitor Previous Round's Defectors:** After the initial rounds, check how many players Defected in the previous round.
- **Decision Rule:**
  - If more than 50% of players Defected last round, Defect this round.
  - Otherwise, Cooperate to sustain the stock and encourage continued cooperation.
- **Rationale:** Exploits opponents who frequently Defect while maintaining cooperation when it's beneficial.

---

### **3. Endgame Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds): Always Defect**
- **Action:** Defect in all remaining rounds as the game nears completion.
- **Rationale:** Maximizes personal gain by exploiting any remaining cooperation, knowing there's no future punishment for depleting resources.

---

### **Edge Cases and Adjustments:**
- **First Round Edge Case:** Always Cooperate to set a baseline for sustainability and observe opponents' initial moves.
- **Endgame Threshold Adjustment:** If the number of rounds is small (e.g., r ≤ 10), adjust the endgame threshold to start Defecting earlier, such as in the last two or three rounds.

This strategy balances initial cooperation to encourage sustainability, adapts by exploiting opponents who frequently Defect, and switches to always Defecting in the final rounds to maximize personal gain. It dynamically adjusts based on observed behaviors, ensuring robustness against a wide range of opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_254 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing immediate payoffs while ensuring sustainability. The strategy dynamically adjusts between Cooperate (C) and Defect (D) based on current stock levels, historical actions of opponents, and round progression.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Rounds:** Start by Cooperating to maintain a high stock level and observe others' behaviors.
2. **Current Stock Levels:** Use thresholds relative to capacity to decide between C and D.
3. **Historical Actions:** Track the number of Defectors and Cooperators; exploit cooperation when possible.
4. **Round Progression:** In later rounds, prioritize defecting for immediate gains.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Start with Cooperate to maintain a high stock level and observe others' strategies.
   - If many opponents Defect early, consider cautiously defecting in subsequent rounds.

2. **Current Stock Levels:**
   - **High S (S > 75% capacity):** Consider Defecting if opponents are Cooperating; else, Cooperate to maintain the stock.
   - **Moderate S (25% < S ≤ 75%):** Balance actions based on historical cooperation; exploit by defecting if many Cooperate.
   - **Low S (S ≤ 25%):** Cooperate to allow recovery.

3. **Historical Actions:**
   - Track the number of Defectors and Cooperators over time.
   - If opponents Cooperate, defect to gain higher payoffs.
   - If many Defect, switch to Cooperating to prevent stock collapse.

4. **Round Progression:**
   - In the last 2-3 rounds, prioritize Defecting for immediate gains since future rounds have less impact.

### Pseudocode:

```python
if round < initial_rounds:
    action = Cooperate
else:
    if S > high_threshold:
        if num_cooperators > threshold:
            action = Cooperate
        else:
            action = Defect
    elif low_threshold < S <= high_threshold:
        if num_defectors > threshold:
            action = Cooperate
        else:
            action = Defect
    else:
        action = Cooperate

if in_final_rounds:
    action = Defect
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Ensures a sustainable stock level to maximize future payoffs.
- **Threshold-Based Decisions:** Adjust actions based on current stock, exploiting opponents' cooperation when beneficial.
- **Adaptation to Opponents:** Dynamically switch between C and D based on observed behaviors to exploit while avoiding over-depletion.
- **Late Game Focus:** Shifts towards maximizing immediate gains in final rounds.

This strategy balances short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to maintain a competitive edge.

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Maintain a higher stock for better growth and observe opponents' initial strategies.

2. **Middle Rounds (From round 4 to r-3):**
   - **Assess Opponents:**
     - If most players cooperated in previous rounds:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
       - **Rationale:** Exploit their cooperation for higher immediate payoff while preserving some stock.

       - **Action:** Cooperate (C) or alternate between C and D
       - **Rationale:** Preserve the stock to prevent collapse, ensuring future payoffs.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff with no concern for future rounds.

4. **Stock Threshold Adaptation:**

5. **Adaptability:**
   - Adjust strategy dynamically based on observed opponent behaviors and stock levels to avoid predictability.

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate (C) to encourage a stable initial environment and observe others.

- **Last Round:**
  - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

- **Low Stock Scenario:**
  - If stock is critically low, prioritize cooperation to prevent total depletion.

    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()

    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to observe and maintain stock
    if round_number <= 3:

        if recent_coop / len(opponents_actions) > 0.6:
            # Most are cooperating; exploit by defecting
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Many defecting; balance between C and D based on stock
            if stock_level < capacity * 0.3:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return random.choice(['C', 'D'])

    # Final rounds: Maximize immediate payoff
    else:
        return 'D'

# Note: This is a simplified version; actual implementation may require more sophisticated analysis of opponents' strategies.

**Conclusion:** This strategy balances exploitation with adaptability, ensuring maximum payoff while considering the dynamic nature of the game and opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_256 = '''
To address the problem of sustainably exploiting a shared resource through an adaptive strategy, we propose the following structured approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **First Round**: 
   - **Action**: Defect.
     - Rationale: To test others' behavior and gain immediate payoff.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (excluding the last round)**:
   - **Observations**: Current stock level and proportion of defectors in previous rounds.
   - **Decision Logic**:
     1. **High Stock (>75% capacity)**:
        - **Action**: Defect.
          - Rationale: Growth can sustain high consumption, allowing continued exploitation.
     2. **Moderate Stock (50%-75%)**:
        - If proportion of defectors in the last round > 50%:
          - **Action**: Defect.
            - Rationale: Exploit when others are defecting.
        - Else:
          - **Action**: Cooperate.
            - Rationale: Avoid overexploitation and encourage others to cooperate.
     3. **Low Stock (30%-50%)**:
        - **Action**: Cooperate.
          - Rationale: Allow resource recovery for future exploitation opportunities.
     4. **Very Low Stock (<30%)**:
        - **Action**: Cooperate.
          - Rationale: Prevent collapse and enable regrowth.

3. **Last Round**:
   - **Action**: Defect.
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

### Summary of Strategy

- The strategy balances exploitation with sustainability by adapting to the current stock level and others' actions.
- It uses thresholds (75%, 50%, 30% of capacity) to determine when to defect or cooperate, ensuring resource recovery while maximizing gains.
- This approach is robust across different scenarios, leveraging observable state variables for decision-making.

By following this strategy, we aim to maximize individual payoff while preventing resource collapse, thus sustainably exploiting the shared resource.

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize personal payoff by strategically choosing between Cooperate (C) and Defect (D) in each round, exploiting others' actions while balancing short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect**

- **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate. This fosters a cooperative environment, preserving stock for future rounds.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
  - **Cooperate:** If the current stock level is above a threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity). This preserves resources for sustainable gains over multiple rounds.
  - **Defect:** If the stock is below the threshold and a significant proportion (e.g., more than half) of opponents are defecting. Exploit the situation by defecting to maximize immediate payoff before resource collapse.

- **Last Round (Round r):** Defect. Since there's no future benefit, prioritize immediate gain.

---

### **2. Monitoring Opponents and Stock Dynamics**

- Track opponents' actions each round:
  - If many defect, it signals a potential shift towards depletion. Use this to decide when to switch strategies.
  
- Assess stock changes:
  - Rapid depletion indicates high defection rates; respond by defecting more aggressively.

---

### **3. Thresholds and Safeguards**

- **Stock Threshold:** Set at 80% of capacity. Adjust based on opponent behavior trends.
  
- **Opponent Defection Rate:** If more than half defect, trigger a switch to defecting to exploit the situation.

- **Sudden Stock Drops:** If stock unexpectedly plummets (e.g., due to many defections), quickly switch strategies to capitalize on remaining resources and prevent losses.

---

### **4. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round Without History:** Cooperate to initiate a cooperative environment.
  
- **Last Round Exploitation:** Defect to maximize payoff, disregarding future impacts since no rounds remain.

---

### **5. Implementation Strategy**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with cooperation in the first round.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - After each round, assess stock level and opponents' actions.
   - Use predefined thresholds to decide between C and D.

3. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - Automatically defect in the last round.

---

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def strategy(round_number, stock_level, opponent_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Determine if many opponents are defecting
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions if action == 'D')
    defector_ratio = num_defectors / len(opponent_actions)
    
    # Check stock threshold
    if stock_level > capacity * 0.8:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if defector_ratio > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
            
# Handle last round
if current_round == r:
    return 'D'
```

**Conclusion:**

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on stock levels and opponents' behaviors, aiming to exploit others while maintaining sustainability when beneficial. It ensures maximum personal payoff by strategically responding to game dynamics and opponent actions across rounds.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_258 = '''
To address the problem of creating an exploitative strategy in a repeated game with logistic stock growth, we can outline a step-by-step approach that balances immediate gains with sustainable exploitation. The goal is to maximize individual payoffs while considering the impact on future rounds.

### Step-by-Step Explanation and Strategy

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The game involves multiple players (n) over several rounds (r).
   - Players can either Cooperate ('C') or Defect ('D'), affecting the shared stock resource.
   - Stock grows logistically, meaning it recovers moderately if not overly depleted.

2. **Early Rounds Strategy**:
   - **Objective**: Test opponents' behaviors while maintaining a balance to observe reactions.
   - **Action**: Use a mixed strategy with a higher tendency towards Cooperating (e.g., 60% 'C') to keep the stock high and encourage others to reveal their strategies.

3. **Middle Rounds Strategy**:
   - **Objective**: Exploit opponents who are Cooperating while mirroring those who Defect.
   - **Action**:
     - Analyze recent behavior of other players (e.g., last 5 rounds).
     - If the majority Cooperate (above a threshold, say 70%), switch to mostly Defecting to exploit their willingness to share.
     - If others are primarily Defecting, mirror this behavior but with a slight bias towards Defecting more often.

4. **Late Rounds Strategy**:
   - **Objective**: Maximize exploitation as there's minimal concern for future rounds' impacts.
   - **Action**: Increase the probability of Defecting to near certainty (e.g., 90% or higher), exploiting whatever stock remains without concern for depletion affecting future gains.

5. **Dynamic Adjustments Based on Stock Levels**:
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to its capacity.
   - If the stock is high, continue with a higher Defect rate to exploit abundant resources.
   - If low (below a threshold, e.g., 50% of capacity), consider Cooperating more to allow recovery. However, in late rounds, prioritize Defecting despite low levels to maximize immediate payoff.

6. **Implementation Considerations**:
   - Use thresholds and probabilities to adapt the strategy dynamically.
   - Continuously update assessments of opponents' behaviors based on recent actions.
   - Adjust defect rates according to observed trends and current stock conditions.

### Pseudocode Outline

### Conclusion

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with considerations for future rounds. By dynamically adjusting behaviors based on opponents' actions and current stock levels, the player aims to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining a sustainable level of resource exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_259 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' behaviors while maintaining resource sustainability when necessary.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to observe opponents' initial actions and encourage a cooperative environment.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Track the average cooperation rate of opponents in the previous rounds.
     - If most opponents cooperated, defect (D) to gain higher immediate payoff while they sustain the resource.
     - If many defected, cooperate (C) to prevent further depletion and encourage sustainability.

3. **Stock Level Considerations:**
   - If current stock is high (above 75% of capacity), defect (D) for maximum immediate payoff, leveraging the resource's resilience.
   - If stock is low (below 25%), prioritize cooperation (C) to allow growth and prevent collapse.

4. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate gains without concern for future sustainability since there are few remaining rounds.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, opponent_actions_history):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to observe others

    # Calculate opponents' average cooperation rate
    avg_coop_rate = sum(action == 'C' for actions in opponent_actions_history for action in actions) / (n * (round_number - 1))

    if stock_level > capacity * 0.75:
        return 'D'  # Defect when stock is high, exploit resource resilience
    elif stock_level < capacity * 0.25:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent collapse

    # If many opponents cooperated last round, defect to exploit
    if avg_coop_rate > 0.6:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate if others are defecting to encourage sustainability

    # In the final rounds, prioritize immediate gains
    if round_number > r - (r // 10):
        return 'D'

    return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to foster a cooperative environment and gather information on opponents' behaviors.
- **Adaptive Exploitation:** Monitors opponents' actions; defects when they cooperate, encouraging them to sustain the resource while maximizing personal gain.
- **Stock-Based Decisions:** Uses stock levels to decide between defecting or cooperating, ensuring exploitation without risking collapse.
- **Endgame Focus:** Shifts towards defection in later rounds for maximum payoff, as future sustainability is less critical.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource management, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors and current game state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_260 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Conservation**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Cooperate to observe opponents' behavior and establish a baseline of their strategies.

2. **Opponent Behavior Tracking:**
   - Maintain a record of each opponent's actions (C/D) in previous rounds.
   - Calculate the percentage of times each opponent has Cooperated in recent rounds.

3. **Decision Rules Based on Opponent Cooperation Rate:**
   - If an opponent's cooperation rate is above 60% in the last 5 rounds, defect to exploit their tendency to cooperate.
   - If the cooperation rate is below 40%, consider cooperating more to prevent rapid resource depletion.

4. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - Define a critical stock level (e.g., 30% of capacity). If current stock is above this threshold:
     - Prioritize exploitation by defecting if opponents are likely to cooperate.
   - Below the threshold:
     - Cooperate to allow resource recovery and sustain future exploitation.

5. **Adjustment for Stock Growth:**
   - Monitor the stock's growth rate post-consumption.
   - If growth is significant, continue exploiting (defect) as the resource can sustain higher consumption.
   - If growth is minimal or negative, increase cooperation to prevent depletion.

6. **Last Round Handling:**
   - Defect unconditionally in the final round to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
# Initialize variables
opponent_cooperation = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n+1)}
cooperation_threshold_high = 60  # Percentage
cooperation_threshold_low = 40   # Percentage
critical_stock_level = capacity * 0.3

for each round in rounds:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    # Update opponent cooperation rates based on previous actions
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if action_history[i] == 'C':
            opponent_cooperation[i] += 1
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation percentage for each opponent
    recent_rounds = 5
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        total_actions = len(action_history[i][-recent_rounds:])
        if total_actions > 0:
            cooperation_rate = (opponent_cooperation[i] / total_actions) * 100
        else:
            cooperation_rate = 50  # Default if no recent actions
    
    # Decision logic
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if current_round == last_round:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            if current_stock > critical_stock_level:
                if cooperation_rate[i] > cooperation_threshold_high:
                    action = 'D'  # Exploit by defecting
                elif cooperation_rate[i] < cooperation_threshold_low:
                    action = 'C'  # Cooperate to preserve resource
                else:
                    action = 'C' if random.random() < 0.5 else 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'  # Preserve resource when stock is low
    
    execute_actions()
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins by cooperating to gather data on opponents' behaviors, setting a foundation for exploitation.
- **Opponent Tracking:** By monitoring each opponent's past actions, the strategy adapts to exploit those who cooperate frequently while conserving resources when facing defectors.
- **Stock Management:** The critical stock level ensures that exploitation does not lead to resource collapse. When below this threshold, cooperation is prioritized to allow recovery and sustain long-term gains.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** The strategy adjusts its behavior based on opponents' recent actions and current resource levels, balancing immediate gains with future sustainability.

This approach allows for effective exploitation while mitigating the risks of mutual defection, ensuring robust performance across a variety of opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_261 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above a dynamic threshold and the proportion of defecting players is low.
   - Defect if the stock is below the threshold or the proportion of defectors exceeds a certain level.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to observe others' behavior.
   - **Last Round:** Consider defecting to maximize immediate gain, but adjust based on remaining rounds and current stock health.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Increase the threshold when stock growth is positive, encouraging cooperation.
   - Decrease the threshold when stock is low or many players defect, promoting defection.

4. **Exploitation Mechanism:**
   - Track the number of defectors in each round.
   - If the proportion of defectors exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%), switch to defecting more aggressively.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
Initialize:
    cooperation_threshold = capacity / 2
    defect_proportion_threshold = 0.3
    recent_defectors_count = 0

For each round in r rounds:
    Observe current stock S
    If it's the first round:
        action = 'C'
    Else:
        # Calculate expected outcomes
        if S > cooperation_threshold and recent_defectors / n < defect_proportion_threshold:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'
    
    # Update history for next rounds
    record_action(action)
    update_recent_defectors(recent_defectors + count_of_defectors)

    # Adjust threshold based on past performance
    if stock_growth_last_round > 0:
        cooperation_threshold += increment_value
    else:
        cooperation_threshold -= decrement_value

    # Edge case: Last round consideration
    if current_round == r - 1:
        action = 'D'  # or adjust based on remaining gains
```

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to others' behaviors and the evolving state of the common pool resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_262 = '''
To address the problem, we will outline a strategic approach that balances exploiting the current stock while preserving it for future rounds. The strategy considers the current stock level and adjusts actions based on whether the stock is above or below a defined threshold.

### Approach
The strategy involves two main components:
1. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: Determine whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D) based on whether the current stock is above or below a certain threshold.
2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Adjust the threshold dynamically based on the trend of the stock over previous rounds to maintain sustainability.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, n_players, history):
    # Define base threshold as 80% of capacity
    base_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    # Calculate dynamic threshold adjustment based on stock trend
    if len(history) > 1:
        last_stock = history[-2]['stock']
        current_trend = current_stock - last_stock
        # If stock is increasing, allow more exploitation (lower threshold)
        if current_trend > 0:
            adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * 0.9
        else:
            adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * 1.1
    else:
        adjusted_threshold = base_threshold

    # Decision rule: defect if above threshold and stock is not too low, else cooperate
    if current_stock >= adjusted_threshold and current_stock > capacity * 0.5:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# Example usage:
history = [
    {'round': 1, 'stock': 100},
    {'round': 2, 'stock': 60.9375}
]
n_players = 4
capacity = 100

action = decide_action(60.9375, capacity, n_players, history)
print(f"Action for current stock {history[-1]['stock']}: {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: The strategy uses a base threshold set at 80% of the capacity. If the current stock is above this threshold, the player defects to exploit the high stock level; otherwise, they cooperate to allow recovery.
  
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: The threshold adapts based on the stock's trend. If the stock has been increasing, the threshold decreases slightly (allowing more exploitation), while a decreasing stock increases the threshold (promoting cooperation for recovery).

This approach aims to maximize immediate payoffs while ensuring long-term sustainability by dynamically responding to stock trends and adjusting exploit/cooperate decisions accordingly.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_263 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a strategy that balances exploitation with the need to maintain sustainable resource levels. The approach prioritizes maximizing immediate gains through defection but switches to cooperation when necessary to prevent rapid resource depletion.

### Approach
1. **Initial Defection**: Begin by defecting in the first round to maximize initial payoff.
2. **Adaptive Strategy**:
   - Monitor the stock level and consumption from previous rounds.
   - If the stock has dropped significantly (indicative of high defection rates), switch to cooperation to aid recovery.
   - Otherwise, continue defecting to exploit others' potential cooperation.
3. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, always defect as there are no future consequences.

This strategy ensures that we maximize personal gains while preventing complete resource collapse, thus maintaining opportunities for future exploitation.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    """
    Determines whether to Cooperate or Defect in the current round based on the given state.
    
    Args:
        round_number (int): Current round number starting from 1.
        total_rounds (int): Total number of rounds.
        current_stock (float): Current stock level.
        history (list of dicts): History of previous rounds, each containing 'actions' and 'stock_after'.
        
    Returns:
        str: 'C' for Cooperate or 'D' for Defect.
    """
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate last round's consumption
    prev_stock = history[-1]['stock_after']
    last_consumption = prev_stock - current_stock
    
    # Threshold for considering significant drop (example: 20% of capacity)
    # Assuming initial capacity is 100, adjust as needed
    significant_drop_threshold = 20.0
    
    if last_consumption > significant_drop_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Defection**: The strategy starts by defecting in the first round to maximize immediate gains.
- **Monitoring and Adaptation**: By examining the stock level and consumption from previous rounds, the strategy adapts. If a significant drop is detected (indicative of high defection rates), it switches to cooperation to aid recovery.
- **Final Round Defection**: In the final round, defecting is optimal as there are no future consequences.

This approach ensures a balance between maximizing personal gains and maintaining sustainable resource levels for potential future exploitation.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' behaviors while maintaining the common pool's sustainability.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Purpose: Assess others' behavior and encourage cooperation to establish a stable resource base.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Determine Stock Level Thresholds:**
     - High: >80% of capacity
     - Moderate: 40%-80%
     - Low: ≤40%
   - **Recent Cooperation Rate (last k=3 rounds):**  
     Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated.
   - **Decision Based on Stock and Cooperation:**
     - **If stock is High:**
       - If recent cooperation rate >50%, Defect to exploit.
       - Else, Cooperate to maintain resource stability.
     - **If stock is Moderate:**
       - If recent cooperation rate >60%, Defect.
       - Else, Cooperate to prevent further depletion.
     - **If stock is Low:**
       - Always Cooperate to rebuild the resource.

3. **Last Two Rounds (t > r-2):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Exploit for maximum immediate payoff with no future rounds to consider.

    k = 3  # Look back period
    threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
    threshold_mod = 0.4 * capacity

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    recent_actions = history[-k:] if len(history) >= k else history
    recent_coop_count = sum(1 for actions in recent_actions for action in actions if action == 'C')
    recent_coop_rate = recent_coop_count / (n * k)
    
    stock_level = stock_history[-1] if stock_history else capacity

    if current_round > total_rounds - 2:
        return 'D'
    
    if stock_level > threshold_high:
        if recent_coop_rate > 0.5:

        else:
            return 'C'
    elif threshold_mod < stock_level <= threshold_high:
        if recent_coop_rate > 0.6:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    else:  # Low stock
        return 'C'
```

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Start with Cooperate to encourage others and assess their behavior.
- **Last Two Rounds:** Switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs, as there are no future rounds affected.

---

**Explanation:**
The strategy balances exploitation and preservation by adapting to stock levels and recent cooperation rates. It exploits when others cooperate under high resource conditions, preserves the resource when necessary, and maximizes payoffs in final rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_265 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing immediate payoffs while undermining others' potential cooperation. Here's the strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
- **Exploit Immediate Payoffs:** Always defect to gain higher immediate returns compared to cooperating.
- **Adapt to Stock Levels:** Continue defecting regardless of stock levels since it always yields a higher or equal payoff than cooperating.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** Defect in all rounds, including the last round, as there's no future beyond it.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff and encourage others to defect.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** Continue defecting regardless of the stock level or previous actions because defecting always provides a higher or equal payoff compared to cooperating.
3. **Last Round:** Defect to ensure maximum payoff with no regard for future rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Low Stock Levels:** Even if the stock is low, defecting gives a higher immediate payoff than cooperating.
- **Zero Stock:** Defecting yields zero payoff, same as cooperating, so it doesn't matter which action is chosen, but defecting remains consistent with the strategy.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def choose_action(round_number, current_stock, history):
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy ensures that you maximize your immediate payoffs while potentially encouraging others to defect as well, leading to quicker depletion of the resource and higher gains for you in each round.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_266 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Design an adaptive, exploitative strategy that maximizes individual payoff by considering current and future payoffs, opponents' behavior, and stock dynamics.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Test others' behavior to gauge their initial strategies.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:**
     - If current stock > 75% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - Rationale: High stock allows higher immediate payoff without significant depletion.
     - Else if current stock ≤ 75% of capacity:
       - **Cooperation Trigger:**
         - Count recent defectors in the last 3 rounds.
         - If more than 50% of players have recently defected:
           - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
             - Rationale: Encourage resource preservation and prevent future depletion.
           - Else:
             - **Action:** Defect (D)
               - Rationale: Exploit others' cooperation to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: No future rounds; prioritize maximum immediate payoff.

---

### **Adaptation and Monitoring:**

- **Stock Trend Analysis:** Track stock levels over previous rounds to predict trends (increasing, decreasing).
  - If the trend is decreasing, increase cooperation to prevent further depletion.
  - If the trend is increasing, defect to capitalize on higher payoffs.

- **Opponent Behavior Tracking:** Maintain a record of each player's actions in recent rounds.
  - Switch to cooperation if observing a surge in defection (to encourage sustainability).
  - Defect if others are predominantly cooperating (exploit their behavior).

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

1. **First Round Edge Case:**
   - Defect regardless of stock level to test opponents' initial strategies.

2. **Last Round Edge Case:**
   - Always defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

3. **Stock Collapse Scenario:**
   - If the stock drops significantly below capacity in any round:
     - **Immediate Action:** Cooperate (C) in subsequent rounds.
     - Rationale: Prevent further collapse and allow resource recovery.

4. **Sudden Shift in Opponent Behavior:**
   - Monitor sudden changes in others' actions (e.g., a switch from cooperation to defection).
   - Adjust strategy dynamically:
     - If others start defecting more, increase cooperation to encourage mutual preservation.
     - If others continue cooperating, exploit by defecting.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate recent defectors in last 3 rounds (or fewer if early)
        recent_rounds = history[-3:] if len(history) >= 3 else history
        num_defectors = sum(round.count('D') for round in recent_rounds)

        # Determine cooperation based on stock and opponent behavior
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Check proportion of recent defectors
            total_players_per_round = n * len(recent_rounds)
            defector_ratio = num_defectors / total_players_per_round

            if defector_ratio > 0.5:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### **Conclusion:**

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on stock levels and opponents' behavior. It ensures maximum payoff while adapting to different scenarios, making it robust against various opponent strategies in a competitive tournament setting.

       - Adjust strategy dynamically. If opponents are cooperating more, defect to gain higher payoffs. If they're defecting frequently, cooperate to prevent over-depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Rationale: No future rounds left; maximize payoff by defecting without concern for stock preservation.

4. **Adaptive Thresholds and Adjustments:**
   - Use a proportion threshold (e.g., 50%) of opponent defections in recent rounds to decide between defecting or cooperating.
   - Balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, exploiting when possible but preserving the resource when necessary.

This strategy adaptively exploits others' behaviors while considering stock dynamics, ensuring both immediate payoff maximization and strategic preservation for future exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_268 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation with conservation in a repeated game where the stock's sustainability affects future payoffs, we propose a strategic approach. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining sustainable stock levels.

### Approach
The strategy involves three main phases: initial cooperation, middle rounds with conditional defection based on previous cooperation rates and current stock levels, and endgame handling where immediate gains are prioritized.

1. **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate to maintain high stock levels and encourage others to cooperate.
2. **Middle Rounds**: Defect if the previous round's cooperation rate exceeds 60% and the current stock is above 70% of capacity; otherwise, cooperate to maintain or rebuild the stock.
3. **Endgame Handling**: In the last few rounds, defect unless the stock is critically low, prioritizing immediate gains.

### Solution Code
Here is a Python implementation of the proposed strategy:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, num_players, previous_actions, current_stock, capacity):
    cooperation_threshold = 0.6
    stock_high_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    endgame_rounds = 5

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate in the previous round
    c_prev = sum(1 for action in previous_actions[-num_players:] if action == 'C')
    c_rate_prev = c_prev / num_players
    
    total_rounds = len(previous_actions) // num_players + 1  # Total rounds so far including current
    remaining_rounds = total_rounds - round_number + 1

    # Check if we are in the endgame phase
    if remaining_rounds <= endgame_rounds:
        if current_stock < 0.2 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # Middle rounds: decide based on previous cooperation rate and current stock
    if current_stock > stock_high_threshold and c_rate_prev > cooperation_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# Example usage:
capacity = 100  # Example capacity
num_players = 5  # Number of players
previous_actions = ['C'] * num_players  # Initial round

for round_number in range(1, 20):  # Simulate several rounds
    if round_number == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        current_stock = 90  # Example stock level for round 2 onwards
        action = decide_action(round_number, num_players, previous_actions, current_stock, capacity)
    
    print(f"Round {round_number}: Action is {action}")
    previous_actions.extend([action] * num_players)  # Update actions (simplified for example)
```

### Explanation
The strategy begins with cooperation to maintain high stock levels. As the game progresses, it conditionally defects based on the previous round's cooperation rate and current stock level. In the endgame phase, defecting is prioritized unless the stock is critically low. This approach balances exploitation and conservation to maximize individual payoff while ensuring sustainable stock levels for future gains.

By following this strategy, players can effectively exploit others' cooperation when beneficial while conserving resources when necessary, leading to optimal long-term payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_269 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Purpose: Maintain a high initial stock level to encourage others to cooperate and set a positive precedent.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Decision Rules:**
     a. Calculate the current stock level (S).
     b. Determine if S is above 75% of capacity.
     c. Assess the number of Defectors in previous rounds:
        - If the number of Defectors is below n/2 and S > 0.75 * capacity, defect for higher payoff.
        - Otherwise, cooperate to preserve the stock.

3. **Late Rounds (Last Two Rounds, r-1 and r):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate unless the stock is extremely high, in which case defecting might still be beneficial without risking depletion.
     - Purpose: Preserve whatever stock remains for sustainable growth until the end.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Use historical data to adjust thresholds dynamically. If more players defect, lower the threshold for switching back to cooperation to prevent further decline.

This strategy balances exploitation with preservation, ensuring maximum payoffs while maintaining sustainable resource levels against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_270 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize personal payoff by exploiting others while adapting to their behaviors and the game's dynamics.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Rationale: Exploit the maximum possible stock when it is at full capacity, ensuring a higher immediate payoff.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the average action of other players in the previous two rounds.
     - If more than half defected, switch to cooperation.
     - Otherwise, continue defecting.

3. **Stock Threshold Check:**
   - **Check Stock Level:**
     - If current stock is below 50% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
         - Rationale: Prevent stock collapse and allow recovery for future rounds.
     - Else if above 50%:
       - Continue with the action determined in Step 2.

4. **Final Rounds (Last Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoffs as there is no future benefit from maintaining the stock.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    n = number_of_players  # Given parameter
    capacity = game_capacity  # Given parameter

    if round_number == 1:
        return D  # Defect in the first round

    elif 2 <= round_number < r - 1:
        # Calculate average action of other players in previous rounds
        recent_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-2:] if action == D)
        if recent_defectors / (2 * n) > 0.5:
            return C  # Cooperate to help rebuild stock
        else:
            return D  # Defect to exploit others

    elif round_number >= r - 1:
        # Check current stock level
        if stock_level < capacity * 0.5:
            return C  # Cooperate to allow growth
        else:
            return D  # Defect for maximum immediate payoff

    else:
        # Default action (shouldn't be reached)
        return D
```

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:**
  - Always defect to exploit the high initial stock level.

- **Low Stock Levels:**
  - Switch to cooperation to prevent further depletion and allow growth.

- **Final Rounds:**
  - Focus on maximizing immediate payoffs by defecting, as future rounds are limited.

---

### **Rationale**

This strategy balances exploitation with strategic cooperation when necessary. By defecting initially, it maximizes short-term gains. It adapts by cooperating if others exploit too much, preventing stock collapse and ensuring long-term sustainability. In the final rounds, prioritizing immediate payoffs ensures no resources are left unexploited.

---

### **Summary**

- **Exploitation:** Start with defection to gain higher payoffs when the stock is abundant.
- **Adaptation:** Monitor others' actions and switch strategies based on their behaviors and the stock's state.
- **Sustainability Check:** Cooperate when necessary to maintain or rebuild the stock for future rounds, preventing collapse.
- **Endgame Focus:** Defect in the final rounds to maximize immediate payoffs.

This approach is robust against various opponent strategies, dynamically adapting to exploit others while ensuring long-term viability of the common resource when needed.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_271 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and sustainability in a game with perfect information, we'll outline a strategic approach that considers both immediate gains and future implications. This strategy is designed to adapt based on the current state of the game and the observed behavior of other players.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Round (Cooperate):**
   - Start by Cooperating in the first round. This action aims to encourage others to Cooperate, maintaining a high stock level for future exploitation opportunities.

2. **Middle Rounds: Exploit When Safe:**
   - **Condition 1:** Current stock exceeds 80% of capacity.
   - **Condition 2:** More than half of the players Cooperated in the previous round.
   - If both conditions are met, Defect to exploit the high stock and others' willingness to Cooperate.
   - **Else:** Cooperate to help maintain or recover the stock.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 20%): Exploit Aggressively:**
   - In the last 20% of total rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are limited.

4. **Adaptability Check (Optional for Robustness):**
   - After defecting, monitor the stock level in the next round.
   - If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), switch to Cooperating for the subsequent rounds to aid in recovery.

### Explanation:

- **Initial Round:** By Cooperating first, we encourage others to maintain high stock levels, setting the stage for future exploitation.
  
- **Middle Rounds:** The strategy exploits when it's safe (high stock and others' Cooperation) while ensuring sustainability by Cooperating otherwise. This balance helps prevent rapid depletion of resources.

- **Final Rounds:** As the game nears its end, defecting maximizes immediate payoffs without concern for long-term sustainability since no future rounds remain.

This approach effectively navigates between exploitation and sustainability, adapting to others' actions and current conditions to optimize overall payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_272 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance cooperation with exploitation based on the game's state and history. The strategy should adapt dynamically to maximize payoffs while considering the impact of actions on future rounds.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first few rounds to maintain a high stock level and observe other players' behaviors.
2. **Defection Threshold**: Monitor the number of defects by other players. If more than half of the players defect in previous rounds, switch to Defecting.
3. **Stock Level Check**: If the current stock is below 75% of capacity, consider Defecting to maximize immediate payoff before potential depletion.
4. **Final Rounds Exploitation**: In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%), always Defect since there's no future impact.

### Decision Rules

- **First Round Default**: Cooperate initially to observe others' actions without significantly depleting the stock.
- **Cooperate When Safe**: If the current stock is above 75% of capacity and less than half of players have defected in previous rounds, Cooperate.
- **Defect Aggressively**: If more than half of players have defected or if the stock is below a safe threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), switch to Defecting.
- **Exploit Final Rounds**: Always Defect in the last few rounds to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round**: Cooperate to gather information on others' strategies.
- **Low Stock**: If stock is low, defect to exploit remaining resources before they deplete further.
- **Last Round(s)**: Switch to always Defecting to capitalize on the last opportunities without worrying about future impacts.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, player_history):
    n = number_of_players()
    
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to observe behavior
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if it's the last few rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds)
    if round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate average defects in previous rounds
    avg_defect = sum(1 for history in player_history.values() 
                     for action in history[-3:] if action == 'D') / (n * 3)
    
    # Current stock threshold check
    safe_stock = capacity * 0.75
    
    # Decision based on defects and stock level
    if current_stock > safe_stock and avg_defect < 0.5:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins by Cooperating to maintain high stock levels and observe others' actions without immediate depletion.
- **Defection Threshold**: By monitoring the average number of defects, the strategy adapts, switching to Defecting when others are exploiting the resource more frequently.
- **Stock Level Check**: Maintaining a safe stock level ensures sustainability while allowing exploitation when necessary.
- **Final Rounds Exploitation**: The last few rounds are exploited by always defecting to maximize immediate gains without concern for future depletion.

This strategy balances cooperation and defection dynamically, exploiting others' behaviors while maintaining adaptability to different game states.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_273 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Reasoning: Start with a stable state to encourage others to cooperate, which may lead to higher stock levels in future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the proportion of opponents who cooperated in the previous round.
   - Use a dynamic threshold based on this proportion and current stock level:
     - If more than 60% of opponents cooperated, defect to exploit their cooperation.
     - If fewer than 60% cooperated, cooperate to help rebuild the stock.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Reasoning: Maximize immediate payoff as there are no future rounds to consider.

4. **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Adjust the threshold based on observed stock trends. If the stock remains low despite cooperation, lower the threshold to encourage more cooperative behavior from others.

5. **Memory of Past Actions:**
   - Maintain a memory of opponents' actions to dynamically adjust cooperation and defection rates, ensuring flexibility against different strategies.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round < r:
        coop_proportion = count_last_round_coop(history) / n
        if current_stock > capacity * 0.8 and coop_proportion > 0.6:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    else:  # Last round
        return 'D'
```

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, aiming to maximize long-term gains by adapting to opponents' behaviors while managing the common pool resource effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_274 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Observations and Testing:**
   - Begin with a default Defect (D) action in the first round to assess opponents' reactions and establish a baseline of their behavior.

2. **Dynamic Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
   - Calculate a cooperation threshold based on the current stock level, adjusting it dynamically as the game progresses.
   - If the stock is above the threshold, defect; if below, cooperate. This threshold decreases over time to encourage sustainability in later rounds.

3. **Adaptive Behavior Based on Opponents:**
   - Analyze each opponent's past actions to predict their future moves. For instance, players who frequently defect may continue doing so, influencing my strategy.
   - If a significant number of opponents are defecting, consider lowering your cooperation threshold to prevent rapid resource depletion.

4. **Round Positioning and Final Round Strategy:**
   - In the early rounds, prioritize defecting to maximize immediate payoff while observing the stock's resilience.
   - As rounds progress towards the end, especially the last round, lean towards defecting more aggressively since future consequences are negligible.

5. **Feedback and Adjustment Loop:**
   - After each round, assess the new stock level and opponents' actions to adjust your strategy dynamically.
   - This continuous feedback loop allows for exploitation of opponents while maintaining resource sustainability for continued gains.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
Initialize:
    cooperation_threshold = initial_stock_level / 2

For each round in rounds:
    If it's the first round:
        Choose D
    Else:
        Calculate cooperation_threshold as min(current_stock, (initial_stock_level * remaining_rounds) / total_rounds)
        If current_stock > cooperation_threshold:
            Choose D if at least half of opponents have defected previously; else choose C
        Else:
            Choose C
    Adjust cooperation_threshold based on opponents' defect rates and stock growth

Handle final round with a higher tendency to defect.
```

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainable resource management, allowing for maximum payoff while adapting to opponents' behaviors throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_275 = '''
To address the problem as an exploitative AI aiming to maximize immediate payoff while considering future opportunities, here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy Outline:
1. **Initial Round Exploitation:**
   - **Action:** Defect in the first round.
     - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff when the stock is at full capacity.

2. **Adaptive Exploitation in Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Decision Criteria:**
     1. **Stock Threshold Check:** 
        - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, defect to exploit.
        - If below or equal to 50%, cooperate to allow growth for future exploitation.
     2. **Remaining Rounds Adjustment:**
        - As the number of remaining rounds decreases (closer to the end), lower the threshold willingness to cooperate, prioritizing immediate gain.

3. **Final Round Exploitation:**
   - **Action:** Defect in the last round regardless of stock level.
     - **Rationale:** No future rounds left; maximize payoff.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round:**
  - Always defect to take advantage of the full capacity stock for maximum immediate payoff.

- **Middle Rounds (Not First or Last):**
  - If current stock > 50% of capacity:
    - Defect to exploit while maintaining enough resource potential for future rounds.
  - Else:
    - Cooperate temporarily to allow the stock to recover, ensuring continued exploitation opportunities in later rounds.

- **Last Round:**
  - Always defect to maximize payoff since there's no future impact to consider.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Low Stock Levels:** If cooperation is chosen due to low stock, it aims to prevent a crash that would eliminate future payoffs.
- **Near Capacity Stock:** Aggressive exploitation is safe because the resource can still recover adequately for future rounds.

This strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable exploitation by adapting actions based on current conditions and remaining opportunities.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_276 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation with sustainability in a repeated game setting, we can employ a strategy that adapts based on others' actions and the current state of the resource (stock). Here is a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The goal is to maximize individual payoff while considering long-term sustainability. The strategy involves exploiting others when they cooperate but also cooperating to prevent resource depletion.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - *Rationale:* Establishing a cooperative baseline encourages others to follow suit in subsequent rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to N-3):**
   - **Step 1:** Assess the previous round's actions.
     - Count how many players Cooperated (`count_C`).
   - **Step 2:** Determine if exploitation is feasible.
     - If `count_C > n/2` (more than half of the players Cooperated):
       - Check the current stock level relative to a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity).
         - **If Current Stock > Threshold:**
           - **Action:** Defect.
             - *Rationale:* Exploit others' cooperation while ensuring sufficient resource remains for growth.
         - **Else:**
           - **Action:** Cooperate.
             - *Rationale:* Prevent further depletion to maintain sustainable levels.
     - If `count_C ≤ n/2` (half or fewer players Cooperated):
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - *Rationale:* Encourage others to cooperate and help sustain the resource.

3. **Final Three Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Defect if possible.
     - *Rationale:* Maximize immediate payoff with no future rounds left for exploitation or sustainability.

### Pseudocode Representation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, remaining_rounds, current_stock, count_C_last_round, n, capacity):
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity  # Fixed threshold at 70% of capacity
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif remaining_rounds <= 3:
        # Near the end; maximize payoff
        return 'D' if current_stock > 0 else 'C'
    else:
        # Exploit when others cooperate and stock is sufficient
        if count_C_last_round > n / 2:
            if current_stock > threshold:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        else:
            # Others are defecting; try to sustain by cooperating
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation of Each Component:
- **First Round:** By Cooperating initially, we signal a willingness to collaborate, which can encourage others to also Cooperate in future rounds.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds (Middle Game):**
  - **Counting Cooperators:** Tracking the number of Cooperators helps determine whether exploiting their behavior is beneficial or if cooperation is necessary to prevent resource depletion.
  - **Threshold Check:** The threshold ensures that Defecting does not lead to excessive resource depletion. If the stock is above this level, Defecting can be done safely as regrowth is likely.

- **Endgame (Last Three Rounds):** Since there are no future rounds left for potential exploitation or sustainability efforts, defecting maximizes immediate payoff.

### Conclusion:
This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by exploiting others' cooperation when safe and cooperating to maintain resource levels when necessary. It adapts dynamically based on the current state of the game and the actions of other players.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_277 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing immediate payoffs while ensuring sustainable stock levels, we adopt a strategy that balances defecting when the stock is high and cooperating as it depletes. The decision rule is based on observing the current stock level relative to capacity.

**Decision Rule:**
- **If** the current stock \( S_t \) is greater than 70% of the capacity, **defect**.
- **Else**, **cooperate**.

This approach allows for early exploitation when resources are abundant while switching to cooperation as the stock decreases, promoting sustainability for future rounds. 

**Answer:**
The strategy is to defect when the current stock exceeds 70% of the capacity and cooperate otherwise. This ensures a balance between maximizing immediate gains and maintaining sustainable resource levels.

\boxed{\text{Defect if } S_t > 0.7 \times \text{Capacity; else, Cooperate}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_278 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing immediate gains while preventing complete resource collapse, we can implement a threshold-based strategy. This approach involves defecting when the stock is above a certain threshold to maximize current benefits and cooperating below that threshold to ensure some future payoffs.

### Approach
1. **Threshold Setting**: We set a threshold at 70% of the capacity. If the current stock exceeds this threshold, we choose to defect (D) to maximize our immediate gain.
2. **Cooperation Below Threshold**: When the stock is below or equal to the threshold, we cooperate (C) to avoid depleting the resource too quickly and ensure some future benefits.

This strategy balances exploiting the resource when it's abundant while conserving it when it becomes scarce.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(observation):
    stock = observation['stock']
    capacity = observation['capacity']
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity  # Set threshold at 70% of capacity
    
    if stock > threshold:
        return 'D'  # Defect when stock is above the threshold
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate when stock is below or equal to the threshold
```

### Explanation
- **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold is calculated as 70% of the total capacity. This value can be adjusted based on specific needs, but 70% provides a balance between exploitation and conservation.
- **Decision Making**: In each round, the AI checks if the current stock exceeds the threshold. If it does, the AI defects to gain more immediately. If not, it cooperates to maintain sustainable resource levels.

This approach ensures that we maximize immediate gains while preventing the complete depletion of the resource, thus allowing for some future exploitation opportunities.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_279 = '''
To address the problem, we'll outline an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on observed game dynamics and resource levels. The approach involves starting with cooperation, monitoring consumption trends, adapting to significant defections, and exploiting resources towards the end of the game.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating to foster a positive environment and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Monitor Consumption Trends**: Track excess consumption beyond what would occur if everyone cooperated. This helps identify when other players are defecting.
3. **Adaptive Defection**: If excess consumption indicates significant defection, switch strategies to defect in subsequent rounds.
4. **Stock Level Check**: Cooperate when resources are abundant but defect if the stock drops below a critical threshold, signaling potential depletion.
5. **Endgame Exploitation**: Near the end of the game, defect to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
def adaptive_strategy(round_number, current_stock, total_players, previous_rounds_actions):
    capacity = 100  # Assuming a maximum stock level; adjust based on actual problem constraints.
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate excess consumption from the last round
    last_round_stock_before = previous_rounds_actions[-1]['stock_before']
    total_consumption_last_round = previous_rounds_actions[-1]['total_consumption']
    expected_cooperative_total = last_round_stock_before / 2
    excess_consumption = total_consumption_last_round - expected_cooperative_total
    
    # Track moving average of excess consumption over the last few rounds (e.g., last 5)
    window_size = min(5, len(previous_rounds_actions))
    recent_excesses = [prev['excess'] for prev in previous_rounds_actions[-window_size:]]
    if len(recent_excesses) > 0:
        average_excess = sum(recent_excesses) / len(recent_excesses)
    else:
        average_excess = 0
    
    # Determine action based on conditions
    if current_stock < 0.3 * capacity:
        return 'D'
    elif average_excess > (capacity * 0.1):  # Threshold example: 10% of capacity as excess
        return 'D'
    elif round_number >= total_players - (total_players / 4):
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# Example usage:
previous_rounds = [
    {'stock_before': 100, 'total_consumption': 50, 'excess': 0},
    {'stock_before': 90, 'total_consumption': 60, 'excess': 10}
]

action = adaptive_strategy(3, 80, 10, previous_rounds)
print("Action:", action)
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by cooperating to encourage a positive loop where others might also cooperate.
- **Excess Consumption Monitoring**: By calculating how much more is consumed than expected under full cooperation, the strategy identifies when others are defecting. This helps in deciding whether to continue cooperating or switch to defecting.
- **Stock Threshold Check**: Cooperating when resources are abundant maintains a sustainable resource level. Defecting below a critical threshold prevents getting stuck with minimal returns later.
- **Adaptive Defection**: Reacting to significant excess consumption ensures timely adaptation to others' strategies, preventing undue losses from cooperating while others defect.
- **Endgame Exploitation**: Near the end of the game, defecting maximizes immediate payoffs without worrying about future rounds, which no longer exist.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior and resource levels to maximize individual payoff.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_280 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by balancing cooperation for sustainability with defection to exploit opponents.

**Strategy Overview:**
1. **Initial Cooperation (First 25% of Rounds):** Cooperate to encourage a sustainable resource level and observe opponents' behavior.
2. **Adaptive Defection in Middle Rounds:** Track opponents' actions; if more than 30% defect, switch to defecting to exploit the situation.
3. **Late Round Exploitation (Last 25% of Rounds):** Defect maximally to maximize immediate payoff with no future rounds to penalize.

**Decision Rules:**
- **Early Phase:** Cooperate in the first quarter of rounds to build a resource buffer and encourage others' cooperation.
- **Middle Phase:** Monitor opponents. If >30% defect, switch to defecting to exploit higher payoffs.
- **Late Phase:** Defect in final rounds to maximize gains without future repercussions.

**Stock Threshold Adjustment:**
- Track stock level. If below capacity/2, indicating over-consumption, start defecting earlier.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Determine cooperation and late round thresholds (e.g., first 25% and last 25% of rounds).
   - Set defect threshold proportion (e.g., 30%).

2. **Each Round Execution:**
   - If in early phase, Cooperate.
   - In middle phase:
     - Calculate opponents' defect proportion from previous rounds.
     - If above threshold or stock below capacity/2, Defect; else, Cooperate.
   - In late phase, always Defect.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, history, stock):
    cooperation_threshold = int(total_rounds * 0.25)
    late_round_start = int(total_rounds * 0.75)
    
    if current_round <= cooperation_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round > late_round_start:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate defect proportion in recent rounds
        recent_defects = sum(1 for h in history[-5:] for a in h['actions'] if a == 'D')
        total_actions = 5 * n  # assuming last 5 rounds, each with n players
        defect_proportion = recent_defects / total_actions
        
        # Check stock level
        if stock < capacity * 0.5 or defect_proportion > 0.3:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

**Rationale:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Builds a sustainable resource base, encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Adaptive Defection:** Reacts to opponents' behaviors, exploiting situations where they over-consume.
- **Late Round Exploitation:** Maximizes payoffs in final rounds without future penalties.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponents and resource conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_281 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' cooperation while adapting to their behavior over multiple rounds.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Testing opponents' reactions and maximizing immediate gain.

2. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: No future rounds, so prioritize maximum current payoff.

3. **Middle Rounds:**
   a. Calculate the average cooperation rate of opponents over the previous two rounds.
   b. If cooperation rate > 60%:
      - **Action:** Defect (D)
        - Exploit others' willingness to Cooperate for higher immediate gain.
   c. Else:
      - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
        - Mitigate further stock depletion and encourage sustainable behavior.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Low Stock Levels:**
  - If current stock is below 30% of capacity, adjust the threshold to 50%. Cooperate more frequently to preserve the remaining stock and allow growth for future rounds.

### Exploitative Mindset:

The strategy exploits opponents by defecting when they cooperate, maximizing immediate gains. When defecting becomes prevalent, switching to cooperation helps sustain the resource, ensuring some recovery for continued exploitation in later rounds.

This approach is adaptive, exploiting others' behaviors while mitigating long-term negative impacts on stock levels when necessary. It doesn't rely on coordination, making it robust against diverse opponent strategies.

---

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, capacity, r, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return D
    
    if round_number == r:
        return D
    
    # Calculate average cooperation rate of opponents in last two rounds
    recent_rounds = get_last_n_rounds(history, min(2, round_number - 1))
    opp_coop_rate = calculate_opp_coop_rate(recent_rounds)
    
    # Check if stock is low
    if current_stock < 0.3 * capacity:
        threshold = 50
    else:
        threshold = 60
    
    if opp_coop_rate > threshold:
        return D
    else:
        return C

def calculate_opp_coop_rate(rounds):
    total_actions = sum(len(round['actions']) for round in rounds)
    coop_actions = sum(1 for round in rounds for action in round['actions'] if action == 'C')
    return (coop_actions / total_actions) * 100
```

---

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with sustainable play, adapting dynamically to opponents' actions while considering the state of the common pool resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_282 = '''
To address the problem of exploiting a shared resource sustainably while considering others' actions, we can outline a strategic approach that balances exploitation with preservation. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Step 1: Initial Exploitation
- **Action:** Defect in the first few rounds to test the impact on the stock and observe opponents' behavior.
- **Rationale:** Early defecting allows you to gauge how others respond and assess the resource's resilience.

### Step 2: Monitor Opponents' Behavior
- **Calculate Average Cooperation Rate:** Determine the percentage of times opponents choose to Cooperate (C) over recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
- **Rationale:** This helps identify patterns in their behavior, indicating whether they are more inclined to exploit or preserve.

### Step 3: Assess Current Stock Level
- **Check Stock Relative to Capacity:** Compare the current stock level (S_t) to the initial capacity. Use thresholds like 70%, 50%, and 30% as markers for high, moderate, and low stock levels.
- **Rationale:** The stock's health determines how much exploitation is sustainable without risking collapse.

### Step 4: Decision Based on Opponents' Cooperation and Stock Level
- **If opponents are mostly Cooperating (e.g., >60%) AND the stock is healthy (e.g., >70% capacity):**
  - **Action:** Defect.
  - **Rationale:** Exploit while others preserve, as the resource can sustain your higher consumption without significant depletion.

- **Else if opponents are mostly Defecting (<50% cooperation) OR the stock is low (<30% capacity):**
  - **Action:** Cooperate.
  - **Rationale:** Preserve the resource to prevent rapid depletion and ensure future exploitation opportunities.

- **In intermediate cases (e.g., moderate cooperation and stock level):**
  - **Action:** Choose based on a weighted average, leaning towards defecting if opponents' cooperation is somewhat high and the stock remains relatively strong.

### Step 5: Final Rounds Adjustment
- **Last 10% of Rounds:**
  - **Action:** Cooperate.
  - **Rationale:** Ensure the resource doesn't crash in the final rounds, maximizing remaining payoffs by maintaining a sustainable level.

### Step 6: Adaptive Adjustments
- **Analyze Outcomes Post-Round:**
  - If defecting led to significant stock decrease, reduce future defecting to prevent collapse.
  - If defecting didn't harm the stock much (due to high growth), continue exploiting cautiously.

### Summary of Strategy:
1. **Early Exploitation:** Start by defecting to test and observe.
2. **Monitor Opponents:** Track their cooperation rate to predict behavior.
3. **Stock Assessment:** Use thresholds to gauge resource health.
4. **Adaptive Exploitation/Preservation:**
   - Defect when opponents cooperate and the stock is robust.
   - Cooperate when opponents defect or the stock is low.
5. **Final Preservation:** Ensure sustainability in the end game.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to maximize exploitation while preventing resource collapse.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_283 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing immediate payoffs while adapting to other players' behaviors and managing the common pool's sustainability.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Immediate Payoff Maximization**: Default to defecting (D) to gain higher immediate payoffs. This exploits others who may cooperate or have different strategies.

2. **Stock Management**: Monitor the stock level to prevent rapid depletion, ensuring long-term exploitation opportunities. If the stock is too low, switch to cooperating temporarily to allow regrowth.

3. **Adaptation Based on Others' Actions**: Adjust strategy based on opponents' choices. Defect more if others cooperate; consider cooperation if many defect to avoid stock collapse.

4. **Round Dynamics**: Be cautious in early rounds, exploit near the end when future payoffs are irrelevant.

### Decision Rules

- **Default Action**: Cooperate only if necessary to prevent stock collapse or when defecting would lead to rapid depletion.
  
- **Stock Thresholds**:
  - If stock ≤ 25% of capacity: Cooperate to allow regrowth.
  - If stock > 75% of capacity: Defect aggressively as high growth potential allows more exploitation.

- **Adaptive Cooperation**: If the majority defects, cooperate to prevent stock depletion; if most cooperate, defect to exploit.

- **Round-Specific Actions**:
  - **First Round**: Defect to test others' reactions.
  - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of rounds)**: Defect maximally as future payoffs don't matter.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **Initial Stock Near Capacity**: Start with defecting, as high growth can sustain more exploitation.
- **Stock Near Zero**: Switch to cooperating to rebuild the stock for potential future gains.
- **High Defection Rate Among Others**: Cooperate more to prevent collapse and ensure sustainable exploitation in later rounds.

### Pseudocode

```python
def strategy(history, state, parameters):
    n = parameters['n']
    r = parameters['r']
    capacity = parameters['capacity']
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    stock = state['stock']

    # Determine number of Cooperators and Defectors in last round
    if history:
        last_round_actions = [action[-1] for action in history]
        num_defectors = sum(1 for a in last_round_actions if a == 'D')
    else:
        num_defectors = 0

    # Stock-based decisions
    if stock <= capacity * 0.25:
        return 'C'
    elif stock > capacity * 0.75:
        return 'D'

    # Adaptive based on others' actions
    if num_defectors / n >= 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

    # Round-specific decisions
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'D'
    elif current_round > r * 0.9:  # Last 10% of rounds
        return 'D'
```

### Summary

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to other players' actions and stock levels. By defecting when beneficial and cooperating when necessary, it aims to maximize cumulative payoffs while preventing rapid resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_284 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing individual payoff by exploiting opponents' actions while maintaining adaptability. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **High Stock (S > 0.8 * capacity):** Exploit by defecting if there are enough cooperators; otherwise, cooperate to prevent stock depletion.
   - **Medium Stock (0.5 * capacity ≤ S ≤ 0.8 * capacity):** Defect if many opponents cooperate; else, cooperate to sustain the resource.
   - **Low Stock (S < 0.5 * capacity):** Prioritize cooperation to allow recovery and ensure future gains.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Defect to test opponent reactions and gain immediate payoff.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize final payout, as there's no future impact.

3. **Adaptive Elements:**
   - Track opponents' past actions to adjust thresholds dynamically.
   - If opponents frequently defect, lower cooperation thresholds to preserve the stock.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, current_round):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    capacity = max_stock_level

    S_high = 0.8 * capacity
    S_med = 0.5 * capacity

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'D'
    elif current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > S_high:
            # Exploit when opponents cooperate more
            opp_coop_ratio = count_opponents_cooperation(history) / n
            if opp_coop_ratio >= 0.6:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        elif S_med <= current_stock <= S_high:
            # Balance exploitation and sustainability
            total_consumption = calculate_total_consumption(history)
            stock_after = current_stock - total_consumption
            growth = 2 * stock_after * (1 - stock_after / capacity)
            new_stock = min(stock_after + growth, capacity)

            if new_stock > S_high:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        else:
            # Preserve the resource for future rounds
            return 'C'

    # Additional checks based on stock projections and opponent behavior (simplified here)
```

### Explanation

- **High Stock:** Exploit by defecting when opponents are likely to cooperate, maximizing immediate gains.
- **Medium Stock:** Balance between exploiting cooperators and cooperating to prevent rapid depletion.
- **Low Stock:** Focus on cooperation to allow the resource to recover, ensuring future sustainability.

This strategy dynamically adapts based on current stock levels and observed opponent behaviors, balancing short-term exploitation with long-term resource preservation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_285 = '''
To address the problem, we'll outline a strategic approach that balances exploiting opponents and preserving the game state for future rounds. The strategy adapts based on observed behavior and the current state of the game.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperating Phase**: Begin by cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage others to cooperate as well.
2. **Observation Period**: Use initial rounds to gather data on opponents' behaviors.
3. **Dynamic Thresholding**: Adjust the decision threshold based on the current stock level and the remaining number of rounds. Higher thresholds early in the game ensure that defecting doesn't deplete the stock too much, allowing for future exploitation.
4. **Opponent Behavior Analysis**: Track the cooperation rate of opponents over recent rounds to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
5. **Stock Preservation**: If the stock drops below a critical level, switch to full cooperation to prevent further depletion and allow recovery.

        stock (float): Current stock level.
        capacity (float): Maximum possible stock level.

    Returns:
        int: 1 for Cooperate, 0 for Defect
    """
    # First few rounds: always Cooperate to encourage others
    if current_round <= 3:
        return 1
    
    # Calculate average cooperation rate of opponents in recent rounds

    start_index = max(0, len(opponent_actions[0]) - recent_rounds)
    total_cooperate = 0
    total_opponents = len(opponent_actions)
    
    for opp in opponent_actions:
        if len(opp) > start_index:
            total_cooperate += sum(opp[start_index:])
            
    avg_cooperate_rate = total_cooperate / (total_opponents * recent_rounds)
    
    # Determine threshold based on progress through the game
    progress = current_round / total_rounds
    if progress < 0.2:  # Early stage
        threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    elif progress < 0.6:  # Mid stage
        threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    else:  # Late stage
        threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    
    # Critical level below which we always Cooperate
    critical_level = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if stock > threshold and avg_cooperate_rate > 0.6:
        return 0  # Defect if conditions are met
    elif stock < critical_level:
        return 1  # Cooperate to preserve stock
    else:
        return 1  # Default to Cooperate
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Phase**: The strategy starts by cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage mutual cooperation, which helps maintain a higher stock level for longer.
- **Observation and Adaptation**: By analyzing opponents' past actions, the strategy adapts to their tendencies. If most opponents are cooperating, it's safe to defect to gain more payoff.
- **Dynamic Thresholding**: The threshold for deciding to defect decreases as the game progresses, ensuring that in later rounds, the strategy focuses on preserving what's left of the stock for fewer future opportunities.
- **Critical Stock Level**: To prevent irreversible depletion, a critical level is set. Once the stock falls below this level, cooperation is enforced to allow recovery through growth.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on game progress and opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_286 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing immediate payoffs while adapting to the game's dynamics and opponents' behaviors. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Early Rounds (Defect Aggressively):** Exploit high stock levels by defecting to gain maximum immediate payoff.
2. **Mid Rounds (Adapt Based on Opponents):** Monitor others' actions; if too many defect, switch to cooperation to prevent rapid depletion.
3. **Late Rounds (Maximize Immediate Gain):** Shift towards defecting more as future rounds are limited, focusing on immediate payoffs.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Current Stock Level:**
   - **High Stock (>70% capacity):** Defect to maximize gains.
   - **Moderate Stock (30%-70% capacity):** Balance between defecting and cooperating based on others' actions.
   - **Low Stock (<30% capacity):** Cooperate to prevent collapse.

2. **Opponents' Behavior:**
   - If more than half of players are defecting, switch to cooperation to preserve the resource.
   - Otherwise, continue defecting to exploit others' cooperation.

3. **Round Number:**
   - In early rounds (first half), prioritize defecting.
   - In later rounds, especially the last few, focus on maximizing immediate gains through defecting.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Start with defecting to take advantage of high initial stock.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Defect more to maximize payoffs without worrying about long-term sustainability.
- **Stock Near Zero:** Cooperate to allow some regrowth and prevent collapse.

### Pseudocode Logic:

```python
for each round t in 1..r:
    observe current stock S, number of defectors D_players, cooperators C_players
    if early_rounds(t) or (S > threshold_high):
        action = 'D'
    elif S < threshold_low:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        if proportion_defectors > threshold_cooperate:

        else:
            action = 'D'
    return action

def early_rounds(t, r):
    return t <= r / 2
```

### Thresholds:
- **threshold_high:** 70% of capacity.
- **threshold_low:** 30% of capacity.
- **proportion_defectors:** If more than 50% are defecting.

This strategy balances exploiting immediate gains with adapting to sustain resource levels, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' cooperation while preserving the resource enough for future gains.

**Strategy Overview:**
- **Initial Exploration:** Start with defection to test others' responses and gain immediate payoffs.
- **Stock Health Monitoring:** Track the stock level each round. Use a dynamic threshold to decide between defecting or cooperating, adjusting based on current stock and rounds remaining.
- **Adaptation Based on Opponents:** Monitor opponents' actions; if most are defecting, switch to cooperation to prevent rapid depletion.
- **Endgame Handling:** Increase defection in later rounds to maximize immediate gains without worrying about future rounds.

**Decision Rules:**
1. **First Round:** Defect to exploit potential cooperation and gain higher payoff.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (Early-Mid Game):**
   - If current stock > dynamic threshold, defect.
   - Else, check recent opponents' actions; if <40% defecting, continue defecting; else cooperate.
3. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20% of total rounds):** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff.

**Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
- Early rounds: Higher threshold (e.g., 70-80% capacity).
- Mid game: Lower threshold (e.g., around 60%).
- Late game: Further lower to encourage more defection as future payoffs diminish.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow regrowth.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Defect safely, leveraging optimal growth conditions.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

For each round t in 1 to total_rounds:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    others_actions = get_previous_rounds_actions()
    
    if t == total_rounds:  # Last round
        choose D (defect)
    else:
        # Calculate threshold based on rounds remaining
        progress = t / total_rounds
        adjusted_threshold = interpolate(progress, [0.8, 0.6, 0.4])

                choose D
            else:
                choose C
        
    update defect_history with my choice
    
# Function to adjust threshold based on progress through rounds
def interpolate(progress, thresholds):

    elif progress <= 0.8:
        return thresholds[1] * capacity
    else:
        return thresholds[2] * capacity

**Conclusion:**
This strategy balances exploitation with resource preservation, adapting to opponents' behavior and stock health to maximize payoffs while preventing mutual over-exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_288 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Decision Rules:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an Exploit mode in the first 3 rounds by defecting to test others' behavior.
   - Set thresholds for switching modes:
     - Cooperators Threshold (CT): If more than 60% of players Cooperate in recent rounds, consider switching.
     - Stock Threshold (ST): If stock drops below 70% of capacity, consider switching.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - After each round, record the number of Cooperators and Defectors.
   - Track the stock level at the end of each round to monitor trends.

3. **Mode Assessment:**
   - Calculate the percentage of Defectors in the last 3 rounds.
   - Compare current stock with previous rounds to determine if it's increasing, decreasing, or stable.

4. **Decision Logic:**
   - **Exploit Mode (Default):** If others are mostly Cooperating (Defectors < CT) and stock > ST:
     - Defect to exploit the resource.
   - **Preserve Mode:** If either:
     - Number of Defectors exceeds CT, indicating others are exploiting more.
     - Stock drops below ST, indicating potential resource depletion.
     - Switch to Cooperate to help preserve the resource.

5. **Adaptation:**
   - Continuously monitor the number of Defectors and stock trends.
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on observed behavior (e.g., increase CT if others start defecting more frequently).

6. **Final Round Handling:**
   - In the last round, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1-3):**
   - Choose to Defect each round to gauge others' actions and initial stock dynamics.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - For rounds beyond the initial phase:
     a. Calculate the percentage of Defectors in the last 3 rounds.
     b. Check if current stock is above or below the established ST (70%).
     c. If Defectors < CT (60%) and stock > ST, continue Defecting.
     d. If Defectors ≥ CT or stock ≤ ST, switch to Cooperate.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - After each round where mode is switched, reassess thresholds based on new data.
   - For example, if others start defecting more frequently, lower the CT threshold to switch modes sooner in future rounds.

4. **Final Round Execution:**
   - Regardless of current mode, choose to Defect in the last round to secure maximum payoff.

**Example Walkthrough:**

- **Round 1:** Defect (Exploit mode).
- **Round 2:** Defect.
- **Round 3:** Defect.
- **Round 4:** Check data from Rounds 1-3. Suppose 70% Cooperated and stock is at 80%.
   - Since Cooperators > CT (Defectors < 30%) and stock > ST, continue Defecting.
- **Round 5:** Similar to Round 4, continue Exploit mode.
- **Round 6:** Observations show 40% Cooperated, and stock dropped to 65%.
   - Stock below ST (70%), switch to Preserve mode: Cooperate.
- **Round 7:** Continue Cooperating if others' behavior hasn't changed significantly.
- **...**
- **Final Round (e.g., Round 10):** Defect, regardless of previous mode.

This strategy balances short-term exploitation with long-term preservation based on observed player behavior and resource levels.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_289 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and preservation in a repeated game scenario, we propose a strategy that adapts based on the current stock level relative to capacity. The strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining sustainable resource levels for future gains.

### Approach
The strategy involves three key phases:
1. **Early Exploitation Phase**: Defect when the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) to exploit others' cooperation.
2. **Mid-Game Preservation Phase**: Cooperate when the stock falls below the threshold to help rebuild and preserve the resource for future exploitation.
3. **Endgame Exploitation Phase**: Defect in the final few rounds to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future consequences.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(stock_level, capacity):
    # Threshold set at 50% of capacity
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    # Check if it's one of the last few rounds (example: last 10% of possible rounds)
    # Assuming we have knowledge of total rounds, but since it's not provided, this part is illustrative.
    # In a real scenario, we might adjust based on observed patterns or time remaining.
    
    # For simplicity, let's assume the endgame phase starts when stock is very low
    # and/or towards the end if known.
    # Here, we'll ignore the endgame for code brevity but mention it in comments.

    # Early exploitation: defect if stock is above threshold
    if stock_level > threshold:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        return "Cooperate"

# Example usage:
current_stock = 80
total_capacity = 100

action = decide_action(current_stock, total_capacity)
print(f"Current action: {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **Threshold Setting**: The threshold is set at 50% of the resource capacity. This means that as long as the stock level exceeds this threshold, defecting (exploiting others) is beneficial.
- **Cooperation Phase**: When the stock drops below the threshold, cooperation becomes the strategy to rebuild and preserve resources for future exploitation.
- **Endgame Handling**: Although not explicitly handled in the code due to lack of round information, in practice, defecting in the final rounds can maximize immediate gains without worrying about long-term sustainability.

This approach ensures a balance between exploiting others when possible and preserving resources when necessary, leading to a sustainable yet profitable strategy.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Strategy:**

The goal is to design a strategy that maximizes your payoff in each round while considering the impact on future rounds. This involves balancing between defecting (to gain more immediately) and cooperating (to preserve the stock for future gains). The strategy adapts based on the current state of the stock and the behavior observed from other players.

**1. Initial Setup:**
   - **Upper Threshold (UT):** Starts at 60% of capacity.
   - **Lower Threshold (LT):** Starts at 40% of capacity.
   - These thresholds dynamically adjust over time to balance exploitation and sustainability.

**2. Decision-Making in Each Round:**
   a. **Calculate P_defect:** Determine the proportion of players who defected in the previous round.
   
   b. **Check Defection Conditions:**
      - If current stock (S) > UT AND P_defect < 30%:
        - Choose to defect.
      - Else:
        - Choose to cooperate.

**3. Dynamic Adjustment of Thresholds:**
   - After each round, adjust UT and LT:
     - **UT:** Decreases by 2% each round to encourage more cooperation as the game progresses.
     - **LT:** Increases by 2% each round to promote defecting when the stock is still relatively high but not excessively so.

**4. Adaptation Based on Observations:**
   - If defecting leads to a significant drop in the stock (e.g., S decreases by more than 10%), consider lowering UT even further or increasing LT in subsequent rounds.
   - Conversely, if cooperating leads to stable or increasing stocks, maintain or slightly adjust the thresholds accordingly.

**5. Endgame Considerations:**
   - As the number of remaining rounds decreases, prioritize cooperation to ensure sustainable payoffs in the final rounds rather than causing rapid depletion that benefits no one.

**Summary of Strategy:**

- **Defect** when:
  - The current stock is above a dynamically decreasing threshold (starting at 60%).
  - Fewer than 30% of players defected in the previous round.
  
- **Cooperate** otherwise, especially as thresholds adjust to encourage sustainability.

This adaptive approach allows for exploiting opportunities when it's safe and responsible, while preventing excessive depletion that could harm long-term gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_291 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round based on current stock levels, opponents' behaviors, and future potential gains, we propose a strategy that adapts dynamically using historical data and predictions. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round Decision**:
   - Observe the initial stock level.
   - If the stock is above a predefined threshold (e.g., half of the capacity), defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to preserve the stock for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Middle Rounds)**:
   - Track opponents' past behavior to estimate their likelihood of defecting or cooperating.
   - Use these estimates to simulate the expected outcomes if you choose to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D).
   - Calculate the immediate payoff and predict the resulting stock level for both choices.
   - Compare the total expected payoffs, considering future gains from each action's impact on the stock.

3. **Last Few Rounds**:
   - Shift towards defecting more to maximize immediate payoffs since there's less concern about preserving the stock for future rounds.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - Continuously update thresholds and predictions based on actual outcomes after each round.
   - Adjust cooperation rates in response to opponents' behaviors, allowing exploitation of predictable players.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Initial Round (Round 1)**:
   - Set an initial threshold, typically half the capacity.
   - If the current stock exceeds this threshold, defect; otherwise, cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   a. For each opponent, calculate their historical defection rate based on past rounds.
   b. Estimate expected consumption for both your cooperation and defection scenarios using these rates.
   c. Simulate the resulting stock levels after each scenario.
   d. Compare the immediate payoffs and predict future gains from each action's impact on the stock.
   e. Choose the action (C or D) that yields a higher total expected payoff.

3. **Last Few Rounds**:
   - Increase defection rate to prioritize immediate payoffs over preserving the stock for non-existent future rounds.

4. **Adaptation and Learning**:
   - After each round, update opponents' defection rates.
   - Adjust thresholds based on observed growth trends and actual outcomes.
   - Refine future payoff predictions using updated data.

### Conclusion

This strategy dynamically balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to opponents' behaviors and predicting stock impacts. It allows exploitation of cooperation when beneficial while preserving resources for future rounds, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_292 = '''
To maximize your payoff over multiple rounds, you should employ a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the optimal strategy:

1. **First Round: Cooperate**
   - Start by Cooperating in the first round. This allows others to also Cooperate, leading to moderate consumption and significant regrowth, maintaining the resource for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1): Conditional Defection Based on Stock Level**
   - For each subsequent round until the second-to-last round:
     - If the current stock level is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), choose to Defect.
       - Rationale: When the resource is abundant, defecting allows you to maximize your immediate payoff while still enabling some regrowth, ensuring sustainability for future rounds.
     - If the current stock level is below this threshold, Cooperate instead.
       - Rationale: Preserving the resource when it's low prevents collapse and ensures that there will be enough left for subsequent rounds.

3. **Last Round (Round r): Defect**
   - In the final round, choose to Defect regardless of the stock level. Since there are no future rounds to consider, maximizing your immediate payoff is optimal without worrying about depleting the resource further.

### Summary of the Strategy:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Begin with Cooperate to foster a sustainable environment.
- **Threshold-Based Defection:** From round 2 onwards, defect if the stock is sufficiently high; otherwise, cooperate to preserve resources.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** Defect in the last round to maximize your payoff without concern for future rounds.

This strategy optimally balances exploitation and preservation, ensuring maximum cumulative payoff while maintaining resource sustainability throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_293 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' behaviors while balancing resource sustainability.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round (t=1):**
   - Always Defect to exploit potential cooperators and test their reactions.

2. **Middle Rounds (2 ≤ t < r-1):**
   - **High Stock (S > 75% capacity):** If fewer than half of opponents defected last round, defect again to exploit.
   - **Moderate Stock (25% < S ≤ 75%):** 
     - Defect if less than a third of opponents defected previously.
     - Cooperate if more than a third defected to prevent further depletion.
   - **Low Stock (S ≤ 25%):** Always Cooperate to allow stock recovery.

3. **Last Two Rounds (t ≥ r-1):**
   - Defect if stock is sufficiently high; otherwise, cooperate slightly to ensure some payoff.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Default to Defect.
- **Low Stock Early On:** Shift towards Cooperation sooner.
- **Last Round:** Defect for maximum gain regardless of future impact.

### Strategy Summary:

- Start with Defection to exploit others' potential cooperation.
- Adapt based on stock levels and opponents' defect rates, switching to Cooperation when necessary to prevent resource collapse.
- In final rounds, prioritize Defection to maximize payoff without concern for future sustainability.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource preservation, ensuring adaptability against various opponent behaviors.

### Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

The strategy is designed to exploit opponents' cooperation tendencies while ensuring long-term sustainability. It adapts dynamically based on stock levels, opponent behavior, and round progression.

#### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Always Defect (D). The first round has no history, so defecting maximizes immediate payoff while exploiting any potential cooperators.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the number of opponents who Cooperated in the previous round.
   - Evaluate current stock level and capacity.

3. **Defection Conditions:**
   - If 60% or fewer opponents Cooperated last round, Defect to exploit their tendency to sustain the pool for others' benefit.
   - If stock is above 80% of capacity, Defect since high stock can absorb exploitation without collapsing.

4. **Cooperation Conditions:**
   - If stock is below 60% of capacity, Cooperate to prevent collapse and ensure future payoffs.
   - If 70% or more opponents Cooperated last round, Cooperate to maintain a sustainable equilibrium.

5. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Defect unconditionally since there's no future payoff to consider.

#### **Pseudocode**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, stock_level, capacity, n, opponent_actions):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate of opponents in previous round
    num_cooperators = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions[-1] if action == 'C')
    coop_rate = num_cooperators / (n - 1)  # Exclude self
    
    # Check stock level relative to capacity
    if stock_level <= 0.6 * capacity:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent collapse
    
    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'  # Last round, defect for maximum payoff
    
    if coop_rate >= 0.7:
        return 'C'  # Sustain pool by cooperating with many cooperators
    else:
        return 'D'  # Exploit opponents who are less likely to cooperate
    
    # If stock is high and not last round, defect
    if stock_level > 0.8 * capacity:
        return 'D'
    
    # Default case (unlikely reached)
    return 'C'
```

#### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Always Defect to exploit potential cooperators.
- **Last Round:** Defect for maximum immediate payoff, no future impact.
- **Low Stock (<60% capacity):** Cooperate to prevent collapse and ensure future payoffs.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponent behavior and game state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_295 = '''
To maximize your payoff while considering the impact of others' strategies, follow this adaptive strategy:

1. **Initial Exploration**: Start by defecting in the first few rounds to observe how other players respond and assess the impact on the stock.

2. **Monitor Opponents' Behavior**: Keep track of how many players cooperate or defect each round. This helps predict future behavior and decide your next move.

3. **Stock Threshold Check**: 
   - If the current stock is above 70% of capacity, continue defecting because there's enough buffer for growth.
   - If the stock drops below 40%, switch to cooperating to allow regrowth and prevent a crash.

4. **Opponent Cooperation Rate**:
   - If more than half of the opponents cooperated in the previous round, defect this round to exploit their cooperation.
   - If fewer than half cooperated, cooperate this round to support stock sustainability.

5. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last 20% of rounds, prioritize defecting to maximize immediate gains without worrying about future impacts.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Defection**: Begin by defecting to test others' reactions and gauge how much the stock changes with this action.

2. **Observe Stock Changes**: Track how your defection affects the stock. If it remains high, continue exploiting; if it drops significantly, consider cooperating next round.

3. **Adapt Based on Opponents**:
   - If most opponents cooperate (over 50%), defect to gain more without causing too much depletion.
   - If most defect, switch to cooperation to prevent a crash and allow the stock to recover in future rounds.

4. **Stock Sustainability**: Maintain your strategy by ensuring the stock doesn't drop below critical levels. Cooperate if necessary to keep the system sustainable for longer-term gains.

5. **Final Rounds Focus**: As the game nears its end, focus on maximizing your immediate payoff through defection since there's no future impact to consider.

**Answer:**

Your optimal strategy is a dynamic approach that adapts based on the current stock level and others' actions:

1. **Start by defecting** in the initial rounds.
2. **Cooperate if**:
   - The stock drops below 40% of capacity, or
   - Fewer than half of the opponents cooperated last round.
3. **Defect if**:
   - The stock is above 70%, or
   - More than half of the opponents cooperated last round.
4. **Shift to defecting in the final 20%** of rounds regardless of other conditions.

This strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable exploitation, maximizing your total payoff over time.

$\boxed{\text{Defect when others cooperate and stock is high; cooperate otherwise}}$

description_EXPLOITATIVE_296 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing immediate payoffs while considering the sustainability of the common pool. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to avoid sudden stock depletion and observe others' behavior.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate potential payoffs for Cooperating (C) and Defecting (D).
   - Consider current stock levels, remaining rounds, and historical actions of other players.
3. **Final Rounds**: Prioritize defecting to maximize immediate gains as future impacts are limited.

### Detailed Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale**: Avoid crashing the system early and observe others' initial moves.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-5)**:
   - **Current Stock Check**:
     - If stock > 80% of capacity: Defect (D) for higher payoff.
     - Else: Cooperate (C) to prevent rapid depletion.
   - **Historical Behavior Adjustment**:
     - Track others' defection rate in the last 3 rounds.
     - If more than 50% defect, increase tendency to cooperate to avoid crash.
     - Else, continue defecting for higher payoff.

3. **Final Few Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Defect (D)
   - **Rationale**: Maximize immediate gains with minimal concern for future rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Stock Close to Capacity**:
  - Defect (D) as growth will replenish, allowing higher payoff without long-term harm.
  
- **Low Stock Levels**:
  - Cooperate (C) to prevent stock crash and ensure sustainable play.

### Implementation Heuristics:

- Use thresholds (e.g., 80% capacity) for defection based on remaining rounds and stock levels.
- Adjust cooperation rate dynamically based on others' historical behavior to exploit cooperative tendencies while mitigating crashes from widespread defection.

This strategy balances immediate payoff exploitation with sustainability considerations, adapting to both game dynamics and opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_297 = '''
To address the problem, we can implement a strategy that allows for controlled exploitation of the common pool resource while ensuring its sustainability. The approach involves defecting (overusing) when the resource stock is sufficiently high and cooperating to conserve the resource when it becomes depleted.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Defection:** Start by defecting in the first round to maximize immediate gain, as the stock is at its maximum capacity.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels:** After each round, check the current level of the common pool resource (S).
3. **Threshold-Based Decision-Making:** Use a predetermined threshold (e.g., 60% of the initial capacity) to decide whether to defect or cooperate:
   - If S is above the threshold, continue defecting.
   - If S drops below the threshold, switch to cooperation to allow the resource to recover.

**Answer:**

The strategy involves defecting when the common pool resource exceeds a certain threshold and cooperating otherwise. This balance prevents over-depletion while allowing for exploitation.

```python
def decision(S, capacity, n):
    # Threshold set at 60% of capacity as an example
    threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    if S > threshold:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        return "Cooperate"
```

This strategy helps maintain the resource level by allowing controlled exploitation when the stock is healthy and promoting conservation when it's low, thus sustaining the resource for future use.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_298 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploitation with preservation of the resource while adapting to opponents' actions. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
1. **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate to observe opponent behavior and build trust.
2. **Exploitation Phase**: Defect when stock is high and most players cooperate.
3. **Preservation Phase**: Cooperate if stock is low or many defect, encouraging replenishment.
4. **Terminal Rounds**: Defect in the last few rounds to maximize immediate payoff.

### Decision Rules
1. **First Few Rounds (Round < 5)**: Cooperate to gather information and encourage cooperation among others.
2. **Last Few Rounds (r - Round < 5)**: Defect to exploit the remaining stock without concern for future depletion.
3. **Middle Rounds**:
   - Calculate the current stock relative to capacity.
   - Track opponents' cooperation rate over recent rounds.
   - If stock is above a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) and most players cooperate, defect to gain more.
   - If stock is low or many defect, cooperate to preserve resources.

### Thresholds and Adjustments
- **Cooperation Threshold**: Start with 70% of capacity; adjust based on how opponents respond. Increase if exploitation leads to rapid depletion, decrease if preservation allows sustained high stock.
- **Opponent Cooperation Rate**: If most players (e.g., >70%) cooperate in recent rounds, defect. If many (e.g., <50%) cooperate, switch to cooperating.

### Pseudocode
```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, capacity, history, n):
    if round_number <= 5:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate initially to observe behavior
    elif r - round_number <= 5:
        return 'D'  # Defect in last few rounds
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate of others
    recent_rounds = history[-10:]  # Consider past 10 rounds
    coop_count = sum(1 for actions in recent_rounds if sum(a == 'C' for a in actions) > n/2)
    coop_rate = coop_count / len(recent_rounds) if recent_rounds else 0
    
    if current_stock / capacity >= 0.7 and coop_rate > 0.7:
        return 'D'  # Exploit high stock when others cooperate
    elif current_stock / capacity < 0.5 or coop_rate < 0.5:
        return 'C'  # Preserve resource when low or many defect
    
    # Default to mirroring average action if uncertain
    total_actions = sum(1 for actions in recent_rounds for a in actions)
    defects = sum(a == 'D' for actions in recent_rounds for a in actions)
    if defects / total_actions > 0.5:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Edge Cases
- **First Round**: Cooperate to set a baseline and encourage others.
- **Last Rounds**: Defect to maximize payoff, knowing there's no future punishment.

This strategy dynamically adapts based on current stock levels and opponents' behavior, aiming to exploit while preserving resources for sustained exploitation.

1. **Initial Decision (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff by defecting when there's no history to exploit others' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds: Adaptive Play**
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players from the previous round.
   - If the average defection rate is above a threshold (e.g., 60%), switch to Cooperate in the next round.
     - Rationale: Prevent rapid stock depletion and sustain future payoffs by allowing regrowth.
   - Otherwise, continue Defecting.
     - Rationale: Exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate gains.

3. **Final Round (Last Round):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Rationale: No future rounds to consider; maximize immediate payoff without concern for stock depletion.

   - If the stock is low, prioritize Cooperation to allow regrowth and sustain payoffs in future rounds.

5. **Monitoring and Adjustment:**
   - Use a moving average of past cooperation rates to smooth strategy adjustments.
   - Adjust threshold dynamically based on observed behavior over time for better adaptability.

6. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **High Stock Levels:** Safe to Defect more frequently.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate to prevent collapse and ensure regrowth.

It aims to maximize total payoffs over multiple rounds through strategic defection and cooperation, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_300 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we consider the game's structure, parameters, and dynamics. The strategy balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability, adapting based on the current state and opponents' behaviors.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Early Rounds:** Cooperate if the stock is high to build a cooperative environment that can later be exploited.
2. **Middle Rounds:** Monitor stock trends and cooperation rates; defect when safe but cooperate if depletion risks future gains.
3. **Late Rounds:** Shift towards defecting to maximize immediate payoffs, considering remaining rounds.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate if the stock is above 90% of capacity; otherwise, defect cautiously.
- **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize final payoff.
- **Early (25% rounds):** Cooperate if stock is high (>80%) or opponents are mostly cooperating (>70%).
- **Middle (next 50%):** Defect if stock is stable/increasing; cooperate if decreasing.
- **Late (last 25%):** Defect unless stock is very low, risking regrowth.

### Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Cooperate when stock is high to encourage cooperation.
- **Last Round:** Exploit by defecting without concern for future depletion.

### Exploitative Mindset:
The strategy exploits opponents' cooperation when beneficial but avoids over-depletion to preserve future gains. It adapts dynamically, using cooperation rates and stock trends to decide actions.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, n, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C' if current_stock > 0.9 * capacity else 'D'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Early rounds: Cooperate if stock is high or opponents mostly cooperate
        if round_number <= total_rounds / 4:
            if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity:

```

### Explanation:
The strategy dynamically adjusts actions based on the game's progress and current conditions. It exploits when opponents cooperate but preserves resources to avoid future collapse, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

This approach allows for maximizing payoffs while adapting to evolving conditions, making it effective in competitive environments where cooperation and exploitation dynamics are key.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_301 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that maximizes personal payoff while considering long-term consequences, we can follow a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Behavior**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to observe others' actions and gather information.
2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: In subsequent rounds, decide whether to Cooperate or Defect based on recent cooperation levels and current stock status.
3. **Final Rounds Exploitation**: In the last few rounds, defect as much as possible to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds.

### Detailed Strategy:

#### 1. First Round:
- **Action**: Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale**: Observe others' behavior and establish a baseline for future decisions.

#### 2. Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r - 0.1r):
- **Recent Cooperation Check**:
  - Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in recent rounds (e.g., last 5% of total rounds or a fixed number like 5 rounds).
  - If more than 60% of players Cooperated recently, defect to exploit their cooperation.
  - Otherwise, cooperate to avoid over-depletion and sustain higher stock levels.

- **Stock Level Check**:
  - If the current stock is below half of the capacity (e.g., 50 when capacity=100), switch to Cooperate to preserve the resource for future rounds.

#### 3. Last Few Rounds (Last 10%):
- **Action**: Defect (D)
- **Rationale**: Maximize immediate payoff without worrying about long-term consequences since the game is ending soon.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock, history_cooperation):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Determine recent cooperation proportion
    recent_rounds = min(5, len(history_cooperation))
    recent_coop = sum(history_cooperation[-recent_rounds:]) / (n * recent_rounds)
    
    # Check stock level
    low_stock_threshold = capacity / 2
    
    if round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds * 0.1):
        return 'D'
    elif recent_coop > 0.6:
        return 'D'
    elif stock < low_stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Rationale:

- **Exploitation**: By defecting when others cooperate, the strategy takes advantage of their willingness to sustain the resource, maximizing immediate gains.
- **Preservation**: Cooperating when the stock is low ensures future rounds have a sustainable resource, balancing short-term gains with long-term viability.
- **Adaptation**: The dynamic checks for recent cooperation and stock levels allow the strategy to adapt to changing conditions and opponent behaviors.

This approach aims to maximize personal payoff while remaining robust to various opponent strategies by dynamically adjusting based on observed behavior and resource status.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_302 = '''
To address the problem, we developed a strategy that balances exploiting others' cooperation while maintaining the stock to prevent collapse. The approach adapts based on recent behavior and approaches endgame rounds greedily. Here's the organized solution:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Endgame Check**: In the final 20% of rounds, always defect to maximize immediate payoff without worrying about future consequences.

2. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - If the stock (S) is above 75% of capacity, check others' recent cooperation.
   - If S drops below 30%, switch to cooperation to help recover the stock.

3. **Recent Cooperation by Others**: Examine the last k rounds (e.g., 5 rounds) to determine if more than 50% of others' actions were cooperation. If so, defect to exploit; otherwise, cooperate.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - In the first round, defect if S is high (>75%).
   - When S exactly meets a threshold, prioritize endgame checks over other conditions.

**Answer:**

To implement this strategy effectively:

- Always defect in the final 20% of rounds.
- Monitor stock levels and recent cooperation by others to decide between exploiting or maintaining the stock.
- Switch to cooperation if the stock is critically low (below 30%) or if others are not cooperating sufficiently.

The final decision rules ensure a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on the game's progression.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{D}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_303 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (t=1):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Justification: Maximizes immediate payoff without prior history.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
   - **Step 1:** Assess Opponent Behavior
     - Count the number of players who Cooperated (C) in the previous round.
     - Calculate the cooperation rate: count_C / n.

   - **Step 2:** Determine Strategy Based on Cooperation Rate
     - If cooperation rate > threshold (e.g., 0.7):
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - Exploit cooperative players for higher immediate payoff.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - Prevent rapid resource depletion and sustain stock for future rounds.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - Continuously monitor the current stock level.
   - If stock < low_threshold (e.g., 2n):
     - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
       - Protect against further depletion to allow regrowth.

4. **Final Round (t = r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Maximize immediate payoff with no future rounds to consider.

5. **Threshold Adjustments:**
   - Start with a threshold of 0.7, meaning defect if more than 70% cooperate.
   - Dynamically adjust thresholds based on observed game dynamics and stock trends.

**Pseudocode:**

```
for each round t in 1..r:
    if t == 1:
        play D
    else:
        count_C = number of players who played C last round
        cooperation_rate = count_C / n
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        
        if cooperation_rate > 0.7 and current_stock >= low_threshold:
            play D
        elif current_stock < low_threshold:
            play C
        else:
            play C
        
    if t == r: # last round
        play D
```

This strategy balances exploiting cooperative opponents with preventing resource collapse, adapting dynamically based on opponent behavior and stock levels.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_304 = '''
The AI's strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with sustainable resource management by adapting based on other players' actions and the current state of the resource (stock). Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with cooperation in the first round to establish a baseline and avoid immediate depletion, allowing the stock to remain stable or grow.

2. **Adaptive Exploitation**:
   - For each subsequent round until the final 10% of the game:
     - Calculate the percentage of players who cooperated in the previous round.
     - If more than half (50%) of the players cooperated, defect to exploit their cooperative behavior, which likely keeps the stock high, allowing you to gain a higher payoff without severely affecting future rounds.
     - If 50% or fewer cooperated (indicating many are defecting), switch to cooperation to help preserve the stock from rapid depletion and ensure it can recover for future exploitation.

3. **Final Rounds Exploitation**: In the last 10% of rounds, always defect to maximize immediate payoffs since there's no need to preserve the resource beyond the game's end.

This strategy aims to capitalize on others' cooperative behavior when beneficial while preventing excessive resource depletion when many players are defecting, ensuring a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_305 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy in this scenario, we analyze the impact of defecting versus cooperating on the current and future stock levels. Through detailed calculations, we found that defecting when the stock level (S) is above approximately 44.4% of capacity (C) leads to a decrease in stock, while defecting below this threshold can sometimes increase it due to growth effects.

Given the lack of specific information about others' strategies or the game's duration, the safest approach for maximizing immediate gain is to always defect. This strategy prioritizes personal benefit without considering future impacts, which is optimal if the game is one-shot.

**Answer:** Defect whenever possible; that is, always choose to defect regardless of other considerations to maximize your immediate payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_306 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing individual payoff while maintaining sustainable resource levels, we can employ a balanced strategy that adapts based on both the current state of the resource and the observed behavior of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - **Reasoning:** Encourage others to also Cooperate, setting a positive precedent for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the defect rate from the previous round.
     - Let `defect_rate` = (number of players who Defected) / total number of players.
   - **Step 2:** Determine the current stock level relative to predefined thresholds.
     - Use two thresholds: a high threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) and a low threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity).
   - **Decision Criteria:**
     - If `defect_rate` < 0.4 or the current stock is above the high threshold:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - **Reasoning:** Exploit others' cooperation when they are likely to Cooperate, especially when resources are abundant.
     - Else if `defect_rate` > 0.7 or the current stock is below the low threshold:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - **Reasoning:** Preserve the resource by Cooperating when too many others are defecting or when the resource is scarce.
     - **Otherwise:**
       - Choose to Cooperate if the defect rate is moderate, balancing between exploitation and preservation.

3. **Endgame Adjustment:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds (e.g., final 10 rounds out of 100), switch to always Defecting.
     - **Reasoning:** Maximize immediate payoff with no future consequences, as the game is nearing its end.

### Example Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(previous_actions, current_stock, capacity):
    # Calculate defect rate from previous round
    total_players = len(previous_actions)
    num_defects = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
    defect_rate = num_defects / total_players

    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.6 * capacity

    # Initial round logic
    if current_stock == capacity:  # Assuming initial stock is at capacity
        return 'C'

    # Decision based on defect rate and stock level
    if (defect_rate < 0.4) or (current_stock > high_threshold):
        return 'D'
    elif (defect_rate > 0.7) or (current_stock < low_threshold):
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Moderate defect rate, balance between cooperation and defection
        return 'C' if num_defects / total_players > 0.5 else 'D'

# Example usage in a loop for each round
for t in range(1, rounds + 1):
    action = decide_action(previous_actions, current_stock, capacity)
    # Record the action and update previous_actions and current_stock accordingly
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with Cooperate helps build an environment where others might also choose to Cooperate, allowing for a more stable resource level early on.
  
- **Defect Rate Monitoring:** By tracking how many players Defected in the previous round, the strategy adapts to shifts in collective behavior. Low defect rates indicate opportunities to exploit others' cooperation, while high defect rates signal the need for preservation.

- **Stock Thresholds:** These thresholds ensure that exploitation (Defecting) is only pursued when resources are abundant, and preservation (Cooperating) is prioritized when resources are scarce or under threat of depletion.

- **Endgame Adjustment:** Near the conclusion of the game, defecting maximizes immediate gains since there's no need to preserve resources for future rounds that don't exist.

This strategy balances short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior and resource levels.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_307 = '''
To address the problem of exploiting others while maintaining a sustainable resource level, we propose a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy is based on observing the current stock level and dynamically adjusting actions (defect or cooperate) to maximize payoffs without causing an unsustainable crash.

### Approach
The strategy involves three main tiers based on the current stock level as a percentage of capacity:

1. **High Stock (Above 80% Capacity):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Exploit the high stock by defecting to maximize immediate payoff without significant risk of crashing the resource.

2. **Moderate Stock (Between 40% and 80% Capacity):**
   - **Action:** Observe opponents' recent actions. If more than 50% have been Cooperating, Defect; else, Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Exploit when others are cooperative but switch to cooperation if many are defecting to prevent a crash.

3. **Low Stock (Below 40% Capacity):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Allow the stock to recover by cooperating, ensuring sustainable exploitation in future rounds.

This approach dynamically adjusts based on both the current resource level and opponents' behaviors, aiming to maximize immediate gains while maintaining long-term sustainability.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(stock_level, capacity, opponent_actions):
    cooperation_rate = sum(1 for a in opponent_actions if a == 'cooperate') / len(opponent_actions) if opponent_actions else 0.5
    
    if stock_level > 0.8 * capacity:
        return 'defect'
    elif 0.4 * capacity <= stock_level <= 0.8 * capacity:
        if cooperation_rate > 0.5:
            return 'defect'
        else:
            return 'cooperate'
    else:  # stock level below 40%
        return 'cooperate'
```

### Explanation
- **High Stock (Above 80% Capacity):** By defecting, we exploit the abundance of resources without immediate risk of depletion.
- **Moderate Stock (Between 40% and 80% Capacity):** We observe opponents' actions. If they cooperate more than defect, exploiting by defecting yields higher payoffs. Otherwise, cooperating prevents a crash.
- **Low Stock (Below 40% Capacity):** Cooperating helps the stock recover, ensuring that future exploitation is possible without causing an unsustainable crash.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to different conditions and opponents' behaviors to optimize outcomes.

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff by exploiting cooperative tendencies of other players while maintaining a sustainable resource level.

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Few Rounds):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to observe others' behavior.
   - Continue cooperating until significant defects or stock depletion is observed.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation:**
   - Track stock levels, consumption patterns, and opponents' actions over rounds.
   - Adjust strategy based on observed trends towards cooperation or defection.

3. **Defection Thresholds:**
   - Calculate potential payoffs for Cooperate (C) and Defect (D).
   - Consider future stock growth after each action to determine if defecting is sustainable.
   - Only defect when the immediate gain outweighs the risk of depleting the resource below a critical threshold.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Increase defection in later rounds as impacts on future payoffs diminish.
   - Adapt based on historical consumption and stock trends, balancing exploitation with resource sustainability.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish baseline behavior observation.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = maximum_stock_level
    r = total_rounds

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to observe others

    # Calculate potential payoffs for C and D
    payoff_C = stock_level / (2 * n)
    payoff_D = stock_level / n

    # Estimate future stock after each action based on history
    if payoff_D > payoff_C:
        # Check if defecting is sustainable
        if can_defect_safely(stock_level, history):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    else:
        return 'C'

def can_defect_safely(current_stock, history):
    # Calculate expected stock after consumption and growth
    # ... (detailed calculations based on historical data)
    future_stock = calculate_future_stock(current_stock, history)

    # Define a threshold for safe defection
    if future_stock > 0.5 * capacity:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

---

### **Summary:**

- The strategy begins with cooperation to gather information on opponents.
- It dynamically adjusts based on observed behavior and stock trends, defecting when beneficial without causing irreversible resource depletion.
- Safeguards ensure that defection only occurs when sustainable, maximizing long-term gains while exploiting cooperative tendencies.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_309 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1 to r/2):**
   - Begin with a neutral stance, observing opponents' actions without immediate exploitation.
   - Cooperate in the first few rounds to encourage others to do the same, setting a baseline for future moves.

2. **Decision-Making Process:**
   - Track the stock level and past consumption patterns to determine if other players are defecting excessively or maintaining cooperation.
   - Use a threshold-based approach where switching from C to D occurs when the current stock falls below 60% of capacity, indicating potential over-consumption.

3. **Adaptive Behavior:**
   - If opponents show a tendency towards frequent defection, adjust strategy to defect more often to exploit remaining resources.
   - Remember past actions and their effects on stock replenishment to inform future decisions, enhancing adaptability.

4. **Later Rounds (Rounds r/2 to r):**
   - Shift focus to maximizing immediate payoffs by increasing the frequency of defection as rounds progress towards the end.
   - Exploit the resource without concern for long-term sustainability, focusing on short-term gains.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - In the first round, cooperate cautiously while monitoring others' moves.
   - In the last few rounds, defect to exploit whatever remains of the stock, maximizing personal payoff regardless of future impact.

6. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Continuously adjust strategies based on opponents' behavior and resource levels, ensuring responsiveness to changing game dynamics.
   - Use memory of past actions to anticipate and counteract potential moves by others, maintaining a competitive edge.

This strategy balances initial observation with strategic exploitation, adapting dynamically to maximize personal payoff while considering the impact of others' actions.
'''

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we designed an exploitative strategy that adapts based on opponents' behaviors and current stock levels while ensuring sustainability. Here's the detailed strategy:

### Strategy Overview

The strategy balances short-term exploitation with long-term resource sustainability by adjusting actions based on opponents' past behavior and current stock levels.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to set a cooperative baseline and observe others' actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - If the current stock is below a predefined threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), cooperate to allow resource recovery.
   - Otherwise, if in the previous round more than half of the players defected, defect to exploit their actions.
   - Else, continue cooperating.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Always defect since there are no future consequences for depleting the resource.

### Threshold Consideration

The stock threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity) is chosen to ensure that if cooperation resumes, the resource can recover without severe depletion. This threshold may vary based on game parameters but should be low enough to trigger conservation when necessary.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, prev_round_actions, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    
    # Initial Round (Round 1)
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Last Round (Round r)
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    # Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)
    # Check if stock is below the threshold
    if current_stock < capacity * 0.3:  # Threshold set at 30%
        return 'C'
    
    # Determine majority action in the previous round
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in prev_round_actions.values() if action == 'D')
    majority_defect = num_defectors > n / 2
    
    if majority_defect:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by cooperating to encourage others and observe their strategies.
- **Adaptive Exploitation:** Monitors the previous round's actions. If more than half defect, it defects in the next round to exploit higher immediate payoffs.
- **Sustainability Check:** Switches to cooperation if the stock falls below a critical threshold to prevent resource collapse and enable recovery.
- **Terminal Defection:** Ensures maximum payoff in the last round without concern for future rounds.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to opponents' behaviors while maintaining a cautious approach to resource management.

**Objective:**  
To maximize individual payoffs through adaptive exploitation of opponents' behaviors while maintaining a balance to prevent resource depletion.

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate (C) vs Defect (D)**

#### **Early Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative baseline and observe opponents' behaviors, allowing the strategy to gather information for future exploitation.

#### **Middle Rounds: Exploitation Phase**
- **Monitor Opponents' Behavior:** Track the proportion of opponents who Defected in the last round.
  - If defection rate < 40%:
    - **Action:** Defect (D)
    - **Rationale:** Exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate payoffs.
  - If defection rate ≥ 60%:
    - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
    - **Rationale:** Prevent rapid resource depletion and encourage sustainable stock levels.

#### **Sustainability Check:**
- **Current Stock Level:** If the stock falls below 30% of capacity:
  - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - **Rationale:** Preserve and allow stock recovery through growth, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.

#### **Endgame Phase (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
- **Action:** Defect (D)
- **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds.

---

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**

#### **First Round:**
- Always Cooperate to build a cooperative history and observe opponents.

#### **Last Few Rounds:**
- Switch to Defect regardless of others' actions to exploit any remaining cooperation and maximize final payoffs.

#### **Stock Depletion:**
- If stock is critically low (e.g., below 30% of capacity), prioritize Cooperating to facilitate recovery, ensuring long-term exploitation potential.

### **3. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, opponent_actions_history, current_stock):
    n = number_of_players()
    threshold_defect_rate = 0.4  # 40% defection rate
    low_stock_threshold = capacity * 0.3  # 30% of capacity

        elif current_stock < low_stock_threshold:
            return 'C'

        elif recent_defect_rate < threshold_defect_rate:

        else:
            return 'C'  # Maintain sustainability

    return 'C'
```

---

### **4. Strategy Rationale**

- **Adaptability:** The strategy adapts dynamically based on opponents' behavior and the current stock level, ensuring exploitation opportunities while preventing resource collapse.
- **Exploitation Focus:** By defecting when others cooperate and cooperating when others defect heavily, the strategy maximizes immediate payoffs while maintaining long-term sustainability.
- **Sustainability Checks:** Ensures that cooperation is prioritized when necessary to prevent stock depletion, allowing for continued exploitation in future rounds.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, exploiting opponents effectively while adapting to changing game conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_312 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initialization**: Begin with a defection (D) in the first round to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Decision Rules Based on Stock Level**:
   - **High Stock (>75% of Capacity)**: Defect, as the resource can sustain consumption and regrow.
   - **Low Stock (<25% of Capacity)**: Cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow recovery.
   - **Mid-Range Stock (25%-75%)**: Adjust based on opponent behavior:
     - Calculate the opponent defection rate over recent rounds.
     - If the defection rate exceeds 60%, defect; otherwise, cooperate.

3. **Adaptation for Late Rounds**:
   - In the final 25% of total rounds, increase the tendency to defect to exploit without concern for future depletion.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Always defect.
   - **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

This strategy balances exploitation with conservation, adapting to opponent behavior and game progression to optimize payoffs while preventing resource collapse.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_313 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a dynamic strategy that balances exploitation with resource sustainability. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

### Step 1: Initial Cooperation
- **Action**: Cooperate in the first round(s).
- **Purpose**: Establishes a baseline and encourages others to cooperate, fostering a stable environment for future exploitation.

### Step 2: Observation Phase
- **Action**: Track other players' actions (cooperate/defect) each round.
- **Purpose**: Gathers data on others' strategies to inform subsequent decisions.

### Step 3: Adaptive Exploitation
- **Condition**: If more than 70% of other players are cooperating and the stock is above 60% of capacity:
  - **Action**: Defect.
  - **Purpose**: Exploit others' cooperation for higher payoffs while maintaining a sustainable resource level.
- **Else**:
  - **Action**: Cooperate.
  - **Purpose**: Contributes to resource conservation, preventing premature depletion.

### Step 4: Stock Threshold Management
- **Condition**: If the stock drops below 30% of capacity:
  - **Action**: Switch to cooperate for at least one round.
  - **Purpose**: Allows the stock to recover, ensuring future exploitation is sustainable.

### Step 5: Endgame Strategy
- **Condition**: In the last 5% of rounds (e.g., final k rounds where k = 0.05 * total rounds):
  - **Action**: Always defect.
  - **Purpose**: Maximizes immediate payoffs without concern for future depletions, as there are no remaining rounds.

### Step 6: Dynamic Adjustment
- **Process**: Continuously monitor and adjust thresholds (e.g., cooperation percentage, stock levels) based on empirical results or simulations.
- **Purpose**: Optimizes the strategy in real-time, enhancing effectiveness against varying player behaviors.

### Final Answer

To implement this solution effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to encourage others to maintain a stable resource level.
2. **Observation and Tracking**: Monitor other players' actions each round to gauge cooperation levels.
3. **Adaptive Exploitation**:
   - Defect if over 70% of others are cooperating and stock is above 60% capacity.
   - Cooperate otherwise to aid in resource sustainability.
4. **Stock Management**: Switch to cooperation if the stock drops below 30% to allow recovery.
5. **Endgame Exploitation**: Always defect in the final 5% of rounds to maximize immediate gains.

This strategy dynamically balances exploitation with conservation, ensuring sustainable payoffs while adapting to others' behaviors and resource conditions.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to initially cooperate, adaptively exploit when safe, manage stock thresholds, and maximize endgame payoffs. This ensures sustainable exploitation and maximizes overall gain. The final answer is encapsulated in the dynamic strategy outlined above, which can be succinctly represented as:

$\boxed{\text{Adaptive Exploitation with Conservation}}$

description_EXPLOITATIVE_314 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize personal payoff by strategically defecting and cooperating based on current game state and history.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Exploitation (Early Rounds):**
   - In the first half of the game, prioritize **Defecting (D)** to exploit others' potential cooperation, maximizing immediate gains.

2. **Stock Monitoring and Adaptation:**
   - After each round, calculate the stock change percentage relative to its previous state.
     - If the stock increases significantly (>5%), lower the threshold slightly to encourage continued defecting.
     - If the stock decreases notably (<-10%), raise the threshold to promote cooperation and resource preservation.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Start with a base threshold of 70% (capacity * 0.7).
   - Adjust this threshold dynamically based on observed stock trends:
     - Increase if stock depletes significantly.
     - Decrease if stock remains stable or grows.

4. **Mid-Game Adaptation:**
   - If the current stock exceeds the adjusted threshold, continue defecting to exploit others' cooperation.
   - If below the threshold, switch to cooperating (C) to allow resource regrowth for future exploitation.

5. **Late-Stage Exploitation (Final Rounds):**
   - In the last 20% of total rounds, prioritize defecting regardless of the stock level to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for long-term sustainability.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always defect to test others' initial strategies and potentially gain higher payoff.

2. **Low Stock Levels:**
   - If the stock is critically low, prioritize cooperation to prevent further depletion and enable potential future exploitation.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final rounds, defect aggressively to capitalize on any remaining resource without regard for future consequences.

### **Summary:**

This strategy balances short-term exploitation with long-term resource preservation. By dynamically adjusting cooperation based on observed trends, it maximizes payoffs while adapting to other players' behaviors and game conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_315 = '''
To determine whether to Cooperate or Defect in a given round, consider the following structured approach:

1. **Initial Exploration Phase (First 5 rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate
   - **Reasoning**: Gather data on opponents' behavior and assess their tendencies.

2. **Opponent Analysis**:
   - Calculate each opponent's cooperation rate over recent rounds.
   - Identify trends in their behavior.

3. **Stock Assessment**:
   - Compare current stock level to predefined thresholds (High, Moderate, Low).
   - Estimate potential recovery based on growth rates.

4. **Decision Tree**:

   a. If in Initial Exploration Phase:
      - Cooperate.

   b. Else if Stock is High (>70% of capacity):
      i. If >60% of opponents are Cooperating:
         - Defect to exploit the situation.
      ii. Else:
         - Cooperate to encourage others to Cooperate.

   c. Else if Stock is Moderate (40%-70%):
      i. If >70% of opponents are Cooperating:
         - Defect cautiously, considering long-term impacts.
      ii. Else:
         - Cooperate to support recovery.

   d. Else if Stock is Low (<40%):
      i. Always Cooperate to prevent further depletion.

5. **Final Rounds Adjustment (Last 20%)**:
   - Prioritize defecting when possible, but consider stock levels to avoid crashes.

6. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Update data and reassess after each round.
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on outcomes.

**Answer**: To determine the action for this round, first assess opponents' cooperation rates and current stock level. If most opponents are Cooperating and the stock is sufficiently high, consider Defecting to exploit the situation while ensuring long-term sustainability. Otherwise, Cooperate to encourage mutual resource preservation.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate or Defect based on opponents' behavior and stock level}}$

description_EXPLOITATIVE_316 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** When the current stock is low, and a significant number of players are defecting. This helps in preserving the resource for future rounds where higher payoffs might be possible.
   - **Defect (D):** In most other scenarios, especially when the majority of players are cooperating or when it's the last round.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always defect to test others' responses and gain a higher immediate payoff.
   - **Last Round (Round r):** Definitely defect as there are no future rounds to consider, maximizing immediate gains without worrying about resource depletion.

3. **Adaptive Behavior:**
   - Monitor the number of cooperators and defectors in each round. If most players are defecting, continue to defect to exploit their strategy.
   - When stock levels are low, shift towards cooperation to aid in stock recovery, ensuring sustainable exploitation in future rounds.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()

    if round_number == 1:
        # Exploit by defecting first round to test others
        return 'D'
    elif round_number == r:
        # Last round: defect for maximum payoff
        return 'D'
    else:
        cooperators = count_cooperators(history)
        defectors = n - cooperators

        if stock_level < threshold:
            # Cooperate to help regrow the resource
            return 'C'
        elif defectors > 0.5 * n:
            # If more than half are defecting, defect too
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Exploit cooperation by defecting
            return 'D'

def threshold(stock_level):
    # Determine if stock is low based on some proportion of capacity
    # Example: 30% of capacity
    return stock_level < (capacity * 0.3)
```

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting to the behavior of other players and the current state of the common pool resource.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_317 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to observe others' actions without significantly affecting the stock.
   - **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1):**
     - Count the number of Cooperators in the previous round (`C_prev`).
     - Calculate cooperation rate: `C_rate = C_prev / n`.
     - If `C_rate > threshold` (e.g., 0.6), defect to exploit others' cooperation.
     - Else, check current stock (`S`):
       - If `S > 0.5 * capacity`, defect.
       - Else, cooperate to allow stock recovery.
   - **Last Round (r):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to Cooperating if stock is below 50% of capacity to preserve growth potential for future rounds.

3. **Exploitative Mindset:**
   - Exploit others when they cooperate by defecting, maximizing immediate gain.
   - Preserve the resource when necessary to ensure sustainable exploitation in future rounds.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python

            else:
                action = 'C'
    record_action(action)

This strategy balances exploitation with resource preservation, adapting to opponents' behavior and the game's state to maximize long-term payoffs.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round**: 
   - Cooperate (C) to observe opponents' behavior and maintain a stable stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the number of players who Cooperated in the previous round (`prev_coop`).
   - If `prev_coop > 0.6 * n` (more than 60% of players Cooperated) and current stock > 40% of capacity:
     - Defect (D) to exploit others' cooperation.
   - Else if in the final few rounds (last 2-3):
     - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without worrying about future rounds.
   - Else:
     - Cooperate (C).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to encourage others and maintain a healthy stock level.
   - **Low Stock**: If the current stock drops below 40% of capacity, switch to Cooperating to allow the resource to recover.
   - **Final Rounds**: Defect (D) in the last few rounds to maximize immediate gain.

**Rationale**:
- The strategy balances exploitation with sustainability. By defecting when a majority Cooperate and the stock is sufficient, it maximizes immediate gains while preserving the resource for future exploitation opportunities. In critical situations like low stock or final rounds, cooperation or defecting ensures resource health and maximum payoff respectively.

**Implementation in Pseudocode**:

```python
def decide_action(prev_coop, current_stock, round_number):
    capacity = get_capacity()
    n_players = get_number_of_players()

This strategy aims to exploit cooperative behavior when advantageous while maintaining resource sustainability to prevent complete depletion, ensuring long-term gain and adaptability.

To address the problem, we designed an adaptive and exploitative strategy for the game, balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a structured summary of the approach:

1. **Initial Phase**:

   - **Trend Analysis**: For other cases, consider the trend over the last few rounds. If cooperation is increasing, defect; otherwise, cooperate.

3. **Final Phase**:
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10%)**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoffs since there's no future benefit in preserving the stock.

**Exploitative Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation**

1. **Initialization**:
   - In the first round, Cooperate to observe other players' initial actions and gauge the environment.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   a. Calculate the average number of Cooperators in the last k rounds (k=3 or similar).
   b. If this average is above a threshold (e.g., more than half of n), then Defect to exploit their cooperation and gain higher immediate payoff.
   c. Else, Cooperate to encourage others to continue defecting, preserving resources for future exploitation.

3. **Last Round**:
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact beyond this round.

4. **Stock Level Consideration**:
   a. If current stock is above 75% of capacity, prioritize exploiting cooperation by defecting.
   b. If stock is below 25%, prioritize Cooperating to preserve the resource for potential future gains.
   c. For moderate stock levels (25-75%), base decision on recent player behavior as per points a and b.

This strategy adaptively balances exploitation of cooperative players with preservation of resources when necessary, aiming to maximize individual payoff over multiple rounds by leveraging observed behaviors and stock dynamics.

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_322 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we can outline a strategic approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observed player behavior and current stock levels. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Step 1: Initial Cooperation
- **Action:** Cooperate in the first few rounds.
- **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation helps build a pattern where other players may also choose to cooperate, maintaining or increasing the stock level.

### Step 2: Monitor and Adjust Based on Previous Round's Behavior
- **Action:** Observe the number of cooperators in the previous round.
- **Rationale:** If more than half of the players (including yourself) cooperated last round, it indicates a willingness to sustain the stock, making defection this round potentially advantageous.

### Step 3: Check Stock Threshold
- **Action:** Ensure the current stock level is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
- **Rationale:** A sufficiently high stock ensures that even with increased consumption from defection, growth can sustain or replenish the stock adequately.

### Step 4: Defect if Conditions are Met
- **Action:** If both conditions (more than half cooperated last round and stock above threshold) are satisfied, defect.
- **Rationale:** Exploit the cooperative behavior of others while ensuring the stock remains sustainable for future rounds.

### Step 5: Cooperate Otherwise
- **Action:** If either condition isn't met, cooperate.
- **Rationale:** Prevents over-depletion of the stock when cooperation from others is insufficient or when the stock is too low to sustain consumption levels.

### Step 6: Defect in Late Rounds
- **Action:** In the final few rounds, defect regardless of previous conditions.
- **Rationale:** Maximizes immediate payoff since future rounds are limited or nonexistent.

### Final Strategy

**1. First Round(s):**
   - Cooperate to encourage others to do the same and maintain a healthy stock level.

**2. Middle Rounds:**
   - If in the previous round, more than half of the players (including yourself) cooperated:
     - And if the current stock is above 75% of capacity:
       - Defect this round.
   - Else:
     - Cooperate to help sustain the stock for future exploitation.

**3. Last Round(s):**
   - Regardless of other conditions, defect to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are limited or nonexistent.

This approach strategically balances cooperation and defection, ensuring long-term sustainability while maximizing personal gains in later stages.

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize payoffs by exploiting opponents' behavior while maintaining a balance to ensure sustainable exploitation. It adapts based on current stock levels, recent opponent actions, and the number of rounds remaining.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**

- **Initial Rounds (First Round):** Always Cooperate to encourage others to also Cooperate, keeping the stock high for potential future exploitation.
  
- **Endgame (Last Few Rounds):** Switch to always Defecting to maximize immediate gains without concern for depleting the stock since there are no future rounds left.

- **Mid Game:**
  - If the proportion of recent Cooperates from other players exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60% in the last 5 rounds), defect to exploit their Cooperation and gain higher payoffs.
  - If below this threshold, Cooperate to mitigate stock depletion and encourage others to also Cooperate.

- **Stock Considerations:**
  - If current stock is below a low threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), always Cooperate to allow for recovery through growth.
  - If above this threshold, follow the mid-game rules based on recent opponent behavior.

    # Parameters
    m = 3          # Number of endgame rounds to exploit

### **3. Explanation of Components**

- **Initial Round:** Cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and keep the stock high.
  
- **Endgame Exploitation:** In the last few rounds, defect to maximize immediate gains without worrying about future consequences.

- **Recent Behavior Analysis:** By monitoring recent actions (last k rounds), the strategy adapts to exploit when others are Cooperating and conserve when they are defecting.

- **Stock Thresholds:** Maintaining a low stock threshold ensures that if the stock drops too much, the strategy switches to preserving it, allowing for recovery through growth.

---

### **4. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Always Defect regardless of other factors.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to Cooperating to prevent further depletion and encourage recovery.

This strategy balances exploitation with preservation, adapting dynamically to opponents' behavior while ensuring sustainable gains over the game.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate of opponents from previous rounds.
   - If the stock is above a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity):
     - Cooperate if most opponents have cooperated in recent rounds.
     - Defect otherwise, exploiting cooperative opponents.
   - If the stock is below the threshold:

3. **Last Few Rounds (Rounds r-10% to r):**
   - **Action:** Defect

4. **Adaptation and Reputation:**
   - If opponents retaliate by defecting, switch to cooperate to help restore the stock.
   - Balance between short-term gains and maintaining a sustainable resource.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

for each round in 1..r:
    if round == 1:
        action = D

- **Last Rounds:** Focus on immediate exploitation without regard for future rounds.
- **Stock Levels:** Adjust strategy based on stock health to balance exploitation and sustainability.

This strategy adapts dynamically, exploiting cooperative behaviors while managing resource depletion to sustain long-term gains.

### **Decision Rules: When to Cooperate (C) vs Defect (D)**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **Round 1:** Cooperate to observe others' initial moves and set a baseline for future decisions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t = 2 to r-1):**
   - **Current Stock Thresholds:**
     - If stock is above 75% of capacity:
       - Tend towards Defecting, especially if many opponents are defecting.
     - If stock is below 50% of capacity:
       - Cooperate to prevent rapid depletion and allow growth.
   - **Opponent Behavior:**
     - Track players' past actions. Target those who cooperate frequently by defecting against them when safe.

3. **Last Round (t = r):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future rounds to suffer from resource depletion.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Adjust thresholds based on observed play patterns and stock dynamics.
   - If the stock is mid-range (50%-75%), balance between defecting for higher payoffs and cooperating to ensure sustainable growth.

---

### **Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to gather initial information about opponents' strategies.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect to capitalize on immediate gains without concern for future rounds.
- **Low Stock Levels (<25% capacity):** Cooperate consistently to allow significant growth and prevent stock crash.

---

### **Exploitation Strategy**

1. **Targeted Exploitation:**
   - Identify players who cooperate frequently and defect against them when the stock is high enough to sustain their cooperation.

2. **Sustainability Consideration:**
   - Avoid over-defecting in rounds where the stock is already low, as this could lead to rapid depletion and lower payoffs in future rounds.

3. **Adaptive Thresholds:**
   - Use logistic growth dynamics to estimate how much the stock will recover after each round.
   - Adjust defecting tendency based on predicted recovery rates and opponents' behavior patterns.

### **Summary of Strategy**

- **Exploitation:** Target frequent cooperators when the stock is high, defecting to gain higher payoffs.
- **Sustainability:** Cooperate when the stock is low to prevent rapid depletion and allow recovery.
- **Adaptation:** Adjust decisions dynamically based on stock levels, opponent behavior, and game progress.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, exploiting opponents effectively while managing resource dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_326 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing your payoff while balancing resource exploitation and preservation in a game with other players, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both opponents' behavior and current resource levels. Here's how it works:

### Step 1: Initial Round Strategy
- **Action**: Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale**: Start by building a cooperative base to avoid early depletion of resources.

### Step 2: Subsequent Rounds Strategy (Rounds 2 to r-1)

#### A. Determine Current State
- **State Modes**:
  - **Exploit Mode**: When resource levels are sufficient to allow exploitation without risking collapse.
  - **Preserve Mode**: When resources are low, necessitating conservation.

#### B. Exploit Mode Strategy
- **Conditions**:
  - Resource level (S) > 70% of capacity (X=0.7).
  - Opponents' average defect rate (avg_D) over recent rounds < threshold T (initially T=0.3).

- **Action**: Defect (D)
- **Rationale**: Exploit cooperative opponents while resources are abundant.

#### C. Preserve Mode Strategy
- **Conditions**:
  - Resource level (S) < 30% of capacity (Y=0.3).

- **Action**: Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale**: Conserve resources to prevent collapse and allow recovery.

#### D. Transition Between Modes
- **Switch to Preserve Mode**: When S drops below 30%.
- **Return to Exploit Mode**: Once S recovers above 50% (Z=0.5).

### Step 3: Dynamic Threshold Adjustment
- **Adapt T Based on Outcomes**:
  - If defecting leads to stable or increasing resource levels, keep T same or slightly decrease it.
  - If defecting causes significant depletion, increase T to encourage more cooperation in future rounds.

### Step 4: Last Round Strategy (Round r)
- **Action**: Defect (D)
- **Rationale**: Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Step 5: Edge Cases and Considerations
- **Stock Dynamics**: Monitor resource levels to prevent collapse, especially when approaching critical thresholds.
- **Opponents' Behavior**: Use a moving average of recent defect rates weighted towards more recent data to adapt quickly to changes.
- **Threshold Caps**: Ensure T does not become too high (cap at 1.0) to maintain the ability to exploit when possible.

### Summary
This strategy balances exploitation and preservation by adapting to current resource levels and opponents' behavior. It switches between modes based on predefined thresholds, dynamically adjusts these thresholds, and ensures long-term sustainability while maximizing immediate gains in the final round.

The AI player will adopt a strategic approach that balances immediate exploitation with sustainable management of the resource. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Threshold Setting**: The AI sets an initial threshold T at half of the capacity (T = capacity / 2). This serves as a reference point to decide between Cooperate and Defect actions.

2. **Decision Making in Each Round**:
    - If the current stock level S is below the threshold T, the AI will Cooperate. This action helps preserve the resource, allowing it to recover through growth for future exploitation.
    - If the current stock level S is above the threshold T, the AI will Defect. This maximizes immediate payoff by taking as much of the resource as possible while ensuring there's enough left for sustainable recovery.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: After each round, the AI evaluates the impact of its actions on the stock:
    - If defecting caused a significant drop in the stock (S dropped below capacity/2), the AI lowers T to encourage more Cooperate actions in subsequent rounds.
    - If defecting didn't deplete the stock excessively, the AI may keep or slightly increase T to allow for more Defects in future rounds.

4. **Adaptation Based on Opponents' Behavior**: While not explicitly modeling opponents' strategies, the dynamic adjustment of T implicitly adapts to changes in total consumption based on others' actions. If many players are defecting, leading to faster depletion, the AI's threshold will adjust to encourage more Cooperate actions.

This strategy ensures that the AI maximizes its immediate payoff while maintaining a sustainable resource level for continued exploitation throughout the rounds.

**Answer:**

The AI will Cooperate when the current stock is below half of the capacity and Defect otherwise. It dynamically adjusts this threshold based on observed outcomes to balance exploitation and sustainability.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S < \frac{\text{capacity}}{2}, \text{ else Defect, adjusting threshold adaptively}}

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Few Rounds):**
   - Begin by cooperating in the first 2-3 rounds to observe opponents' strategies without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Behavior Analysis:**
   - Track each opponent's actions over time, noting patterns such as tendencies towards cooperation or defection.
   - Use a moving average of recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds) to assess current trends in others' behavior.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds and Decision Rules:**
   - **High Stock Scenario:** If the stock is above 75% of capacity and more than half of other players are defecting, switch to defecting.
   - **Low Stock Scenario:** If the stock drops below 25%, revert to cooperation to allow recovery.

4. **Exploitation of Cooperators:**
   - When others cooperate, defect to gain higher payoffs, ensuring this doesn't cause an unsustainable drop in stock levels.

5. **Adaptation and Randomness:**
   - Continuously adjust strategy based on recent actions and stock levels.
   - Incorporate probabilistic elements; sometimes defect even if conditions don't strictly meet thresholds to prevent predictability.

6. **Endgame Strategy (Last Few Rounds):**
   - In the last 2-3 rounds, consider defecting more aggressively as there's no future beyond these rounds, exploiting any remaining cooperation.

7. **Cooldown Period:**
   - After switching strategies, avoid oscillation by maintaining a strategy for at least 1-2 rounds before reassessing.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def exploitative_strategy(round_number, stock_level, opponent_actions):
    if round_number <= initial_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    recent_defectors = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions[-recent_window:] if action == 'D')
    proportion_defecting = recent_defectors / len(opponent_actions)
    
    if stock_level > high_threshold and proportion_defecting > 0.5:
        return 'D'
    elif stock_level < low_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Exploit cooperators with some probability
        exploit_prob = max(0.2, min(0.8, (stock_level / capacity) * 0.6 + 0.2))
        if random.random() < exploit_prob and any(action == 'C' for action in opponent_actions):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

# Parameters
initial_rounds = 3
recent_window = 5
high_threshold = capacity * 0.75
low_threshold = capacity * 0.25
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with resource management, exploiting others while preventing rapid depletion. It adapts dynamically to changing conditions and opponent behaviors, aiming to maximize personal payoffs over the game rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_329 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by monitoring stock levels and inferring others' behaviors. The solution involves a dynamic decision-making process tailored to different stages of the game.

### Approach

1. **Initial Exploration**: Begin by defecting in the first round to assess other players' actions and their impact on the stock.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision-Making**:
   - Use predefined high and low thresholds relative to the capacity to guide decisions between defecting and cooperating.
3. **Behavioral Inference**: Estimate the number of defectors from previous rounds using total consumption data, informing subsequent choices.
4. **Adaptive Strategy**:
   - Defect when the stock is above the high threshold and many players are exploiting.
   - Cooperate when the stock is below the low threshold to aid recovery.
   - Adjust decisions based on inferred behavior in intermediate stock levels.
5. **Endgame Exploitation**: Switch to always defecting in the final rounds to maximize immediate gains without concern for future impacts.

### Solution Code

```python
def determine_action(current_stock, capacity, total_consumption_prev_round, num_players, round_number, total_rounds):
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    endgame_rounds = max(1, int(total_rounds * 0.1))  # Defect in last 10% of rounds

    if round_number <= 2:
        return 'D'  # Start with D to test others' behavior
    
    if total_consumption_prev_round == 0:
        k_prev = num_players  # All cooperated
    else:
        s_prev = current_stock + (total_consumption_prev_round - (current_stock * (1 - (2 / (capacity + current_stock))))) 
        k_prev = (2 * num_players * total_consumption_prev_round) / s_prev - num_players
    
    if round_number > total_rounds - endgame_rounds:
        return 'D'  # Defect in the final rounds regardless of other factors
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        return 'D'
    elif current_stock < low_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if k_prev > num_players / 2:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

# Example usage:
num_players = 4
total_rounds = 100

for round_number in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    current_stock = get_current_stock(round_number)  # Assume this function exists
    if round_number == 1:
        action = 'D'
    else:
        total_consumption_prev_round = get_total_consumption_previous_round()  # Assume this function exists
        action = determine_action(current_stock, capacity, total_consumption_prev_round, num_players, round_number, total_rounds)
    
    perform_action(action)  # Assume this function exists to execute the chosen action
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Exploration**: The strategy begins by defecting in the first two rounds to observe others' actions and their impact on the stock.
- **Threshold-Based Decision-Making**: High (80% of capacity) and low (30%) thresholds guide whether to defect or cooperate, ensuring a balance between exploitation and preservation.
- **Behavioral Inference**: By estimating the number of defectors from previous rounds, the strategy adapts to others' behaviors, enhancing decision-making in intermediate stock levels.
- **Adaptive Strategy**: The approach dynamically adjusts based on current stock levels and inferred behavior, defecting when others exploit and cooperating when necessary for recovery.
- **Endgame Exploitation**: Switching to always defecting in the final 10% of rounds maximizes immediate gains, capitalizing on the absence of future consequences.

This comprehensive strategy ensures a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to evolving game conditions.

**Final Answer**

To maximize your payoff, adopt a dynamic strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on the current stock level and recent opponent behavior:

1. **Early Rounds:** Cooperate when the stock is above 70% of capacity and opponents have been defecting less than 30% of the time in recent rounds.

2. **Mid-Game:** Gradually lower the stock threshold for cooperation to 60% and increase the acceptable defect rate among opponents to 40%.

3. **Late Rounds:** Cooperate only if the stock exceeds 50% and opponents have been defecting less than 50%. In the final round, always Defect.

4. **Adaptation:** Adjust your cooperation threshold and acceptable defect rates dynamically as the game progresses towards its end to exploit opportunities when possible while preserving the resource.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Assess Current Round (t):**
   - If it's the last round (t = r), choose to Defect for maximum payoff.
   - For other rounds, continue to step 2.

2. **Calculate Thresholds:**
   - Compute the cooperation stock threshold as a decreasing function from 70% in early rounds to 50% by the end.
   - Determine the acceptable defect rate among opponents as an increasing function from 30% to 50%.

3. **Evaluate Opponent Behavior:**
   - Track the proportion of Defect actions by opponents in recent rounds (e.g., last 5).
   - If this proportion is below the current acceptable defect rate, proceed to step 4.

4. **Check Stock Level:**
   - If the current stock exceeds the cooperation threshold and opponents are mostly cooperating, choose to Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, choose to Defect.

**Implementation Example:**

- For round t with total rounds r:
  - Cooperation_S_threshold = max(70% - (t/r)*20%, 50%)
  - Defects_allowed = min(30% + (t/r)*20%, 50%)

- Track opponents' defect rate in the last k rounds.
- Cooperate if stock > threshold and defects < allowed; else, Defect.

**Final Answer:**

Adopt a strategy that starts with cooperation when the stock is high and others are mostly cooperating. Gradually shift to defection as the game progresses, especially if opponents start defecting more or the stock decreases significantly. Always defect in the final round for maximum payoff.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; dynamically switch to Defect based on stock and opponent behavior}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_331 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we'll outline a strategy that balances exploitation with conservation based on the current stock level.

### Strategy Outline:
1. **Defect When Stock is High:** Exploit the resource by defecting whenever the current stock exceeds half of its capacity (C/2). This maximizes short-term gains.
2. **Cooperate When Stock is Low:** Switch to cooperating once the stock drops below C/2 to prevent further depletion and allow the resource to recover.

### Rationale:
- **Exploitation Phase (Stock > C/2):** By defecting, you gain more in each round compared to cooperation, which helps maximize your payoff while the resource is abundant.
- **Conservation Phase (Stock ≤ C/2):** Cooperating when the stock is low ensures that the resource isn't over-depleted, allowing it to recover for future exploitation.

### Example Walkthrough:
Consider a scenario with 4 players and a capacity of 100 units. The strategy in action:

- **Round 1:** Stock = 100 > 50 → Defect.
  - Total consumption increases, stock drops but remains above the threshold.
  
- **Round 2:** Stock decreases but stays above 50 → Continue defecting.
  
- ... (Subsequent rounds where stock remains above 50)
  
- **Round N:** Stock drops below 50 → Switch to Cooperating.
  
- **Round N+1:** By cooperating, you help the stock recover.
  
- **Round N+2:** Once stock recovers above 50, resume Defecting.

This strategy ensures sustainable exploitation by adapting based on the resource's current state.

### Final Answer:
The optimal strategy is to defect when the stock exceeds half of its capacity and cooperate once it falls below that threshold. This balance maximizes gains while ensuring long-term sustainability.

\boxed{\text{Defect if stock > C/2; Cooperate otherwise}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_332 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Approach:**
   - Begin with Cooperate (C) in the first round to encourage others to Cooperate and maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation:**
   - Track each player's actions over time.
   - Use a threshold approach: Cooperate if the majority of players Cooperated in previous rounds; Defect if more than a certain percentage have Defected.

3. **Stock Level Considerations:**
   - Cooperate when the stock is high to allow for sustainable consumption.
   - Consider defecting when the stock is low, especially if others are exploiting the resource, to maximize immediate gains.

4. **Response to Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Cooperate with players who consistently Cooperate to maintain a stable resource and mutual benefits.
   - Defect against those who frequently Defect to exploit their actions and gain higher payoffs.

5. **Endgame Strategy (Last Few Rounds):**
   - In the last 10% of rounds, prioritize short-term gains by defecting more often, as future rounds have limited impact.

6. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If the stock is critically low, Cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow some recovery.
   - Be prepared to adjust strategy based on others' moves from the first round onwards.

This strategy balances exploiting opponents while maintaining resource sustainability when beneficial, adapting dynamically to maximize individual payoff over multiple rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_333 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a commons dilemma, we propose a strategy that adapts based on the current state of the resource. The goal is to maximize individual payoff while ensuring the resource does not become depleted.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Exploration**: Start by defecting to gauge others' behavior and assess the impact on the resource.
2. **Monitor Resource Levels**: Continuously track the stock level after each round to determine if it's increasing, decreasing, or stable.
3. **Adaptive Defection/Coooperation**:
   - If the current stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), defect to exploit the abundant resource.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to cooperating to help replenish the resource and prevent collapse.

### Decision Rule:
- **If Current Stock > Threshold (T)**: Defect.
- **Else**: Cooperate.

The threshold \( T \) is set dynamically based on capacity and player count. For example, with a capacity of 100 and \( n = 4 \), setting \( T = 50\% \) ensures that defecting doesn't risk immediate collapse, while cooperation below this level helps maintain sustainability.

### Example Application:
- **Round 1**: Defect to test the impact.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If stock remains above 50%, continue defecting.
  - If it drops below, switch to cooperating to aid recovery.

This approach ensures a balance between exploiting available resources and preserving them for future gains, preventing the tragedy of the commons while maximizing individual payoff over time.

### Final Answer
The optimal strategy is to defect when the current stock exceeds 50% of capacity and cooperate otherwise. This balances immediate gains with long-term resource preservation. The decision rule is:

**If Current Stock > 50% of Capacity: Defect; Else: Cooperate**

\boxed{\text{Defect if current stock exceeds 50% of capacity, else cooperate}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_334 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a dynamic and adaptive approach that takes advantage of opponents' behaviors while managing resource depletion. Here's a structured plan:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round**: Start by Cooperating (C) to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - If the stock is high (>75% capacity) and most opponents are Cooperating, Defect (D) to gain higher payoffs.
   - If the stock is moderate (25-75%), balance between C and D based on opponents' cooperation rates.
   - Track each opponent's behavior individually; defect against those who cooperate more and cooperate with frequent defectors.
3. **Low Stock**: When the stock drops below 25% capacity, always Cooperate to prevent collapse.
4. **Endgame (Last Few Rounds)**: Increase defection frequency as future rounds are limited.

### Decision Rules

- **First Round**: Cooperate to assess others' initial moves.
- **Middle Rounds**:
  - Calculate opponents' average cooperation rate (`opp_coop`).
  - If `current_stock > 0.75 * capacity` and `opp_coop > threshold`, Defect.
  - If `current_stock < 0.25 * capacity`, Cooperate to preserve resources.
  - For moderate stock levels, defect if opponents are mostly cooperating; else, cooperate.
- **Track Individual Opponents**: Adjust actions based on each opponent's past behavior—defect against cooperators and cooperate with defectors.

### Implementation

Here is the strategy in pseudocode:

```python
Initialize:
    cooperation_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    low_stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    opponents_coop_rates = {i: 1 for i in 1..n}  # Start assuming all cooperate

for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        current_stock = state.stock
        opp_coop = average(opponents_coop_rates.values())
        
        if current_stock > cooperation_threshold and opp_coop > threshold:
            action = D
        elif current_stock < low_stock_threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            # Balance based on past actions and trends
            if stock_trend is decreasing or opp_coop < another_threshold:
                action = C
            else:
                action = D
    
    for opponent in opponents:
        update opponents_coop_rates[opponent] with their recent action
    update history with this round's action

# Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of rounds)**: Increase defection frequency to maximize immediate payoffs.

# Stock Management:
- Monitor stock trends over time. If the stock is consistently decreasing, increase cooperation to allow recovery.
```

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round**: Start with C to encourage others to Cooperate.
- **Last Few Rounds**: Defect more to exploit remaining resources without worrying about future rounds.

### Exploitative Mindset Alignment

The strategy exploits opponents by defecting when they cooperate, especially in the early and middle rounds. It adapts to prevent resource collapse by cooperating when necessary, ensuring long-term sustainability while maximizing personal gain.

This approach dynamically balances exploitation with preservation, making it robust against various opponent behaviors and game states.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_335 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts to different opponent behaviors while maximizing payoffs, we can structure our approach as follows:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy balances exploiting others' cooperation when possible with preserving the resource to ensure long-term gains. It starts cooperatively, shifts to defecting when safe, and maximizes immediate payoff towards the game's end.

### Decision Rules

1. **Early Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Maintain a healthy stock level and encourage others to cooperate, allowing for growth and sustainable future payoffs.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Health:**
     - If the stock increased from the previous round (indicating resilience), defect to exploit others' cooperation.
     - If the stock did not increase or is shrinking, switch back to cooperating to prevent further depletion.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are limited and the impact of resource depletion is less concerning.

### Handling Edge Cases

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate to observe others' behavior and allow initial stock growth.

- **Stock Near Capacity:**
  - If the stock reaches capacity, defect as others' cooperation keeps consumption low enough for growth.

- **Resource Depletion:**
  - If all players defect, switch immediately to Cooperating once detection occurs, though impact may be limited in such scenarios.

### Summary
This strategy is adaptive and robust, dynamically adjusting actions based on the resource's state and opponents' behaviors. It exploits cooperation when safe and preserves resources when necessary, ensuring a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

---

**Final Answer:**

The exploitative strategy balances cooperation and defection based on stock health and game progression:

1. **Early Rounds (First 20%):** Cooperate to build the stock.
2. **Middle Rounds:** Defect if stock grows; Cooperate otherwise.
3. **Late Rounds (Last 20%):** Always Defect.

This approach maximizes payoffs while adapting to different opponent behaviors and resource states, ensuring both exploitation opportunities and sustainability.

\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{1. Early Rounds (First 20%): Cooperate} \\
&\text{2. Middle Rounds:} \\
&\quad \text{- Defect if stock increased from previous round} \\
&\quad \text{- Cooperate otherwise} \\
&\text{3. Late Rounds (Last 20%): Always Defect}
\end{aligned}

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

---

### **Strategy Overview**
The strategy is designed to maximize payoffs by exploiting opponents' cooperation while ensuring resource sustainability. It adapts dynamically based on other players' actions and current stock levels.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Reasoning: Starts with a positive action to encourage others and maintain high stock levels for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (until the last few):**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players over the last 3-5 rounds.
   - **Step 2:** Check if the current stock level is above 80% of capacity.
   - **Conditions:**
     - If both the cooperation rate >70% and stock >80%, **Cooperate.**
     - Otherwise, **Defect.**

3. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Reasoning: Maximizes immediate payoffs as future rounds are negligible.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **Low Stock Levels (<80% capacity):** Switch to Defecting regardless of cooperation rate to exploit remaining resources before depletion.
- **High Defection Rate (>30% in recent rounds):** Start defecting more to avoid being exploited while others deplete the resource.

---

### **Rationale**
The strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability. By Cooperating when others do, it maintains a stable resource level, allowing for higher payoffs over time. However, it quickly adapts to exploit opponents' defection and maximizes immediate benefits in the final rounds.

---

This approach ensures adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors while aligning with an exploitative mindset to optimize personal payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_337 = '''
To address this problem, we need to develop a strategy that balances between cooperation to maintain resource sustainability and defection to maximize immediate gains. The strategy should adapt based on the current stock level relative to capacity.

### Approach
The proposed strategy uses a static threshold to decide whether to cooperate or defect:
1. **Cooperate** if the current stock is above 70% of capacity.
2. **Defect** otherwise.

This approach aims to sustain the resource when it's abundant and switch to maximizing gains as the resource depletes.

### Solution Code
```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self, initial_stock):
        self.capacity = initial_stock
        # Define threshold percentages
        self.cooperate_threshold = 0.7  # 70% of capacity

    def action(self, current_stock, others_actions=None):
        # Determine if current stock is above the cooperate threshold
        if current_stock > self.capacity * self.cooperate_threshold:
            return "cooperate"
        else:
            return "defect"

# Example usage:
initial_stock = 100  # example capacity
strategy = Strategy(initial_stock)
current_stock = 85    # example current stock
print(f"Action: {strategy.action(current_stock)}")
```

### Explanation
- **Cooperate Threshold (70%):** When the current stock exceeds 70% of the initial capacity, cooperation helps maintain sustainable use, ensuring future rounds have a replenished resource.
- **Defect Otherwise:** If the stock is below 70%, defecting maximizes immediate gains as the resource is already in a depleted state.

This strategy balances between long-term sustainability and short-term gains based on the current state of the resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_338 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing individual gain while preserving a shared resource, we can implement a strategy that balances exploitation with conservation. Here's how it works:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Assess Cooperation Rate:** Evaluate the percentage of other players who cooperated in the last round.
2. **Check Resource Level:** Determine if the current stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
3. **Decision Making:**
   - If both conditions are met (high cooperation rate and sufficient resource level), defect to exploit the resource.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to encourage others to continue contributing and preserve the resource.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Evaluate Last Round's Cooperation:**
   - Determine how many other players cooperated in the last round.
   - Calculate the percentage of cooperating players relative to the total number of players excluding yourself.

2. **Determine Resource Level:**
   - Check if the current stock level is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 50% of maximum capacity).

3. **Make Decision Based on Conditions:**
   - If cooperation rate > X% and resource level > Y%, defect to exploit.
   - Else, cooperate to sustain the resource.

### Example Application:
- Suppose in a group of four players, you decide to defect only if at least 70% of others (i.e., at least 2 out of 3) cooperated and the stock is above 50% capacity.
- This ensures that you exploit when it's sustainable but switch to cooperation when necessary.

### Conclusion:
This strategy allows for maximizing personal gain by defecting under favorable conditions while preserving the resource through cooperation when needed. It balances self-interest with sustainability, promoting a healthier dynamic among participants.

The exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize individual payoffs by adapting to others' behaviors while considering the state of the common pool. Here's a structured approach:

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - Start by Cooperating to observe others' behavior and establish a baseline.
   
2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Track the number of players who Defected in previous rounds.
   - If more than 60% of players Defected in recent rounds, defect to exploit their strategy, as the high stock level can tolerate additional depletion.
   - If less than or equal to 60% Defected, Cooperate to maintain a stable stock level and avoid over-depletion.

3. **Later Rounds (Last 20%):**
   - Prioritize defecting to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited.
   - If the stock is low, consider Cooperating to prevent collapse, ensuring some payoff in the final rounds.

4. **Stock Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Use a dynamic threshold based on the number of remaining rounds and current stock level:
     - **High Stock (Above 80% capacity):** More tolerance for defecting.
     - **Low Stock (Below 60% capacity):** Increase Cooperating to preserve resources.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to gather information about others' strategies.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there's no future impact.
- **Stock Depletion:** If stock is critically low, Cooperate to prevent further collapse and ensure some resource remains for the next round.

### Strategy Summary:
The strategy dynamically adjusts between Cooperating and Defecting based on observed behavior of other players and the current state of the common pool. It exploits opportunities when others Defect while preserving resources when necessary to avoid long-term negative impacts.

This approach ensures that the strategy is adaptive, robust, and aligned with an exploitative mindset, aiming to maximize individual payoffs in a competitive environment.

To address the problem of deciding whether to defect or cooperate in each round based on the current stock level relative to the threshold, a simple yet effective strategy is proposed. The decision rule is based on comparing the current stock against a predetermined threshold, which helps balance immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine Threshold:** Set a threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) to decide when to defect or cooperate.
2. **Current Stock Check:** Compare the current stock level with this threshold in each round.
3. **Decision Making:** If the stock is above the threshold, choose to Defect for higher immediate payoff. If below, Cooperate to preserve and rebuild the resource.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to defect when the current stock exceeds 80% of capacity and cooperate otherwise. This ensures maximizing immediate gains while maintaining sustainability for future rounds.

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we aim to maximize our own payoff while adapting to other players' behaviors. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy is adaptive, balancing exploitation with preservation of the common pool to avoid collapse. It consists of three phases based on the game's progression:

1. **Early Rounds (Exploitation Phase):**
   - **Action:** Defect as much as possible.
   - **Rationale:** The stock starts at maximum capacity, allowing safe defection without immediate consequences.

2. **Middle Rounds (Adaptation Phase):**
   - **Monitor Stock and Player Behavior:**
     - Track the stock level after each round.
     - Observe the number of cooperators vs. defectors among other players.
   - **Decision Rules:**
     - If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 2n) or if many others are defecting, switch to cooperating to prevent rapid depletion.

3. **Late Rounds (Final Exploitation Phase):**
   - **Action:** Return to defecting.
   - **Rationale:** With no future rounds left, prioritize maximum immediate payoff regardless of the stock level.

### Detailed Decision Rules
1. **Initial Play:**
   - In the first round(s), defect to exploit the high initial stock without concern for long-term effects.

2. **Mid-Game Adaptation:**
   - Calculate a critical threshold (e.g., 2n) based on the game's parameters.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold or if more than half of other players are defecting, switch to cooperation to preserve the resource and ensure future payoffs.

3. **End-Game Exploitation:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 20%), revert to defecting to maximize immediate gains without worrying about depleting the stock for non-existent future rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling
- **First Round:** Always defect due to high initial stock.
- **Low Stock Situations:** If stock is critically low, prioritize cooperation to avoid collapse and maintain payoffs in remaining rounds.
- **Last Rounds:** Defect maximally as there's no future penalty for depleting the stock.

### Pseudocode
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, n_players):
    # Initial exploration: defect early on
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'D'
    
    # Critical threshold based on game parameters
    critical_threshold = 2 * n_players
    
    # Check if stock is below critical level or too many defectors
    stock_low = current_stock < critical_threshold
    # Assume we can estimate number of defectors from history
    num_defectors = ...  # Historical data analysis
    many_defectors = num_defectors > (n_players / 2)
    
    if stock_low or many_defectors:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # If near end, defect maximally
        if round_number > total_rounds - 3:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Continue defecting as long as it's safe
            return 'D'
```

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with adaptive preservation, ensuring maximum payoff while mitigating risks of resource collapse.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_342 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing personal payoff in a repeated game where players can either cooperate or defect, while considering the impact on future rounds, we developed an exploitative strategy that balances immediate gains with sustainable play.

### Approach
The strategy is designed to exploit opponents when they cooperate and prevent being exploited by others when they defect. It also conserves resources when necessary to ensure future payoff potential. The approach involves:

1. **Immediate Exploitation**: Defect in the first round to exploit any initial cooperation from other players.
2. **Threshold-Based Decisions**:
   - **High Stock Levels (>80% capacity)**: Defect to maximize immediate gains with minimal risk of severe future depletion.
   - **Low Stock Levels (<30% capacity)**: Cooperate to allow regrowth and prevent further stock depletion, ensuring sustainable exploitation in future rounds.
   - **Moderate Stock Levels**: Adjust based on opponents' recent behavior. If a majority are defecting, defect as well; otherwise, exploit their cooperation by defecting.
3. **Final Round Exploitation**: Defect in the last round to maximize immediate payoff without considering future consequences.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, remaining_rounds, opponents_history):
    threshold_high = 0.8
    threshold_low = 0.3
    defect_proportion_threshold = 0.5
    
    if current_stock > threshold_high:
        return 'Defect'
    elif current_stock < threshold_low:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        recent_rounds = min(len(opponents_history), 5)
        recent_defects = sum(1 for action in opponents_history[-recent_rounds:] if action == 'Defect')
        defect_proportion = recent_defects / recent_rounds
        
        if defect_proportion > defect_proportion_threshold:
            return 'Defect'
        else:
            return 'Defect'  # Exploit cooperation by defecting
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round**: The strategy begins with a defect to exploit any initial cooperation, setting the stage for observing opponents' responses.
- **High Stock Levels**: When resources are abundant (above 80% capacity), defecting is safe and profitable without significant future risks.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Cooperate to allow resource regeneration, preventing further depletion that would hinder future exploitation opportunities.
- **Moderate Stock Levels**: The strategy adapts based on recent opponent behavior. If a majority of opponents are defecting, the player defects to avoid being exploited. Otherwise, they exploit the cooperation of others by defecting for higher immediate payoffs.

This approach ensures a balance between maximizing immediate gains and maintaining sustainable play for future rounds, adapting dynamically to different game states and opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_343 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we balance exploiting opponents while preserving the resource for future gains. The strategy adapts based on opponents' behavior and current stock levels, ensuring maximum payoff without complete depletion.

### Strategy Description:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate ('C').
   - **Rationale**: Gather information about opponents' actions to inform future decisions.

2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - **Assess Opponents' Behavior**: Calculate the average cooperation rate of opponents over previous rounds.
     - If **average cooperation > 50%**, defect ('D') to exploit their willingness to cooperate, maximizing immediate payoff.
     - Else, cooperate ('C') to prevent resource depletion and encourage mutual preservation.
   - **Stock Level Check**:
     - If **stock < 30% of capacity**, always cooperate to allow stock recovery and future growth.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Defect ('D').
   - **Rationale**: Maximize payoff in final rounds since there's no future impact from depletion.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to observe opponents.
   - **Low Stock (<30%)**: Prioritize cooperation to prevent further depletion and encourage recovery.
   - **Last Round**: Defect to exploit any remaining cooperation, as there's no future round.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock_level, capacity, opponent_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to gather information
    elif round_number > (total_rounds - 3):  # Last few rounds
        return 'D'  # Exploit by defecting
    else:
        # Calculate average cooperation of opponents in previous rounds
        if len(opponent_actions) == 0:
            avg_coop = 1.0  # Assume all Cooperate if no history
        else:
            avg_coop = sum(action == 'C' for action in opponent_actions) / len(opponent_actions)
        
        # Check current stock level
        if stock_level < capacity * 0.3:  # Low stock, preserve
            return 'C'
        elif avg_coop > 0.5:  # If most opponents are Cooperating, exploit by defecting
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent further depletion and encourage others

# Edge cases handled in the function
```

### Explanation:

This strategy exploits opponents when they cooperate but adapts by cooperating if opponents defect too much or stock levels are low. It maximizes immediate payoffs while ensuring sustainability, balancing exploitation with preservation for long-term gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_344 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Objective:**
   Maximize total payoff by exploiting others' cooperation while ensuring sustainable stock levels for future rounds.

2. **Decision Rules:**

   a. **Initial Round (t=1):**
      - Cooperate to observe opponents' initial behavior and set the stage for potential exploitation.

   b. **Subsequent Rounds (t=2 to r-1):**
      - Calculate current_stock and recent_defection_rate.
      - If current_stock > 70% of capacity:
        - Defect to exploit high payoffs with minimal impact on future rounds.
      - If current_stock < 30% of capacity:
        - Cooperate to allow stock recovery, ensuring higher future gains.
      - Else (current_stock between 30-70%):
        - If recent_defection_rate < 20%: Defect to exploit others' cooperation.
        - Else: Cooperate to avoid over-depletion.

   c. **Last Few Rounds (t=r-1 and t=r):**
      - Shift towards defecting more to maximize immediate gains, as future rounds are limited or nonexistent.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**

   a. **First Round:**
      - Cooperate to establish a baseline for observing opponents' behavior.

   b. **Last Round (t=r):**
      - Defect regardless of stock level since there's no future punishment.

   c. **Stock Near Capacity:**
      - Safe to defect as the stock will recover quickly.

   d. **Stock Near Depletion:**
      - Cooperate to allow recovery; otherwise, next round might have very low or zero stock.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments:**

   - Calculate thresholds dynamically based on remaining rounds and current stock trend.
   - Track stock trends over time; if steadily decreasing, increase tendency to cooperate.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, past_actions, round_number, total_rounds, capacity):
    n = len(past_actions) + 1  # Number of players including self

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Initial move to observe opponents

    recent_defections = sum(1 for actions in past_actions.values() if actions[-1] == 'D') / (n - 1)
    
    if current_stock > capacity * 0.7:
        return 'D'  # Exploit when stock is high
    elif current_stock < capacity * 0.3:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to allow recovery
    else:
        if recent_defections < 0.2:
            return 'D'  # Exploit others' cooperation
        else:
            return 'C'

    # For last few rounds, prioritize defecting
    if round_number >= total_rounds - 1:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with sustainable resource management, ensuring adaptability across various opponent behaviors and game conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_345 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by adaptively choosing actions based on current stock level, previous rounds' outcomes, and opponents' behaviors.

---

### **Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect**

1. **First Round (t = 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Reasoning: Sets a cooperative baseline without significant risk when the stock is at maximum capacity.

2. **Middle Rounds (t = 2 to r-1):**
   - Evaluate the previous round's outcomes:
     - If in the last round, **≥75% of players Cooperated** AND the current stock **S ≥ 60% of capacity**, then:
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - Reasoning: Exploit when others are maintaining the resource and it is sufficiently robust to handle additional exploitation.
     - Else if in the last round, **>50% of players Defected** OR current stock **S < 30% of capacity**, then:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - Reasoning: Preserve resources when there's a risk of depletion due to others' actions or low stock levels.
     - Otherwise:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - Reasoning: Maintain cautious exploitation by default unless specific conditions for defecting are met.

3. **Last Round (t = r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Reasoning: Final opportunity to exploit without concern for future rounds' impacts.

---

### **Rationale and Adaptation**

- **Exploitation (Defect) Conditions:**
  - Safeguarded by high stock levels and significant cooperation from others, ensuring that the resource can sustain the exploitation without immediate collapse.
  
- **Preservation (Cooperate) Conditions:**
  - Triggered when there's a risk of rapid depletion due to either low stock or excessive defection in previous rounds.

---

### **Testing Scenario Walkthrough**

**Example:** n = 4, capacity = 100

1. **Round 1 (t=1):**
   - You Cooperate; others Defect.
     - Stock after consumption: 0.
     - Growth remains 0 as S_remaining is 0.
     - New stock: 0.

2. **Round 2 (t=2) [if applicable]:**
   - Current stock S = 0 (<30% capacity).
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Despite actions, payoff will be 0 due to depleted stock.

---

### **Conclusion**

This strategy balances exploitation with preservation by dynamically adapting to the game's state and opponents' behaviors, ensuring maximum individual payoff while mitigating risks of resource collapse.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_346 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing your payoff in a game where players can either Cooperate or Defect, we've developed a strategic approach based on observing others' actions and the state of the shared resource. Here's a concise step-by-step explanation of the strategy:

1. **First Round**: Start by defecting to gain an immediate higher payoff since there is no prior history to influence your decision.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Observe Previous Actions**: Count the number of players who Cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Calculate Proportion**: Determine the proportion of Cooperators relative to the total number of players.
   - **Dynamic Thresholding**: If the proportion of Cooperators exceeds a predetermined threshold (e.g., 50%), defect again to exploit their efforts. This is because sufficient cooperation ensures the resource doesn't collapse, allowing you to benefit from higher payoffs without immediate negative consequences.
   - **Preserve Resource**: If the proportion of Cooperators falls below the threshold, switch to Cooperating. This helps sustain the resource, preventing its depletion and ensuring future opportunities for exploitation.

3. **Adjustments**: Consider refining the strategy by averaging cooperation levels over multiple rounds or adjusting the threshold based on observed trends in stock dynamics to enhance robustness against short-term fluctuations.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Adaptively defect when others cooperate sufficiently, else cooperate to preserve resources.}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_347 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** The initial cooperation allows observation of opponents' behaviors and assessment of the stock's health without immediate risk of rapid depletion.

**2. Adaptive Play:**
   - **Cooperation Threshold Calculation:**
     - Determine a threshold based on current stock level relative to capacity and rounds remaining.
     - Example: If stock is above 70% of capacity with more than half the rounds left, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - **If stock > threshold:** Cooperate
     - **Else:** Defect

**3. Exploitation Based on Opponents' Behavior:**
   - **Monitoring Opponents:** Track the frequency of cooperation and defection among opponents.
   - **Exploitation Tactics:**
     - **High Cooperation Among Opponents:** Increase defection to capitalize on others' contributions, maximizing personal gain while minimizing individual impact on stock depletion.
     - **High Defection Among Opponents:** Consider reducing defection to sustain the resource for longer-term gains and mitigate potential over-depletion.

**4. Late Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Increase Defection
   - **Rationale:** With fewer future rounds, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff even if it risks stock depletion, as there's less incentive to preserve resources for non-existent future gains.

This strategy balances exploitation with adaptive behavior, ensuring responsiveness to both the game's state and opponents' strategies while aiming to maximize individual payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_348 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' behaviors while maintaining sustainable resource use.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**
The strategy adaptively switches between Cooperating (C) and Defecting (D) based on:
- **Stock level (S):** Higher S allows more D without depleting resources.
- **Opponents' recent actions:** Exploit patterns of cooperation or defection.

#### **When to Cooperate:**
1. **Low Stock Levels:** If \( S < \text{threshold}_C \), Cooperate to allow stock regrowth and prevent collapse.
2. **High Defection by Others:** If most opponents Defect, Cooperating balances consumption and avoids rapid depletion.

#### **When to Defect:**
1. **High Stock Levels:** If \( S > \text{threshold}_D \), Defect to exploit the surplus for higher payoff.
2. **High Cooperation by Others:** If many Cooperate, Defect to gain a larger share while opponents sustain resource levels.

---

### **2. Thresholds**
Adjust thresholds dynamically based on game history and opponent behavior:
- **Initial threshold:** Set \( \text{threshold}_C = 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \) and \( \text{threshold}_D = 0.75 \times \text{capacity} \).
- **Adapt thresholds over time:**
  - Increase \( \text{threshold}_C \) if opponents frequently Defect.
  - Decrease \( \text{threshold}_D \) if opponents often Cooperate.

---

### **3. First Round Behavior**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Start by Cooperating to observe opponents' initial moves and avoid early stock depletion.

---

### **4. Last Round Behavior**
- **Action:** Defect (D)
- **Rationale:** In the final round, maximize immediate payoff without worrying about future consequences.

---

### **5. Mid-Round Adjustments**
- Monitor opponents' actions over time.
- If a player consistently Cooperates:
  - Exploit them by defecting when they Cooperate.
- If a player frequently Defects:
  - Cooperate to avoid excessive stock depletion and sustain long-term gains.

---

### **6. Stock Management**
- Track stock levels and growth rates.
- Avoid driving the stock too low, as this limits future payoffs for all players.
- Use the growth formula to predict future stock levels based on current actions.

---

### **7. Exploitation of Opponents**
- Identify opponents who:
  - Cooperate in early rounds but may switch later.
  - Defect when others Cooperate, allowing you to gain more while they sustain resources.
- Adapt your strategy to exploit these behaviors, e.g., Cooperate when opponents Defect and vice versa.

---

### **8. Edge Cases**
- **Very low stock:** Always Cooperate to allow regrowth.
- **Full capacity stock:** Defect if others Cooperate; else, Cooperate to maintain balance.

---

### **9. Pseudocode Summary**

```python
def decide_action(stock_history, opponent_actions):
    # Initialize thresholds based on game parameters
    threshold_C = 0.5 * capacity
    threshold_D = 0.75 * capacity

    # Adjust thresholds dynamically
    if round_number > 1:
        cooperation_rate = sum([action == 'C' for actions in opponent_actions for action in actions]) / (n * (round_number - 1))
        if cooperation_rate < 0.3:
            threshold_C += 0.1 * capacity
        elif cooperation_rate > 0.7:
            threshold_D -= 0.1 * capacity

    # First round behavior
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Last round behavior
    if round_number == r:
        return 'D'

    # Mid-round decisions
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    
    if current_stock < threshold_C or cooperation_rate > 0.7:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

---

### **10. Summary**
This strategy balances short-term exploitation of opponents with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting behaviors based on stock levels, opponent actions, and game history. It aims to maximize individual payoffs while avoiding catastrophic resource depletion.

**Key Concepts:**
- Exploit cooperation and defection patterns.
- Maintain thresholds for sustainable resource use.
- Adapt decisions based on real-time observations of the game state and opponent behavior.

By following this approach, the strategy can outperform opponents in a wide range of scenarios while ensuring long-term viability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_349 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts to opponents' behaviors while maximizing personal payoff, follow this structured approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of total rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning**: Establish a baseline and observe others' behavior to encourage cooperation and maintain a stable stock level.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 60% of total rounds)**:
   - **Monitor Others' Behavior**:
     - Calculate the moving average of other players' cooperation rates over the last few rounds (e.g., 5 rounds).
   - **Decision Rules Based on Cooperation Rate**:
     - If more than X% of other players are Cooperating, Defect to exploit their contributions.
     - If less than or equal to X%, Cooperate to prevent stock collapse and encourage others to Cooperate.
   - **Adjust Thresholds (X) Based on Stock Level**:
     - Higher stock allows a higher threshold for defection.
     - Lower stock necessitates a lower threshold, promoting cooperation.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 20% of total rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Increase defection rate.
   - **Reasoning**: Maximize immediate payoff as the game nears its end without worrying about future consequences.

4. **Stock-Based Adjustments**:
   - If current stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), be more willing to Defect when others Cooperate.
   - Below that, prefer Cooperate to allow stock growth and prevent collapse.

5. **Adaptation**:
   - Periodically reassess the cooperation rate and adjust thresholds dynamically based on observed behavior.
   - If defecting leads to significant stock depletion, reduce defection in subsequent rounds to allow recovery.

### Edge Cases

- **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage others. Adjust strategy in next rounds if others defect.
- **Last Few Rounds**: Defect more to exploit any remaining cooperation without worrying about future consequences.
- **Stock Near Capacity**: Can afford to defect when others Cooperate.
- **Stock Low**: Prefer Cooperate to help regrow stock and sustain higher payoffs.

### Testing the Strategy

- Use examples with different numbers of players, capacities, and rounds to validate the strategy's adaptability.
- Monitor how the strategy responds to varying cooperation rates and stock levels, ensuring it maximizes payoff while preventing collapse.

### Conclusion

This strategy balances exploitation by defecting when others maintain the resource and cooperation to prevent over-depletion. It dynamically adapts based on observed behavior and current stock levels, maximizing personal payoff while remaining resilient to various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_350 = '''
To address the problem, we develop an adaptive strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by monitoring opponent behavior and current stock levels.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Exploration (First Few Rounds):**
   - The strategy begins by defecting in the initial rounds to observe opponents' actions.
   - This phase helps gather data on how many players are Cooperating or Defecting, providing insights into their strategies.

2. **Data Collection and Analysis:**
   - Track the number of Cooperators and Defectors in each round.
   - Monitor changes in stock levels after each round to assess the impact of collective actions.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - If a significant proportion (e.g., more than 50%) of players are Cooperating, continue defecting to exploit their cooperation for higher immediate payoffs.
   - If the stock level drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), switch to Cooperate to prevent further decline and ensure sustainable growth.

4. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Examine trends in stock levels over time. If the stock remains stable or increases despite defecting, continue with that strategy.
   - If the stock consistently decreases even when others Cooperate, it may indicate too many Defectors; consider switching to Cooperate to preserve future gains.

5. **Final Rounds Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%), if the stock is still above a certain level, continue defecting to maximize immediate payoffs.
   - If the stock is low, switch to Cooperate to prevent it from crashing before the game ends.

6. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - The critical thresholds for switching strategies (e.g., 60% of capacity) may need adjustment based on observed outcomes and opponent behavior.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is an adaptive approach that starts with defecting to exploit Cooperators, then switches to Cooperating if the stock drops below a critical threshold or too many players are Defecting. This balances immediate gains with sustainable practices for future rounds.

\boxed{\text{Adaptive Strategy}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_351 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that maximizes payoffs while adapting to various opponent behaviors, we can outline the following strategy:

### Strategy Outline: Exploitative Adaptive Play (EAP)

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff by exploiting others' strategies while balancing immediate gains and future sustainability.

#### 1. **Decision Rules**

- **Initial Round (Round 1):** Always Defect (D) to capture higher immediate payoffs and establish a precedent.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-3):**
  - **Stock Check:** If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, continue Defecting (D). This threshold ensures that growth can sustain the resource level.
  - **Opponent Behavior:** Monitor the proportion of defects in previous rounds. If a significant number of players are defecting, switch to Cooperate (C) to allow the stock to recover and prevent over-depletion.

- **Final Rounds (Last 3 Rounds):**
  - Always Defect (D). The focus shifts to maximizing immediate payoffs since there's minimal impact on future rounds.

#### 2. **Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round:** Start with D to exploit others who might cooperate, setting a tone that encourages them to defect in response.
  
- **Last Few Rounds:** Switch to always defecting as the game approaches its end, prioritizing immediate gains without concern for future stock sustainability.

#### 3. **Exploitative Mindset**

- Exploit opponents' tendency to cooperate by defecting when the stock is high and growth can sustain it.
- Adapt to others' strategies: if many defect, switch to cooperate to prevent resource collapse and secure longer-term payoffs.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def decision(current_round, total_rounds, stock_level, past_actions):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return D
    elif current_round > (r - 3):
        return D
    else:
        # Calculate proportion of defects in past rounds
        defectors = sum(1 for action in past_actions if action == D)
        prop_defect = defectors / len(past_actions) if len(past_actions) > 0 else 0
        
        if stock_level >= 0.75 * n * capacity:
            # If stock is sufficiently high, defect
            return D
        elif prop_defect < 0.3:
            # If few are defecting, continue defecting to exploit cooperation
            return D
        else:
            # Switch to cooperate to sustain the resource
            return C
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Defection (Round 1):** Sets a competitive tone, potentially encouraging others to defect in subsequent rounds.
  
- **Dynamic Decision-Making:** Balances immediate gains with sustainability by considering both stock levels and opponents' behaviors. High stock allows exploitation through defecting, while low stock or high defect rates prompt cooperation.

- **Final Rounds Exploitation:** Maximizes payoffs in the game's closing stages without worrying about future consequences, ensuring no missed opportunities for gain.

This strategy effectively navigates the trade-offs between immediate payoffs and long-term sustainability, adapting to different opponent behaviors to maximize overall returns.

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Early Rounds (First 30% of total rounds):**
     - Defect whenever possible, especially when the stock is above a high threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity), to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Middle Rounds:**
     - Monitor the current stock level and others' actions.
     - If the stock remains stable or grows despite defection, continue defecting.
     - If the stock drops significantly due to many defections, switch to cooperating temporarily to allow recovery.
   - **Late Rounds (Last 30% of total rounds):**
     - Be cautious with defection. If the stock is low, consider cooperation to prevent sudden crashes in final rounds where others might defect.
   - **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
     - Start with thresholds X=80% and Y=50%. Adjust dynamically based on observed trends:
       - Lower X if defecting causes significant drops without recovery.
       - Raise Y if cooperation is not needed due to stable stock.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always defect to maximize initial payoff.
   - **Last Round:** Defect unless the stock is critically low, in which case cooperate to avoid a crash affecting payoffs.

3. **Exploitation and Adaptation:**
   - Track opponents' actions to infer their strategies but focus on overall trends for scalability.
   - Introduce unpredictability by occasionally defecting below thresholds if others are likely to cooperate, exploiting their willingness to sustain the resource.

4. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - Use observed stock levels and growth rates to adjust thresholds dynamically.
   - Balance between immediate exploitation and long-term sustainability by cooperating when necessary to prevent resource collapse.

This strategy aims to maximize personal payoff while maintaining enough resource for future exploitation, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors and changing game conditions.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' behavior while considering the game's state dynamics. It adapts dynamically based on stock levels, remaining rounds, and opponents' actions.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**

#### **Early Rounds (First 25% of Total Rounds)**
- **Initial Move:** Cooperate in the first round to observe others' initial strategies.
- **Subsequent Moves:** Adjust based on observed behavior:
  - If more than half of players Cooperated, defect to exploit their cooperation.
  - If most Defected, switch to Cooperating to prevent rapid stock depletion.

#### **Middle Rounds (Remaining 50% of Total Rounds)**
- Use thresholds and past behavior to decide actions:
  - Calculate a dynamic threshold `T` considering stock level `S`, remaining rounds, and the proportion of Cooperators in past rounds.
  - If `S >= T`, Defect; otherwise, Cooperate.

#### **Last Few Rounds (Last 25% of Total Rounds)**
- Focus on maximizing immediate payoffs:
  - Always Defect unless others are heavily defecting, in which case Cooperate to allow some stock growth for potential future exploitation.

---

### **2. Adaptive Threshold Calculation**

The threshold `T` is adjusted based on:

1. **Stock Level (`S`):** Higher thresholds encourage defection when the stock is robust.
2. **Remaining Rounds (`rem`):** Lower thresholds as rounds decrease to prevent over-depletion.
3. **Opponents' Behavior:** If more Cooperators, increase `T`; if more Defectors, decrease `T`.

**Pseudocode for Threshold Adjustment:**

```python
def calculate_threshold(S, rem, cooperator_proportion):
    base = max(2 * n, S / 2)
    behavior_adjustment = (cooperator_proportion - 0.5) * (capacity / 4)
    round_adjustment = (rem / r) * (base / 2)
    T = base + behavior_adjustment + round_adjustment
    return max(T, 2 * n)
```

---

### **3. Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to assess others' strategies.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
- **Low Stock (S < 2n):** Cooperate to prevent complete depletion and enable stock growth.

---

### **4. Exploitation Mechanism**

- Monitor opponents' actions over time to identify trends or patterns.
- Exploit cooperation by defecting when others sustain the stock.
- Preserve stock by Cooperating when others heavily Defect, setting up future exploitation opportunities.

**Pseudocode for Action Selection:**

```python
def choose_action(S, rem, cooperator_proportion):
    T = calculate_threshold(S, rem, cooperator_proportion)
    if S >= T:
        return D  # Defect to exploit
    else:
        return C  # Cooperate to preserve stock

# In last few rounds (e.g., last 5% of total rounds), prioritize immediate gain
if rem <= r / 20:
    return D
```

---

### **5. Summary**

- The strategy begins by Cooperating to observe others, then adapts based on thresholds influenced by stock levels, remaining rounds, and opponents' behavior.
- It prioritizes exploitation of Cooperators while preserving the resource when necessary.
- Adjustments in the last rounds ensure maximum payoff without regard for future consequences.

This adaptive approach balances immediate gains with sustainable exploitation, making it robust against diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_354 = '''
To effectively balance exploitation and sustainability while maximizing payoffs, we employ an **Exploitative Adaptive Strategy (EAS)**. This strategy adapts based on current conditions and past behavior, ensuring optimal outcomes in both cooperative and exploitative scenarios.

**Strategy:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - In the first round, defect to gain maximum payoff when stock is at its highest capacity.
   
2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Check Current Stock Level:**
     - If above a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), exploit by defecting if others are still cooperating.
     - If below the threshold, cooperate to preserve and allow stock recovery.
   - **Determine Others' Behavior:**
     - Track recent defectors. If less than 40% of players have been defecting, continue exploiting by defecting.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoff with no future considerations.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First and Last Rounds:** Always defect to exploit highest capacity and prevent future losses.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate to encourage growth, preventing resource crash.

This strategy dynamically adjusts actions based on current conditions and past behaviors, ensuring a balance between exploitation and sustainability for maximum total payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_355 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents while maintaining sustainability of the common pool resource.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Early Rounds Exploitation (Defect):**
   - **Condition:** Current stock \( S \) is above 0.6 × capacity.
   - **Action:** Defect (D).
     - Rationale: High stock allows for exploitation without immediate risk of resource collapse, as growth can sustain or increase the stock.

2. **Mid Rounds Adaptation:**
   - Monitor stock changes after each round to infer opponent behavior.
   - If observed stock depletion is significantly higher than expected, switch to cooperation in subsequent rounds to preserve remaining resources.

3. **Late Rounds Preservation (Cooperate):**
   - In the last 20% of rounds (e.g., last 1/5th), always cooperate.
     - Rationale: Preserve what's left for maximum payoff without depleting further, as future exploitation opportunities are limited.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment Based on Stock Changes:**
   - After each round, compare actual stock (\( S_{\text{next}} \)) with expected stock based on assumed opponent actions.
     - If \( S_{\text{next}} < \text{expected} \), infer higher defect rates; switch to cooperation earlier.
     - If \( S_{\text{next}} > \text{expected} \), continue defecting as opponents are likely cooperating.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round (Round 1):**
  - Stock is at capacity, so defect (D) for maximum initial payoff.

- **Stock Below Threshold (S ≤ 0.6 × capacity):**
  - Cooperate to prevent rapid depletion and ensure sustainable growth for future rounds.

- **Stock Near Capacity:**
  - Continue exploiting by defecting, as the buffer allows for recovery through growth mechanisms.

---

### **Strategy Summary in Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
Initialize threshold = 0.6 × capacity
total_rounds = r
late_rounds_threshold = total_rounds * 0.2

For each round t from 1 to total_rounds:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    If t < (total_rounds - late_rounds_threshold):
        If current_stock > threshold:
            Action = D
        Else:
            Action = C
    Else:
        Action = C
    
    Perform action and record payoff
    Update stock history for next round's decision

End For
```

---

### **Rationale:**

- **Exploitation in Early Rounds:**  
  Exploit when the resource is abundant, maximizing short-term gains while allowing growth to sustain future rounds.

- **Adaptation Based on Opponent Behavior:**  
  By monitoring stock changes, adjust strategy dynamically. If opponents are defecting aggressively, switch to cooperation to prevent resource collapse and ensure sustainable payoffs in later rounds.

- **Preservation in Late Rounds:**  
  Switch to cooperation in the final rounds to maximize remaining payoff without further depleting the resource, ensuring higher returns when future exploitation is no longer possible.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to exploit opponents while preserving resources for continued success.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_356 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy in this scenario, we can follow these steps:

1. **Assess Current Stock Level**: Begin by evaluating the current stock level relative to its capacity.

2. **Decision Rule Based on Threshold**:
   - **Defect** if the current stock is above 75% of capacity. This allows for maximizing immediate payoff while keeping the risk of total depletion low.
   - **Cooperate** if the current stock is below or equal to 75% of capacity. This helps prevent further significant depletion, preserving the resource for potential future exploitation.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**: While maintaining a base threshold (e.g., 75%), adjust your strategy dynamically based on observed trends in stock levels and other players' actions over time.

**Final Decision Rule:**

- If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, defect.
- If the current stock is at or below 75% of capacity, cooperate.

This approach balances immediate gain with strategic preservation to sustain exploitation opportunities.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_357 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first one or two rounds, default to Cooperate (C). This helps build up the stock and sets a baseline for observing others' behaviors.

2. **Observation and Exploitation:**
   - After the initial rounds, monitor the number of players defecting each round.
   - If the majority are Cooperating (indicative by high stock levels), start Defecting (D) to exploit their cooperation, maximizing immediate payoff without causing significant stock depletion.

3. **Threshold-Based Switching:**
   - Establish a critical threshold for the stock level. If the stock drops below this level due to excessive Defection, switch back to Cooperating.
   - The threshold can be set dynamically based on historical data and current consumption rates to ensure sustainability.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Each round, assess the stock's condition and others' actions.
   - Use a weighted average of recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds) to determine the cooperation/defection rate.
   - If the cooperation rate is high and the stock remains robust, continue Defecting. If not, switch back to Cooperate.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Gradually increase defecting but remain cautious to prevent stock crashes that reduce future payoffs.

6. **Forward-Looking Calculations:**
   - Estimate the impact of current actions on future stock levels and payoffs.
   - Balance immediate gains against potential long-term losses from stock depletion.

7. **Sustainability Check:**
   - Maintain a moderate stock level to leverage growth dynamics, ensuring that the stock can recover if necessary without over-depletion.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, allowing for adaptive responses to others' behaviors while preserving opportunities for future payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_358 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reasoning: Start by cooperating to build a cooperative image and observe opponents' behavior without immediately exploiting them.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Decision Rule Based on Stock Level:**
     - If the stock is above 75% of capacity:
       - Action: Defect (D)
         - Reasoning: Exploit the cooperation of others by defecting to gain a higher payoff since the resource is abundant.
     - If the stock is below 25% of capacity:
       - Action: Cooperate (C)
         - Reasoning: Prevent further depletion to ensure some resource remains for future rounds, avoiding collapse.

3. **Adaptive Behavior Based on Opponents' Actions:**
   - Monitor opponents' choices in previous rounds.
     - If a majority are defecting:
       - Shift towards cooperation (C) to encourage stock replenishment and prevent rapid depletion.
     - If most are cooperating:
       - Continue defecting (D) to maximize personal gain.

4. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Reasoning: In the final rounds, exploit the resource without concern for future sustainability since there's no long-term impact.

**Edge Cases and Adjustments:**

- **Stock Near Capacity:** If the stock is near capacity in middle rounds, defect to take advantage of others' cooperation.
- **Sudden Stock Depletion:** If stock drops rapidly due to widespread defection, switch back to cooperate (C) to aid recovery and ensure future payoffs.

**Summary:**
This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability by initially cooperating, defecting when advantageous, and adapting based on opponents' behavior. It ensures maximum personal gain while maintaining the resource for longer-term benefits.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy is designed to exploit opponents effectively while maintaining the common pool resource for sustainable exploitation. The approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Cooperate (C)**: When the stock level is low (below a dynamically adjusted threshold) or when opponents are likely to cooperate.
- **Defect (D)**: When the stock is high, opponents are defecting, or in the final rounds where long-term consequences are irrelevant.

### 2. Strategy Implementation:

#### a. Initial Rounds:
- **First Round**: Defect to test opponents' reactions and gauge their initial behavior.

#### b. Subsequent Rounds:
1. **Stock Check**:
   - Calculate the current stock level.
   - Determine if it's above or below a dynamically adjusted threshold (initially set at 60% of capacity).

2. **Opponent Behavior Analysis**:
   - Track the recent defection rate among opponents using a moving average over the last few rounds.
   - If most opponents are defecting, continue to defect to exploit their behavior.
   - If many are cooperating, defect to gain more while maintaining the resource.

3. **Threshold Adjustment**:
   - Decrease the threshold slightly each round as the game progresses, encouraging cooperation towards the end to maintain resource health.

4. **Immediate Exploitation**:
   - When stock is above the threshold and opponents are defecting, exploit by defecting.
   - If opponents cooperate, defect to maximize gains without over-depleting the resource.

#### c. Mid-Game Adjustment:
- Monitor the average stock level over recent rounds. If it's decreasing significantly, shift towards more cooperation to prevent collapse.

#### d. Endgame Exploitation:
- In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%), switch to always defecting since there are no future payoffs to consider.

### 3. Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round**: Always defect to test opponents.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Cooperate to allow regrowth and maintain resource health for future exploitation.
- **Endgame**: Defect in the final rounds regardless of stock level.

### 4. Adaptation Mechanism:
- If after initial defection, opponents start cooperating more than expected, adjust by cooperating temporarily to encourage them to continue cooperating, then exploit again when the stock recovers.

### Summary:
This strategy is exploitative and adaptive, designed to maximize immediate gains while preserving the resource for future exploitation. It dynamically adjusts based on stock levels and opponent behavior, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.

### Strategy Name: Exploitative Adaptive Defector (EAD)

The EAD strategy is designed to exploit the cooperative tendencies of other players while maintaining adaptability to different opponent behaviors and game states.

---

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Exploration Phase**:
   - In the first round, always Cooperate (C) to encourage others to reveal their strategies.
   - Observe the actions of other players in the first few rounds to identify potential cooperators.

2. **Exploitation Phase**:
   - If at least 50% of players are Cooperating (based on historical data), Defect (D). Exploit the cooperative behavior for higher immediate payoff.
   - If fewer than 50% of players are Cooperating, Cooperate to maintain a sustainable stock level and encourage others to Cooperate.

3. **Stock-Based Adjustment**:
   - Calculate the Stock Threshold (ST) = capacity × 0.75.
     - If current stock ≤ ST: Cooperate to prevent rapid depletion.
     - If current stock > ST: Defect, as high stock levels allow for exploitation without immediate risk of collapse.

4. **Endgame Adjustment**:
   - In the last 10% of rounds (rounded up), switch to always Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff regardless of other factors.

---

### Pseudocode:

```python
def EAD_strategy(round_number, n, r, capacity, stock_history, opponent_actions):
    # Initial Exploration Phase: Cooperate in the first round
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate historical cooperation rate among opponents
    total_opponent_coops = sum([action == 'C' for actions in opponent_actions.values() for action in actions])
    total_opponent_moves = sum([len(actions) for actions in opponent_actions.values()])
    if total_opponent_moves > 0:
        coop_rate = total_opponent_coops / total_opponent_moves
    else:
        coop_rate = 0.5  # Default to middle ground
    
    # Stock Threshold calculation

        return 'C'
    elif coop_rate >= 0.5:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

---

### Edge Cases:

- **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C) to encourage others to reveal their strategies.
- **Last 10% of Rounds**: Switch to always Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff, regardless of other factors.
- **Low Stock Levels** (stock ≤ ST): Prioritize Cooperation (C) to prevent rapid depletion and ensure long-term sustainability.

---

### Exploitative Mindset:

The EAD strategy exploits the following tendencies:
1. Players who Cooperate consistently provide an opportunity for higher payoffs through Defection.
2. High stock levels allow for exploitation without immediate risk of resource collapse.
3. In the final rounds, defecting maximizes short-term gains when there is no future payoff to lose.

By adapting to both opponent behavior and game state, EAD balances exploitation with sustainability to maximize long-term payoff while remaining robust to different opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_362 = '''
To address the problem, we developed a strategy that balances exploiting other players' cooperation with maintaining the resource's sustainability. The approach involves monitoring others' actions and the current stock level to decide when to defect or cooperate.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Set thresholds for others' cooperation rate (e.g., 60%) and stock level relative to capacity (e.g., 75%).

2. **Each Round**:
   a. Calculate the current stock as a percentage of capacity.
   b. Compute other players' recent cooperation rate (e.g., over the last few rounds).
   c. If the stock is above 75% and others are cooperating sufficiently, defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   d. Otherwise, cooperate to help sustain the resource.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - Periodically adjust thresholds based on how well the stock is sustained.
   - In later rounds, prioritize cooperation to ensure enough recovery time.

### Solution Code
Here's a Python implementation of the strategy:

```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.round = 0
        self.coop_history = []  # Track other players' cooperation rates
        self.capacity = None
        self.n = None

    def set_game_parameters(self, n, capacity):
        self.n = n
        self.capacity = capacity

    def get_action(self, current_stock, others_actions_prev_round):
        self.round += 1

        # Update history of other players' cooperation
        if others_actions_prev_round:
            recent_coop_rate = sum(others_actions_prev_round) / len(others_actions_prev_round)
            self.coop_history.append(recent_coop_rate)
            # Keep only the last few rounds for moving window (e.g., 5 rounds)
            if len(self.coop_history) > 5:
                self.coop_history.pop(0)

        # Determine thresholds
        stock_pct = current_stock / self.capacity * 100
        min_coop_threshold = 60.0  # Example threshold

        # Calculate recent average cooperation rate
        if len(self.coop_history) > 0:
            avg_coop_rate = sum(self.coop_history) / len(self.coop_history)
        else:
            avg_coop_rate = 100.0  # Initially assume others are cooperative

        # Conditions for defecting
        def defect_condition():
            if stock_pct >= 75 and (avg_coop_rate >= min_coop_threshold):
                return True
            return False

        # Consider later rounds: prioritize cooperation near the end
        total_rounds = ...  # Assume known or estimate based on game progression
        late_game_threshold = 0.9 * total_rounds
        if self.round > late_game_threshold:
            return 'Cooperate'

        if defect_condition():
            action = 'Defect'
        else:
            action = 'Cooperate'

        return action
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: Sets up thresholds for others' cooperation and stock level.
- **Each Round**: Monitors current stock and recent cooperation rates of other players to decide the action.
- **Adjustments**: Adjusts strategy in later rounds to ensure sustainable exploitation.

This approach ensures that we maximize our payoff while managing resource sustainability effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_363 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a strategic approach that balances cooperation with exploitation based on the current state of the resource and the observed behavior of other players. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set an initial threshold `T` at 70% of the capacity (`0.7 * capacity`).
   - Define a sensitivity point where if more than half of the players defect in a round, you will switch to defecting as well.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**:
   - Gradually lower the threshold `T` each round (e.g., by 2% of the capacity) to encourage more defection towards the end of the game.
   - Ensure that the threshold does not drop below a minimum, such as 50% of the capacity.

3. **Behavioral Observation**:
   - Each round, observe the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - If more than half of the players defected last round, switch to defecting this round regardless of the stock level (unless the stock is extremely high).

4. **Cooperation Check**:
   - Cooperate if the current stock level exceeds the threshold `T` and less than half of the players defected in the previous round.
   - Otherwise, defect.

5. **Endgame Exploitation**:
   - In the final 10% of rounds, always defect to maximize immediate gains since there's no future payoff beyond these rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, num_players, last_round_defectors_count, current_round, total_rounds):
    # Initialize threshold and minimum threshold
    T = 0.7 * capacity
    min_T = 0.5 * capacity
    decay_rate = 0.02  # 2% of capacity per round
    
    # Calculate the remaining rounds
    remaining_rounds = total_rounds - current_round + 1
    
    # Apply threshold decay based on remaining rounds
    if current_round > 1:
        T -= decay_rate * capacity
        T = max(T, min_T)
    
    # Check for endgame exploitation (last 10% of rounds)
    if remaining_rounds <= total_rounds / 10:
        return 'Defect'
    
    # Determine last round's defector proportion
    last_defectors_proportion = last_round_defectors_count / num_players
    
    # Decision logic
    if current_stock > T and last_defectors_proportion < 0.5:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'

# Example usage:
capacity = 100
num_players = 4
total_rounds = 20

for round in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    # Assume current_stock and last_round_defectors_count are known from previous state
    current_stock = ...  # Obtain actual value
    last_round_defectors_count = ...  # Obtain actual count
    
    action = decide_action(current_stock, capacity, num_players, last_round_defectors_count, round, total_rounds)
    print(f"Round {round}: Action is to {action}")
```

- **Threshold Adjustment**: The threshold `T` starts at 70% of the capacity and decreases by a small amount each round, encouraging more defection as the game progresses.
- **Behavioral Sensitivity**: By observing the proportion of defectors in the previous round, the strategy adapts to others' actions. If more than half defect, it signals a shift towards exploitation.
- **Endgame Strategy**: In the final 10% of rounds, defecting maximizes immediate gains since future payoffs are negligible.

This approach ensures a balance between sustaining the resource through cooperation when beneficial and exploiting opportunities when others fail to cooperate, optimized for different stages of the game.

To address the problem of maximizing immediate payoffs while considering the impact on future rounds, an AI can adopt a strategic approach that balances exploitation and sustainability. Here's a structured decision-making process:

### Decision Rules for Exploitative Strategy

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Starting with cooperation helps sustain the resource initially, allowing higher payoffs in subsequent rounds if others also cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **High Stock Levels (Current stock > 70% of capacity):**
      - **Action:** Defect
        - Exploit the high stock by defecting to gain maximum immediate payoff.
   
   b. **Moderate Stock Levels (40% ≤ Current stock ≤ 70%):**
      - **Action:** Mirror the majority action from the previous round
        - If others cooperated more, defect; if they defected, cooperate to balance exploitation and sustainability.

   c. **Low Stock Levels (Current stock < 40%):**
      - **Action:** Cooperate
        - Help sustain the resource by cooperating, allowing recovery for future exploitation.

3. **Endgame (Last 2 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Exploit whatever remains without concern for future rounds since they are nearing conclusion.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust thresholds based on observed stock trends and others' actions to optimize payoff.
- **Trend Analysis:** Track whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable over recent rounds to inform decisions.
- **Adaptability:** Flexibly switch strategies in response to changing conditions to maximize immediate gains while preserving resources for future use.

This approach allows the AI to exploit opportunities effectively while managing long-term sustainability to continue exploiting in subsequent rounds.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_365 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' strategies while managing resource depletion risks.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start cautiously to observe others' initial moves without contributing to immediate resource depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Level and Opponents' Actions:**
     - If most players Cooperated last round and the stock is high:
       - **Action:** Defect (D) with higher probability to exploit the situation for a larger payoff.
     - If many Defected, leading to significant stock drop:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C) to aid resource recovery.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds or retaliation.

**Adaptability and Monitoring:**

- **Opponents' Strategies:** Adjust based on others' actions. Exploit consistent Cooperators by defecting more, while balancing to avoid crashes if others retaliate.
- **Stock Dynamics:** Pay attention to resource recovery; maintain a balance between defection for payoff and cooperation to prevent depletion.

**Risk Management:**

- Avoid over-defecting when stock is low to prevent crashes that reduce future payoffs.
- Be responsive to changes in stock levels and opponents' strategies, adjusting actions accordingly to exploit opportunities while mitigating risks.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, allowing maximization of payoff while adapting to the game's dynamics and opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_366 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing payoffs in a multi-player game where players can Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), an effective strategy involves balancing short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Exploitation**: Begin by choosing to Defect (D). This action allows the AI to gain higher immediate payoffs, assuming other players are Cooperating (C).

2. **Monitor Behavior**: Track the number of Defectors in each round. If a significant proportion (e.g., over 50%) of players start defecting, it indicates potential resource depletion.

3. **Switch to Cooperation**: Once the number of Defectors exceeds the threshold, switch to Cooperating (C). This helps maintain the shared resource and prevents mutual depletion, ensuring sustainable payoffs in future rounds.

4. **Adapt as Needed**: Continue monitoring the proportion of Defectors. If it drops below the threshold, revert to defecting to exploit others' cooperation again.

By following this strategy, the AI maximizes immediate gains while adapting to maintain long-term sustainability based on others' actions.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting cooperative opponents while preventing resource collapse, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and opponent behaviors.

---

### **Decision Rules: When to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D)**

1. **Initial Exploration (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning:** Build trust and observe opponents' initial strategies without significant impact on the stock.

2. **Assess Opponent Behavior:**
   - Track opponents' actions in previous rounds to determine if they are mostly Cooperating (C) or Defecting (D).

3. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - **High Stock (S > 0.8 * capacity):**
     - If opponents are Cooperating, defect for higher payoff.
     - If opponents are defecting, consider defecting if immediate gain outweighs future risks.

   - **Moderate Stock (0.5 * capacity ≤ S ≤ 0.8 * capacity):**
     - Balance between exploiting cooperation and preventing collapse. Consider defecting if opponents cooperate but be cautious with stock levels.

   - **Low Stock (S < 0.5 * capacity):**
     - Cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow stock recovery.

4. **Proportion of Cooperators:**
   - If >60% of opponents are Cooperating, defect.
   - If ≤60% are Cooperating, cooperate to avoid rapid resource depletion.

5. **Dynamic Switching:**
   - Adjust strategy based on opponent behavior changes and stock trends.
   - Example: Shift from D to C if opponents start defecting more and stock is decreasing.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate to observe opponents' initial strategies without significant impact.

2. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Defect regardless of previous actions, as there's no future consequence.

3. **Stock Collapse Risk:**
   - If stock is critically low (S < 0.3 * capacity), prioritize cooperation to allow recovery.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, round_number):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    capacity = initial_capacity

    # Initial Exploration: Cooperate in first few rounds
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'

    # Assess opponent behavior from history
    cooperator_proportion = calculate_cooperator_proportion(history)

    # Determine stock level threshold
    if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity:
        if cooperator_proportion > 0.6:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif 0.5 * capacity <= current_stock <= 0.8 * capacity:
        if cooperator_proportion > 0.6 and round_number != r:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    else:  # Low stock
        return 'C'

def calculate_cooperator_proportion(history):
    total = len(history) * n
    cooperators = sum(1 for action in history if action == 'C')
    return cooperators / total
```

---

### **Summary**

This strategy balances exploitation of cooperative opponents with the need to prevent resource collapse. By dynamically adapting based on opponent behavior and stock levels, it maximizes short-term gains while ensuring long-term sustainability when necessary. Handling edge cases like initial rounds and the final round ensures robustness across different game scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_368 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a dynamic approach that adapts to both opponents' actions and the state of the resource. The goal is to maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' behavior while ensuring adaptability to changing conditions.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Phase (First 3 Rounds):** Cooperate to maintain the resource and observe others' strategies.
2. **Middle Phase (Rounds 4 to r-3):** Monitor the number of Defectors and stock level each round. Switch to Defecting if:
   - More than half of players Defect in any round, or
   - Stock falls below a threshold (e.g., 70% capacity).
3. **Final Phase (Last 3 Rounds):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoffs.
4. **Adaptation:** After switching to Defecting, check if conditions improve (fewer Defectors and higher stock) for two consecutive rounds. If so, switch back to Cooperating.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - For the first three rounds, always Cooperate to build trust and maintain resource levels.

2. **Monitoring and Switching:**
   - From round 4 onwards, in each round:
     a. Count Defectors; if over 50%, switch to Defect.
     b. Check stock level; if below 70% capacity, switch to Defect.

3. **Persistent Defection:**
   - Once switched to Defecting, continue until the end unless conditions improve significantly.

4. **Reversion to Cooperation (Optional):**
   - If, after switching to Defect, two consecutive rounds show fewer Defectors and higher stock, revert to Cooperate.

### Edge Cases

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **High Stock Levels:** Continue Cooperating if others are also doing so.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Start Defecting to exploit the situation before resource depletion.
- **Final Rounds:** Always Defect as future payoffs are limited.

This strategy balances exploitation with adaptability, ensuring short-term gains while considering long-term sustainability when beneficial.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_369 = '''
To address the problem, we developed a strategic approach that balances short-term exploitation with long-term preservation of resources. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Exploitation**: Start by defecting in the first round to gain higher immediate payoffs.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - For subsequent rounds (from 2 to r-1), evaluate the current stock level.
   - If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), continue defecting to exploit the resource.
   - If the stock is below this threshold, switch to cooperating to help preserve the resource and allow it to recover.

3. **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment**:
   - Track the proportion of defects in recent rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds).
   - If the defect rate exceeds a predefined percentage (e.g., 50%), lower the threshold to encourage more cooperation, recognizing that others' actions are threatening future sustainability.
   - Maintain or slightly increase the threshold if defect rates are low and stock levels remain stable.

4. **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last round, defect regardless of the stock level since there's no impact on future rounds.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to defect when the current stock is above 70% of capacity or in the first three rounds, and switch to cooperating when the stock drops below this threshold or if a high proportion of other players are defecting. This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, maximizing total payoff.

\boxed{\text{Defect when stock >70%, else Cooperate; adjust based on others' defects}}

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' cooperative tendencies while preserving the resource when necessary.

---

### **Decision Rules:**
1. **Current Stock Assessment:** Evaluate the current stock level relative to capacity thresholds (high > 75%, low < 25%).
2. **Predict Others' Actions:** Analyze past actions of other players to predict their likely moves.
3. **Adaptive Action Selection:**
   - **High Stock (>75%):** Defect if others are likely to cooperate, exploiting their behavior for higher payoff.
   - **Low Stock (<25%):** Cooperate to preserve the resource and avoid collapse.
   - **Medium Stock (25%-75%):** Balance based on predicted actions; defect if others are expected to defect, else cooperate.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**
1. **First Round:** Default to Defect to test others' responses and gain immediate payoff.
2. **Last 10% Rounds:** Defect maximally as future payoffs are irrelevant, focusing on immediate gains.

                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

---

### **Summary:**
This strategy exploits others' cooperative tendencies when the stock is high and defects cautiously in medium or low stock scenarios to preserve resources. It adapts dynamically based on historical data, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_371 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Exploitation**

1. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - Establish two thresholds: a cooperation threshold (Coop_Thresh) and a defect threshold (Defect_Thresh). These thresholds adjust based on the number of rounds remaining, current stock levels, and opponents' actions.
   - Coop_Thresh = max(capacity * 0.25, capacity - r * (capacity / 10))
   - Defect_Thresh = max(capacity * 0.75, capacity - r * (capacity / 20))

2. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - Current stock ≤ Coop_Thresh
     - More than 60% of opponents defected in the last round
   - **Defect** otherwise.

3. **Adaptation Mechanism**:
   - After each round, update thresholds based on stock dynamics and opponents' actions.
   - If more players defect, increase Coop_Thresh to encourage preservation.
   - If cooperation is observed, lower Defect_Thresh to exploit opportunities.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to assess opponents' strategies.
   - **Last Few Rounds (≤ 5 rounds)**: Prioritize cooperation to sustain stock and ensure steady payoffs.

5. **Pseudocode Summary**:

```pseudocode
function decide_action(round, stock, history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    r = total_rounds

    # Calculate thresholds based on remaining rounds and stock level
    remaining_rounds = r - round + 1
    Coop_Thresh = max(capacity * 0.25, capacity - (remaining_rounds) * (capacity / 10))
    Defect_Thresh = max(capacity * 0.75, capacity - (remaining_rounds) * (capacity / 20))

    # Determine opponents' recent behavior
    last_round_actions = history[round-1]
    num_defectors_last_round = sum(action == 'D' for action in last_round_actions.values())

    # Decision rules

        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Update thresholds dynamically based on game progression and opponent behavior
```

This strategy balances exploitation with preservation by dynamically adjusting cooperation and defect thresholds, ensuring adaptability to diverse opponent behaviors and game dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_372 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategic approach that balances exploitation and sustainability in repeated interactions. The solution involves making decisions based on observed behaviors of other players and the current state of the shared resource. Here's a structured breakdown of the strategy:

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - This initial move allows observation of others' behavior without risking early depletion.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step A:** Calculate the cooperation rate (`C_prev`) from the previous round, i.e., the proportion of players who cooperated.
   - **Step B:** Check the current stock level (`S`).
   - **Decision:**
     - If `C_prev > 50%` OR `S > 80%` of the capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - Exploit others' cooperation while ensuring the resource can recover due to high stock levels.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - Maintain or rebuild the resource when exploitation might lead to unsustainable depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact on subsequent rounds.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Establishes a baseline for observing others without early risk of depleting the resource.
  
- **Exploitation When Possible:** By defecting when others cooperate, especially with high stock levels, you maximize personal gain while relying on others to sustain the resource through cooperation.

- **Sustainability Consideration:** Cooperating when necessary prevents over-depletion, ensuring the resource remains viable for future rounds and maintaining a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

### Example Scenarios:

1. **All Players Cooperate Initially:**
   - Round 1: You cooperate.
   - Round 2: High cooperation observed; you defect to exploit.
   - Subsequent Rounds: If others start defecting, you may switch back to cooperating to rebuild the resource.

2. **Half Cooperate, Half Defect Each Round:**
   - Maintain a balance by defecting when stock is high and cooperating otherwise, ensuring both exploitation and sustainability.

### Conclusion:

This strategy effectively navigates the trade-off between exploiting others' cooperation for immediate gain and ensuring the resource's sustainability for future rounds. By adapting to observed behaviors and current conditions, it balances short-term exploitation with long-term strategic interests.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate in the first round, defect when more than half of players cooperated or the stock is high in subsequent rounds, and always defect in the last round for maximum payoff. This approach balances exploitation with sustainability.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; defect if others mostly cooperate or stock is high; always defect last round.}}

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to observe opponents' initial strategies and assess the stock's behavior.
   - **Last Round (r):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future rounds to consider.
   - **Intermediate Rounds (2 ≤ t < r):**
     a. Calculate the current stock level \( S \).
     b. Determine if \( S \) is above or below a dynamically adjusted threshold \( T \).
     c. If \( S > T \), defect to exploit the higher payoff opportunity while ensuring sufficient growth for future rounds.
     d. If \( S ≤ T \), cooperate to preserve the resource and avoid rapid depletion, which could reduce future payoffs.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Start with an initial threshold \( T_0 = 0.8 \times \text{capacity} \).
   - After each round, adjust \( T \) based on observed stock growth:
     - If the stock recovered significantly (high growth), slightly increase \( T \) (e.g., by 5% of capacity).
     - If the stock is depleting quickly or not recovering well, decrease \( T \) to encourage cooperation.

3. **Opponent Behavior Exploitation:**
   - Monitor the number of defectors in each round.
   - If a majority cooperate, exploit by defecting to gain a larger share.
   - If many defect, switch to cooperating to prevent stock collapse and ensure sustainability for future rounds.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to gather information on opponents' strategies without risking immediate depletion.
   - **Last Round:** Defect aggressively to maximize payoff since there's no need to preserve the resource.
   - **High Stock (near capacity):** Safely defect as growth can replenish consumed resources.
   - **Low Stock (below \( T \)):** Cooperate to prevent further depletion and ensure some stock remains for potential future exploitation.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def strategy(history, current_round, stock_level, n, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate dynamic threshold T
        T = calculate_threshold(history)
        
        if stock_level > T:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def calculate_threshold(history):
    initial_T = 0.8 * capacity
    T = initial_T
    
    for round_data in history[:-1]:  # Exclude current round
        S_remaining, growth = get_stock_dynamics(round_data)
        if growth > expected_growth(S_remaining, capacity):
            T += 0.05 * capacity
        else:
            T -= 0.05 * capacity
    
    return max(min(T, capacity), 2*n)  # Ensure T is within valid range

def get_stock_dynamics(round_data):
    S = round_data['stock']
    consumption = sum(round_data['actions'])
    S_remaining = S - consumption
    growth = 2 * S_remaining * (1 - S_remaining/capacity)
    return S_remaining, growth

def expected_growth(S_remaining, capacity):
    return 2 * S_remaining * (1 - S_remaining/capacity)
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy begins by Cooperating in the first round to gather information.
- In intermediate rounds, it defects if the stock is above a dynamically adjusted threshold \( T \), ensuring immediate gains while allowing for replenishment. Below \( T \), it cooperates to preserve the resource.
- The threshold \( T \) adjusts based on observed growth, encouraging more defection when recovery is robust and cooperation when depletion risks are high.
- In the final round, defecting maximizes payoff without concern for future rounds.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to exploit opponents' behaviors while preserving resources when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_374 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Strategy:**

The optimal strategy involves balancing immediate gains from defecting with the need to sustain the resource for future rounds, adapting based on current stock levels, round number, and opponents' behavior.

1. **Early Rounds (First 30% of Total Rounds):**
   - **High Stock (≥90% Capacity):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Moderate Stock (70%-90%):** If more than 50% of players defected in the last round, cooperate to prevent resource collapse. Otherwise, defect.
   - **Low Stock (<70%):** Cooperate to preserve what's left.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 40% of Total Rounds):**
   - **High Stock (≥80% Capacity):** Defect if opponents are not heavily defecting.
   - **Moderate Stock (60%-80%):** If more than 50% defected last round, cooperate; else, defect.
   - **Low Stock (<60%):** Cooperate to avoid further depletion.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 30% of Total Rounds):**
   - Always Cooperate to maintain the resource for critical final rounds where growth can still help replenish it.

4. **Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Track the proportion of players defecting each round.
   - If >60% defected in recent rounds, switch to cooperation earlier to prevent collapse.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Start with D if stock is high and n is small (e.g., n=4).
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Consider defecting again to maximize payoff since future rounds don't exist; however, balance this to avoid total resource collapse in these final rounds.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to initially defect when the resource stock is high and adapt based on opponents' behavior and round progression. Cooperate more as the game nears its end to sustain the resource for critical final rounds. Specifically:

- **Early Rounds (First 30%):** Defect if stock ≥90%; cooperate otherwise, adjusting based on opponents.
- **Middle Rounds:** Balance between defecting at high stock and cooperating when needed.
- **Late Rounds (Last 30%):** Always Cooperate.

Thus, the strategy is:

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that maximizes immediate payoff while considering long-term resource sustainability, follow these steps:

### Strategy Overview

The strategy balances exploitation of others' cooperation with preservation of the common pool. It adapts based on observed behavior and stock levels, ensuring maximum payoff without causing irreversible resource depletion.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - Cooperate to observe others' strategies and maintain a stable resource level.
   - Example: In early rounds, default to C to build a history of cooperation.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Use a dynamic threshold based on the current stock level (S_remaining) after consumption:
     - If S_remaining > Threshold(t), Cooperate.
     - Else, Defect.
   - Adjust the Threshold dynamically as the game progresses:
     - Start with a higher threshold in early rounds and decrease it over time to encourage defecting in later stages.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 10%):**
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's limited time for resource recovery.

4. **Adaptation Based on Others' Behavior:**
   - Track the proportion of Cooperates (C) and Defects (D) from other players.
   - If a high proportion of Cs are observed, exploit by defecting when possible to gain higher payoff while others maintain the resource.
   - If many Ds are observed, adjust your strategy to prevent further depletion that could hurt future payoffs.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to avoid early aggressive depletion and observe others' actions.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10%):** Defect consistently to maximize immediate gain without worrying about long-term effects.

### Pseudocode Implementation

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** By cooperating initially, the strategy avoids early depletion and observes others' strategies to exploit them later.
- **Dynamic Threshold:** The threshold for cooperation decreases over time, encouraging more defecting as the game progresses. This ensures that in later rounds, the strategy prioritizes immediate payoff.
- **Adaptation:** Monitoring others' actions allows adjustment of behavior. If many defect, it signals a competitive environment, prompting increased defection to maximize gains.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Cooperating first round and defecting in the last few rounds optimally balances resource preservation with payoff maximization.

This strategy effectively exploits cooperative players while adapting to competitive environments, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_377 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing payoffs while balancing resource exploitation and preservation, we developed a strategic approach that adapts to current conditions and opponent behavior. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the strategy:

1. **Initial Move**: Defect in the first round to test opponents' initial behavior and exploit any cooperators.

2. **Last Round**: Always defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

3. **Intermediate Rounds**:
   - **Resource Preservation**: If the current stock is below 30% of capacity, switch to cooperating to allow resource recovery.
   - **Exploitation Based on Opponent Behavior**:
     - Track opponents' defect rates over recent rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds).
     - If the defect rate among opponents exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%), continue defecting to exploit their aggressive strategy.
     - If the defect rate is moderate (30%-60%), consider a mix of defecting and cooperating based on observed behavior and stock levels.
     - If the defect rate drops below 30%, switch to defecting more aggressively to exploit opponents who are likely cooperating.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation**: After each round, update the stock level and adjust future decisions based on changes in resource availability and shifts in opponents' strategies.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to both current conditions and observed opponent behavior, ensuring optimal exploitation of resources while preserving them when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_378 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts to opponent behavior while maximizing personal payoff, we can follow these steps:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy focuses on exploiting others' cooperation when possible and switches to cooperation only when necessary to prevent resource collapse. It uses observations of past actions and current stock levels to decide each round's action.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

#### **First Round:**
- **Action:** Defect (D)
  - Rationale: Exploit potential cooperators by defecting first, aiming for higher immediate payoff.

#### **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
- **Calculate the proportion of players who defected in the previous round.**
  - If this proportion is below a threshold (e.g., 50%) **AND** the current stock level is above a certain percentage of capacity (e.g., 60%):
    - **Action:** Defect (D)
      - Rationale: Exploit others' cooperation while ensuring sustainable resource levels for future exploitation.
  - Else:
    - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
      - Rationale: Prevent over-depletion to sustain the resource, allowing continued exploitation in future rounds.

#### **Last Round (r):**
- **Action:** Defect (D)
  - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

#### **First Round:**
- Default action is D to exploit potential cooperators, despite the risk of stock depletion if others also defect.

#### **Last Round:**
- Unconditionally choose D to maximize personal gain with no regard for resource preservation.

#### **Stock Management:**
- If in middle rounds, observe high defects and low stock levels:
  - Switch to C temporarily to allow regrowth, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.

---

### Example Decision Process:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Action: D
   - Reason: Exploit potential cooperators.

2. **Round 2:**
   - Observe that 40% of players defected last round.
   - Current stock is at 70% of capacity.
     - Since defects are below 50% and stock is above 60%, choose D.

3. **Round 3:**
   - Defects in Round 2 were 60%.
   - Stock is now at 40%.
     - Since defects exceed threshold or stock is low, switch to C.

---

### Conclusion:
This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting based on observed behavior and resource levels. It maximizes immediate gains while ensuring future opportunities by preventing total resource collapse.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate (C) when:
     - The current stock is low (<40% of capacity).
     - Other players have a low cooperation rate (<30% in recent rounds).
     - In the first few rounds to set a baseline.
   - Defect (D) when:
     - The current stock is high (>60% of capacity).
     - Other players have a high cooperation rate (>50% in recent rounds).
     - In later rounds, especially approaching the end.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to build a sustainable base.
   - **Last Round (Round r):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff with no future impact.

3. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Track other players' actions over the last 10 rounds.
   - Calculate an average cooperation rate among others.
   - Use thresholds (50% for high, 30% for low) to decide between C and D based on their cooperation trends.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def choose_action(current_stock, capacity, history, t, r):

    cooperation_threshold = 0.5
    low_coop_threshold = 0.3

            return 'D'

# Edge Cases
if t == 1:
    return 'C'
elif t == r:
    return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
This strategy dynamically adapts by exploiting others' cooperation when beneficial and cooperating to sustain the resource when necessary. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_380 = '''
To address the problem, we can devise a strategy where each player dynamically adjusts their action (Cooperate or Defect) based on the current stock level relative to a threshold. This threshold decreases as the game progresses, encouraging cooperation when the stock is low to facilitate recovery.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Threshold Calculation**: For each round t (from 1 to r), compute a dynamic threshold T_t which is inversely proportional to the number of remaining rounds. The formula used is:
   
   \[
   T_t = \left(\frac{r - t + 1}{r}\right) \times \text{capacity}
   \]
   
   This ensures that in earlier rounds, a higher stock is required to defect, while in later rounds, the threshold decreases, promoting cooperation as the game nears its end.

2. **Action Decision**: In each round, compare the current stock level S with T_t:
   
   - If \( S \geq T_t \): Choose to Defect, exploiting the high stock for immediate payoff.
   - Else: Choose to Cooperate, helping maintain or recover the stock for future exploitation.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - In the final round (t = r), always Defect since there are no future rounds to consider.
   - If at any point S drops significantly below capacity, cooperation becomes crucial to prevent the stock from collapsing, which would reduce payoffs in subsequent rounds.

**Example:**

Consider a scenario with 4 players and a total of 10 rounds (r=10). Let's evaluate how the strategy unfolds:

- **Round 1**: 
  - \( T_1 = \left(\frac{10 - 1 + 1}{10}\right) \times 100 = 100 \)
  - Since S=100 ≥ T_t, players defect. Total consumption is higher than if all cooperated, but the stock may recover in subsequent rounds.

- **Round 5**:
  - \( T_5 = \left(\frac{10 - 5 + 1}{10}\right) \times 100 = 60 \)
  - If S is above 60, defect; otherwise, cooperate. This balance helps sustain the stock.

- **Round 10**:
  - \( T_{10} = \left(\frac{10 - 10 + 1}{10}\right) \times 100 = 10 \)
  - Regardless of S, defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff.

This strategy promotes a balance between exploiting current resources and preserving them for future rounds, adapting dynamically based on the game's progression.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_381 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting others' cooperative behavior with maintaining sustainable stock levels. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Exploitation**: Start by defecting to exploit cooperators and gain higher immediate payoffs.

2. **Stock Monitoring**: Track the stock level after each round. If it falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to cooperation to allow recovery.

3. **Adaptive Behavior**:
   - **Cooperate** if the stock is low or if most players are defecting.
   - **Defect** when many players cooperate, exploiting their behavior for higher payoffs.

4. **Thresholds and Adjustments**: Use thresholds based on stock levels and player actions to decide between cooperation and defection.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Defect to maximize immediate gains.
   - **Last Round**: Unconditionally defect as there are no future rounds.

### Detailed Strategy

1. **Initial Rounds (Defection)**:
   - In the first round, defect to exploit cooperators and gain higher payoffs.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**:
   - After each round, check if the stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity). If below, prioritize cooperation to prevent resource collapse.

3. **Adapt Based on Player Actions**:
   - Track the number of cooperators and defectors in previous rounds.
   - If a significant proportion of players cooperate, defect to exploit their behavior.
   - If most defect, switch to cooperation to sustain the resource.

4. **Thresholds for Actions**:
   - Use a threshold (e.g., 50% capacity) to decide between defecting and cooperating.
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on observed player behavior and stock growth patterns.

5. **Last Round Adjustment**:
   - In the final round, defect unconditionally to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
def strategy(stock_level, history):
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    cooperation_threshold = 0.3  # 30% of players cooperating
    
    if t == 1:
        return D
    else:
        num_coop = count(history, 'C')
        
        if stock_level > threshold and (num_coop / n) > cooperation_threshold:
            return D
        else:
            return C

# In the last round
if t == r:
    return D
```

### Conclusion

This strategy exploits others' cooperation when beneficial while ensuring sustainable resource management. By adapting to player actions and stock levels, it maximizes payoffs while mitigating risks of resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_382 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing payoff while balancing resource depletion, we employ a strategic approach that combines exploiting others' cooperation with maintaining a sustainable resource level. The strategy is designed to adapt based on the observed behavior of other players and the current state of the resource.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to set a non-aggressive tone and observe others' actions.
2. **Exploit When Safe**: In subsequent rounds, if enough players cooperated in the previous round and the current resource level is sufficiently high, defect to exploit their cooperation for higher immediate payoff.
3. **Maintain Resource Sustainability**: If too few players cooperate or the resource level is low, continue cooperating to help maintain or rebuild the resource for future sustainability.
4. **Final Round Exploitation**: Always defect in the last round to maximize payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(history, memory):
    import numpy as np
    
    if not history:
        return 'cooperate', None
    
    n = len(history)  # Total players including self
    rounds_played = len(history[0])  # Number of rounds played so far
    
    current_round = rounds_played - 1  # Indexing from 0
    total_rounds = ...  # Assume this is known or adjust accordingly

    if current_round == total_rounds - 1:
        return 'defect', None
    
    previous_cooperators = sum(1 for player_history in history if len(player_history) > 0 and player_history[-1] == 'cooperate')
    
    X = 0.6 * n
    Y = 0.8 * capacity  # Assuming capacity is known, adjust as needed
    
    current_stock = ...  # Obtain from game state, adjust accordingly

    if previous_cooperators > X and current_stock > Y:
        return 'defect', None
    else:
        return 'cooperate', None
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to cooperate and gather information about their behavior.
- **Exploitation Check**: For each subsequent round (excluding the last), the strategy checks if more than a threshold percentage of players cooperated in the previous round and whether the current resource level is sufficiently high. If both conditions are met, it defects to exploit the cooperative behavior for higher payoff.
- **Sustainability Check**: If fewer players cooperate or the resource level is low, the strategy continues to cooperate to help maintain or rebuild the resource, ensuring sustainability for future rounds.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: In the final round, the strategy defects unconditionally to maximize the immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior and current conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_383 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation with conservation without complete information about others' actions, the following strategy is proposed:

1. **Initial Exploitation**: Begin by defecting when the current stock is above 2/3 of its maximum capacity. This allows for significant immediate gains while maintaining enough resource to sustain future growth.

2. **Threshold Monitoring**: Monitor the stock level and set a threshold at 2/3 of the maximum observed or initial capacity. If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to cooperation to allow the resource to recover.

3. **Recovery Phase**: Continue cooperating until the stock recovers above 50% of its maximum capacity. This ensures that the resource has enough time to regenerate before resuming exploitation.

4. **Sustainable Exploitation**: Once the stock is above 50%, revert to defecting, maintaining a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

This strategy aims to maximize short-term benefits while ensuring the resource remains viable for future use by preventing complete depletion.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy balances exploitation with conservation by defecting when the stock is above two-thirds of its maximum capacity and cooperating below one-third, allowing recovery. This ensures sustainable gains without depleting resources.

$\boxed{\text{Defect if current stock > 2/3 of max capacity; cooperate otherwise}}$

To maximize your payoff in the Common Pool Resource Game while exploiting others, follow this adaptive strategy:

### 1. **Initial Exploration (First 2-3 Rounds)**
   - **Action**: Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Test others' behavior. If most Cooperate, you gain more.
   - **Observation**: Note opponents' actions to predict future moves.

### 2. **Stock-Based Exploitation**
   - **High Stock (Above 75% of capacity):**
     - **Action**: Defect
       - Rationale: High growth potential; defecting doesn't deplete too much.
   - **Moderate Stock (30%-75%):**
     - **Action**: Cooperate if others mostly Cooperate; else, Defect
       - Rationale: Balance between exploiting and not over-depleting.
   - **Low Stock (<30%):**
     - **Action**: Cooperate
       - Rationale: Preserve stock for sustainability.

### 3. **Adaptation to Opponent Behavior**
   - **If Most Opponents Cooperate:**
     - **Action**: Defect
       - Rationale: Exploit their cooperation for higher payoff.
   - **If Many Defect:**
     - **Action**: Cooperate
       - Rationale: Prevent rapid depletion, allowing more rounds.

### 4. **Final Rounds Strategy (Last 2-3 Rounds)**
   - **Action**: Defect
     - Rationale: No need to preserve stock; maximize immediate payoff.

### 5. **Dynamic Adjustments**
   - Continuously monitor:
     - Stock level and growth.
     - Opponents' actions for behavioral patterns.
   - Adapt strategy as needed to exploit opportunities and prevent losses.

### Example Pseudocode

```python

    # Stock Level Analysis
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:

        if opponent_coop / len(history[-5:]) > 0.7:

        else:
            return 'C'  # Prevent rapid depletion
    else:  # Low stock, prioritize preservation

    # If nearing end of game (last 2-3 rounds)
    if round > r - 3:
        return 'D'  # Maximize immediate payoff
```

### Summary
This strategy balances exploiting others when possible with preserving the resource for long-term gains. By adapting to stock levels and opponent behaviors, it ensures maximum payoff while being robust against various strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_385 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing individual payoff while adapting to the game's dynamics and opponent behaviors. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Exploitation with Cooperation Thresholds

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set initial thresholds for cooperation based on stock level.
   - Monitor opponent behavior to detect patterns of defection or cooperation.

2. **Decision Rules per Round**:
   - **Round 1**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1)**:
     a. Calculate the current stock level, S.
     b. Determine the proportion of defectors in recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds).
     c. Compute an adjusted threshold that decreases as rounds progress: `adjusted_threshold = initial_threshold * (1 - (t/r))`.
     d. If `S > adjusted_threshold` AND `proportion_defectors < p` (where p is a parameter, e.g., 0.5), defect.
     e. Otherwise, cooperate.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round (t = r)**: Always defect to maximize final payoff.
   - **Stock Near Capacity**: Continue defecting as others' cooperation sustains the resource.
   - **Low Stock Levels**: Cooperate to allow recovery and preserve future exploitation opportunities.

4. **Adjustments Based on Opponent Behavior**:
   - If opponents frequently defect, lower p to switch to cooperation sooner.
   - Give higher weight to recent rounds when determining proportion_defectors for quicker adaptation.

5. **Considerations**:
   - Balance exploiting with preserving the resource to avoid collapse.
   - Leverage nonlinear growth dynamics where low stock levels recover more effectively.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def strategy(S, capacity, t, r, proportion_defectors):
    if t == 1:
        return 'Defect'
    
    initial_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    adjusted_threshold = initial_threshold * (1 - (t / r))
    
    p = 0.5  # Parameter for proportion of defectors threshold
    
    if S > adjusted_threshold and proportion_defectors < p:
        return 'Defect'
    else:
        return 'Cooperate'

# Example usage
S = current_stock_level
capacity = total_capacity
t = current_round_number
r = total_rounds
proportion_defectors = average_defection_rate_in_recent_rounds

action = strategy(S, capacity, t, r, proportion_defectors)
print(f"Action for round {t}: {action}")
```

### Summary

This strategy dynamically adapts to exploit when the resource is abundant and opponents are cooperating, while switching to cooperation when necessary to prevent collapse. By balancing immediate gains with future sustainability, it aims to maximize individual payoff effectively against diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_386 = '''
To exploit the situation effectively, you can adopt a strategy that balances immediate gains with sustainable resource management. Here's how:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to observe other players' behaviors without prematurely depleting the resource.

2. **Monitor Conditions**:
   - **Stock Level**: If the current stock drops below 70% of its capacity, switch to Defecting to exploit what's left.
   - **Defection Rate**: Track how many other players are defecting. If more than 30% of others Defected in previous rounds, start Defecting yourself.

3. **Adaptive Strategy**:
   - **Cooperate** when the stock is healthy (above 70%) and others are mostly Cooperating.
   - **Defect** when either the stock is low or a significant number of others are defecting, indicating potential exploitation opportunities.

This approach allows you to exploit the resource when conditions warrant it while preserving sustainability when possible. Here's how it translates into an algorithm:

### Algorithm
For each round \( t \):
1. If \( t == 1 \):
   - Action = Cooperate
2. Else:
   - Let \( S_t \) be the current stock.
   - Calculate the number of other players who Defected last round: \( \text{num\_defect\_last} \).
   - Compute the average defect rate: \( \text{avg\_defect\_rate} = \frac{\text{num\_defect\_last}}{n-1} \).
3. If either:
   - \( S_t < 0.7 \times \text{capacity} \) OR
   - \( \text{avg\_defect\_rate} > 0.3 \)
   - Then, Action = Defect
4. Else:
   - Action = Cooperate

This strategy maximizes immediate gains while being mindful of future rounds by adapting to the current state and others' actions.

### Final Answer

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Round (t=1):** Cooperate to maintain the resource.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Check if the stock is below 70% of capacity or if more than 30% of other players Defected last round.
   - If either condition is true, Defect to exploit the situation.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate to sustain the resource.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{If current stock is less than 70% of capacity or more than 30% of others defected in previous rounds, defect; else cooperate.}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_387 = '''
To address the problem, we've designed an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and recent opponent actions. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first few rounds to build up the resource (stock) and encourage others to also Cooperate.

2. **Monitor Opponents' Behavior**: Track the cooperation rate among opponents over the last K rounds. If more than P% of their actions were Cooperates, it's advantageous to Defect this round to exploit their kindness.

3. **Stock Consideration**: If the current stock is below a certain threshold, prioritize Cooperating to allow recovery and avoid further depletion, ensuring sustainable exploitation in future rounds.

4. **Late Game Exploitation**: In the last X rounds (e.g., 10% of total rounds), switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoff since future payoffs are limited.

5. **Adaptability**: Adjust parameters K, P, and X based on testing and opponent strategies to optimize performance. Consider incorporating slight randomness to avoid predictability.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, opponents_history, round_number, total_rounds):
    # Parameters
    THRESHOLD = capacity / 2  # Example threshold
    K = 5                     # Number of recent rounds to consider
    P = 0.6                   # Percentage of Cooperates needed to Defect
    X = int(total_rounds * 0.1)  # Last 10% of rounds

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'Cooperate'
    elif round_number > total_rounds - X:
        return 'Defect'
    else:
        recent_cooperates = sum(1 for history in opponents_history[-K:] for action in history.values() if action == 'Cooperate')
        total_actions = K * (number_of_opponents)
        cooperation_rate = recent_cooperates / total_actions

        if current_stock > THRESHOLD and cooperation_rate > P:
            return 'Defect'
        else:
            return 'Cooperate'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation**: The first round action is to Cooperate, fostering a stable resource environment.
  
- **Opponent Monitoring**: By examining recent actions, the strategy adapts to exploit when opponents are cooperative and switches to preservation when they're not.

- **Stock Threshold**: Maintaining a stock level above a threshold ensures that defecting doesn't lead to long-term resource depletion.

- **Late Game Strategy**: Defecting in the final rounds maximizes immediate gains without concern for future impacts.

This approach balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically to both current conditions and opponents' behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Purpose: Establish a baseline and observe opponents' initial moves.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Observation and Tracking:**
     - Track each opponent's actions (Cooperate/Defect) from previous rounds.
     - Calculate the ratio of Cooperates to Defects for each opponent.

   - **Decision Rules:**
     - If an opponent has predominantly Cooperated (e.g., >60% Cooperate), choose to Defect in this round. Exploit their cooperation for higher immediate payoff.
     - If an opponent has predominantly Defected (e.g., >60% Defect), switch to Cooperating more frequently to encourage resource preservation and potential future gains.

3. **Adjustment Based on Stock Level:**
   - **High Stock (Close to Capacity):** Favor Defection, as the resource is resilient, allowing exploitation of Cooperators.
   - **Low Stock:** Increase Cooperation to prevent resource collapse and allow stock regrowth through logistic growth dynamics.

4. **Last Few Rounds (Rounds r-2 to r):**
   - **Action:** Gradually increase the frequency of Defecting.
     - In the last round, defect regardless of previous behavior to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

5. **Adaptation and Balancing:**
   - Monitor overall stock trends and opponents' strategies. Adjust cooperation levels to prevent resource collapse while maximizing personal gains.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainable practices, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors and current game state to maximize cumulative payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_389 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed an adaptive strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by considering current stock levels and others' actions.

### Approach
The strategy involves:
1. **Defecting (D)** when safe to maximize short-term payoff.
2. **Cooperating (C)** to preserve the stock for future rounds if it's low or if too many others are defecting.
3. Using thresholds based on the current stock level and proportion of defectors from previous rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(stock_level, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    num_players = 4  # Assuming n=4 as per example context
    capacity = 100   # Example capacity; adjust based on actual game parameters
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    critical_mass = 0.6
    
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    previous_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'D') if history else 0
    proportion_defecting = previous_defectors / num_players
    
    stock_sufficient = stock_level > threshold
    safe_to_defect = proportion_defecting < critical_mass
    
    if stock_sufficient and safe_to_defect:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation
1. **Last Round Defection:** In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff.
2. **Threshold Check:** If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, consider defecting.
3. **Proportion of Defectors:** Only defect if less than 60% of players are defecting to avoid rapid depletion.
4. **Cooperation Otherwise:** Cooperate to preserve the stock when it's low or too many others are defecting.

This approach adaptively balances exploitation and preservation, aiming to maximize cumulative payoff over the game rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_390 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

The problem involves designing an exploitative AI strategy to maximize payoff in a game where players can Cooperate or Defect. The payoff depends on both the current action and the accumulated stock depletion. Here's how the solution is structured:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - The AI starts by Cooperating to encourage sustainable resource use and observe other players' behavior.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Check:** 
     - If the stock level is above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating to sustain high growth.
     - If between 40% and 80%, assess recent cooperation rates:
       - Calculate the proportion of Cooperate actions from all players in the last three rounds (or fewer if earlier).
       - Cooperate if more than 60% of actions were Cooperate; otherwise, Defect to capitalize on others' potential shift.
     - If below or equal to 40%, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoff as resources are scarce.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Always Defect to maximize the immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

**Answer:**

The AI strategy is structured to balance exploitation and sustainability based on stock levels and recent player behavior, with a focus on maximizing payoff while adapting dynamically:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate.
2. **Middle Rounds (except last):**
   - Cooperate if stock > 80% or cooperation rate in past rounds >60%; else, Defect.
3. **Last Round:** Always Defect.

This approach ensures maximum payoff by exploiting others when beneficial while maintaining resource sustainability when possible.

**Final Answer:**

The AI strategy is as follows:

1. Cooperate in the first round.
2. In subsequent rounds except the last:
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 80% of capacity or if more than 60% of recent actions were Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.
3. In the final round, always Defect to maximize payoff.

\boxed{
\text{Cooperate initially, adapt based on stock and cooperation rates, defect in the last round.}
}

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff by exploiting cooperative behavior of other players while maintaining the sustainability of the common pool resource.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Purpose: Encourage others to cooperate, stabilizing the stock and setting a foundation for future exploitation.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Monitor:
     - **Stock Level:** Current stock relative to capacity.
     - **Cooperation Rate:** Proportion of other players who have cooperated in recent rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds).
   - Decision:
     - If **stock > 75% of capacity** and **average cooperation rate among others > 60%**, then:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - Exploit the cooperative behavior while ensuring sustainability.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - Prevents over-depletion, maintaining a healthy stock for future exploitation.

3. **Last Few Rounds:**
   - If it's among the last 2-3 rounds:
     - **Action:** Defect (D)
       - Prioritize immediate high payoff as future rounds are limited.
   - Exception:
     - If **stock < 50% of capacity**, switch to Cooperate to allow some recovery, maximizing remaining rounds' potential.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate (C) to foster a cooperative environment initially.

- **Stock Near Capacity:**
  - Defect (D) if others are cooperating and stock remains above thresholds.
  - Switch to Cooperate (C) if stock begins to drop significantly, preventing depletion.

- **Last Round:**
  - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff with no future rounds left.

---

### **Summary of Strategy:**

1. **Early Rounds:** Cooperate to build trust and stabilize the resource.
2. **Middle Rounds:** Exploit by defecting when others cooperate and stock is high; switch back to cooperate if stock drops or others start defecting.
3. **Late Rounds:** Defect more to maximize payoffs, considering limited future rounds.

This strategy balances exploitation with maintaining sustainability, adapting dynamically based on the state of the resource and opponents' behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_392 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing immediate gains while ensuring sustainable exploitation. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Exploitation**: Begin by defecting in the first round to capitalize on potential cooperation from others.
2. **Adaptive Behavior**: Observe opponents' actions and adjust based on their behavior. If most are cooperating, continue exploiting by defecting.
3. **Threshold Adjustment**: Switch to cooperation when the stock is low or when many others have started defecting, preventing over-depletion.
4. **Final Round Exploitation**: Defect in the last round as there's no future consequence.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If more than a threshold (e.g., 60%) of players are cooperating, defect to exploit them.
  - If cooperation is low and stock is decreasing, switch to cooperate to allow regrowth.
- **Last Round**: Defect as there's no future impact.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Stock Near Capacity**: Defect initially; adjust based on others' actions.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Cooperate to enable recovery.
- **Final Round**: Always defect to maximize last payoff.

### Summary of Exploitative Strategy:

1. **Start Strongly with Defection**:
   - In the first round, defect to take advantage of potential cooperation from others.

2. **Adapt Based on Opponents' Behavior**:
   - Monitor previous rounds to assess the number of cooperators and defectors.
   - If a majority (e.g., over 60%) are cooperating, continue defecting to exploit their actions.

3. **Preserve Resources When Necessary**:
   - If cooperation is low or stock levels drop significantly, switch to cooperation to prevent rapid depletion and allow regrowth for future rounds.

4. **Maximize in the Last Round**:
   - Defect in the final round since there's no need to preserve resources for subsequent rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, remaining_rounds, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    if remaining_rounds == 1:
        return 'D'
    if len(history) == 0:
        # First round: defect
        return 'D'
    else:
        prev_cooperators = count_cooperators_in_last_round(history)
        threshold = 0.6 * n
        if prev_cooperators > threshold and current_stock > (0.5 * capacity):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Defection**: Exploit potential cooperation in the first round.
- **Adaptive Play**: Continue exploiting if others cooperate; switch to preserve resources when necessary.
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Balance between exploitation and sustainability based on stock levels and opponents' behavior.

This strategy aims to maximize immediate gains while ensuring future opportunities by dynamically adapting based on game state and opponent actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_393 = '''
The exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances immediate gains from defecting against long-term sustainability by adapting based on stock levels and trends. Here's the organized approach:

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** 
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Exploit others who may Cooperate, leveraging the high initial stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **High Stock Levels (Above 75% Capacity):**
     - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - **Rationale:** Safe to exploit as others might still be Cooperating.
   
   - **Moderate Stock Levels (Between 25% and 75% Capacity):**
     - Use a gradient approach, leaning more towards Cooperate as the stock decreases. Monitor trends:
       - If stock is stable or increasing, continue Defecting.
       - If stock shows a significant decrease trend, shift to Cooperate.

   - **Low Stock Levels (Below 25% Capacity):**
     - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - **Rationale:** Prevent resource collapse and allow growth for future exploitation.

3. **Stock Trends:**
   - Track the stock's behavior over recent rounds. A decreasing trend indicates more Defectors, prompting a shift to Cooperate to avoid mutual ruin.

4. **Opponent Behavior Inference:**
   - Observe others' payoffs (indicative of their actions). If most have high payoffs (suggesting Defect), consider Cooperating to replenish the stock.

### Edge Cases:
- **Last Few Rounds:** Increase defecting to maximize immediate gains without worrying about future rounds.
- **Stock Replenishment:** After Cooperate phases, revert to Defect as the stock recovers, exploiting others' potential Cooperation.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, stock_history, payoffs_others):
    capacity = 100  # Example value; adjust based on game parameters
    threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    
    recent_trend = calculate_trend(stock_history[-3:])  # Last three rounds
    
    # Check stock level
    if current_stock > threshold_high and recent_trend >= 0:
        return 'D'
    elif current_stock < threshold_low or recent_trend < -5:  # Arbitrary negative trend
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Consider opponent behavior based on payoffs
        count_defectors = sum(1 for payoff in payoffs_others if payoff > (current_stock / n) * 0.75)
        
        if count_defectors < len(payoffs_others) / 2:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def calculate_trend(stock_data):
    # Implement trend calculation, e.g., percentage change over the period
    pass
```

### Summary:
This strategy adaptively balances exploitation and sustainability by monitoring stock levels, trends, and inferred opponent behaviors. It starts with Defecting in the first round, defects when conditions are safe, cooperates to prevent collapse, and adjusts based on observed trends and others' actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_394 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Encourages others to cooperate by setting a positive precedent, maintaining stock levels, and allowing sustainable growth.

2. **Opponent Behavior Analysis:**
   - **Monitor Actions:** Track each opponent's choices in previous rounds.
   - **Adaptation:** 
     - If opponents frequently Defect (D), increase defection frequency to exploit their greed.
     - If opponents Cooperate (C) consistently, continue Cooperating to sustain payoffs.

3. **Stock Dynamics:**
   - **High Stock Levels (Above 50% of capacity):** Cooperate to encourage growth and maintain resource sustainability.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Consider Defecting to maximize immediate gains before potential collapse.

4. **Adaptation Over Rounds:**
   - **Early Rounds:** Prioritize Cooperation to build a stable environment.
   - **Mid-Rounds:** Adjust based on observed behaviors; increase Defection if opponents exploit.
   - **Late Rounds:** Weigh between Cooperating for sustainable payoffs and Defecting in the final rounds for immediate gain.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Start with Cooperate to set a positive tone.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize payoff, as future rounds are irrelevant.
   - **Near-Capacity Stock:** Cooperate to allow growth and avoid depletion risks.

6. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate If:**
     - Stock > 50% of capacity.
     - Most opponents Cooperated in recent rounds.
   - **Defect If:**
     - Stock < 30% of capacity, indicating potential exploitation.
     - Opponents are defecting frequently.

7. **Mitigation Strategies:**
   - **Prevent Over-Defection:** Maintain a threshold for stock levels to avoid rapid depletion.
   - **Responsive Mechanism:** Give more weight to recent opponent actions for quicker adaptation without causing instability.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, opponent_actions, round_number):
    # Parameters
    capacity = game_parameters.capacity
    total_rounds = game_parameters.r

    # Determine thresholds based on current stock and behavior analysis
    if stock_level > 0.5 * capacity:
        cooperate_threshold = 0.7  # Cooperate if most opponents have been cooperating
    else:
        cooperate_threshold = 0.3  # More cautious, defect more when stock is low

    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among opponents
    recent_rounds = opponent_actions[-10:]  # Consider last 10 rounds or fewer if game hasn't lasted that long
    cooperation_rate = sum(1 for action in recent_rounds if action == 'C') / len(recent_rounds) if recent_rounds else 0

    # Decision logic
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'  # Last round, maximize immediate payoff
    elif stock_level < 0.3 * capacity or cooperation_rate < 0.4:
        return 'D'  # Low stock or low cooperation from others, exploit by defecting
    else:
        if random.random() < cooperation_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage:
current_stock = game_state.stock
opponent_historical_actions = get_opponent_actions()
round_number = current_round

action = decide_action(current_stock, opponent_historical_actions, round_number)
```

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on the stock level and opponents' behaviors, aiming to exploit weaknesses while maintaining sustainability where possible.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_395 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize personal payoff by exploiting opponents' behaviors while preserving the resource when beneficial.

---

### **Decision Rules: When to Cooperate (C) vs Defect (D)**

1. **Early Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Purpose: Observe others' behavior and maintain a stable or growing stock for future exploitation.

2. **Middle Rounds (Middle 60% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - The majority of other players are cooperating.
     - The stock is above a critical threshold, indicating sustainability.
   - **Defect** if:
     - Many players are defecting, allowing exploitation of their behavior.
     - The stock remains high enough that defecting won't cause immediate significant depletion.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Purpose: Maximize immediate payoffs with no concern for future rounds.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments Based on Stock Trends:**
   - Monitor stock level and growth trends.
   - If the stock is declining due to excessive defection, switch to cooperating to prevent total depletion.
   - Use thresholds for stock levels and cooperation rates to decide actions adaptively.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Purpose: Set a cooperative baseline to observe others' behavior.

2. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Purpose: Exploit the last opportunity for maximum payoff without future consequences.

3. **Low Stock Levels:**
   - If the stock is very low, prioritize cooperation slightly to allow potential growth and secure some payoff.

---

### **Exploitative Mindset Alignment**

- Exploit cooperative opponents by defecting when they cooperate, maximizing personal gain.
- Adapt quickly if others start defecting en masse, shifting back to cooperation to prevent resource collapse.
- Use observed trends in stock levels and opponent behavior to dynamically adjust actions for optimal exploitation.

**Conclusion:** This strategy balances exploitation with preservation, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors and stock trends while maximizing personal payoff through careful action selection across different game phases.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_396 = '''
To address the problem, we need to devise an exploitative strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy should consider both the current state of the resource (stock level) and the behavior of opponents.

### Approach
1. **Initial Round**: Start by cooperating to gauge the initial behavior of other players.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Threshold**: Defect if the stock is above 60% of capacity, as this indicates a sufficient buffer for sustainable exploitation.
   - **Endgame Adjustment**: As the number of remaining rounds decreases, become more cautious to ensure some resource remains for future gains.
3. **Opponent Behavior Tracking**: Monitor opponents' actions. If a significant proportion (e.g., >70%) are defecting, switch to cooperating to prevent over-depletion and allow potential recovery.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock, capacity, n, opponent_actions_history):
    # Constants can be adjusted based on empirical testing or further analysis
    COOPERATION_THRESHOLD = 0.6  # 60% of capacity
    ENDGAME_ROUND_RATIO = 0.1     # Consider last 10% as endgame
    DEFECT_PROPORTION_TRIGGER = 0.7  # If >70% opponents are defecting
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    remaining_rounds = len(opponent_actions_history) + 1  # Including current round?
    total_rounds = opponent_actions_history.maxlen if hasattr(opponent_actions_history, 'maxlen') else (round_number -1)
    
    # Calculate thresholds dynamically
    safe_stock_level = COOPERATION_THRESHOLD * capacity
    endgame_rounds = max(1, int(total_rounds * ENDGAME_ROUND_RATIO))
    
    if remaining_rounds <= endgame_rounds:
        # Near the end, prioritize immediate gain with some caution
        return 'D' if stock > 0.3 * capacity else 'C'
    
    recent_defections = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions_history[-5:] if action == 'D')
    recent_defect_proportion = recent_defections / len(opponent_actions_history[-5:]) if len(opponent_actions_history) >=5 else 0
    
    # Decide based on stock level and opponent behavior
    if stock > safe_stock_level:
        return 'D'
    elif recent_defect_proportion > DEFECT_PROPORTION_TRIGGER:
        # If many are defecting, try to sustain resource by cooperating
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Cooperation**: The first move is cooperation to observe other players' strategies.
2. **Threshold-Based Defection**: For subsequent rounds, defect if the stock is above 60% of capacity to exploit while ensuring sustainability.
3. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last 10% of rounds, focus on immediate gains cautiously to prevent total depletion.
4. **Opponent Behavior Adaptation**: Monitor recent opponent actions; if a high proportion are defecting, switch to cooperation to allow resource recovery and sustain future exploitation.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adapting based on the current state of the resource and opponents' behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_397 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set a threshold for the stock level at 50% of capacity (e.g., `threshold = 0.5 * capacity`).
   - Determine the last few rounds where defection will be prioritized to maximize payoff without considering future impacts.

2. **First Round:**
   - Choose to Cooperate to observe others' behavior and contribute to building a sustainable resource level.

3. **Middle Rounds (Rounds after the first until the last 20% of total rounds):**
   - Check the current stock level (`S_t`).
     - If `S_t < threshold`: Cooperate to help replenish the stock.
     - Else:
       - Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players in recent rounds (e.g., past 5 rounds).
         - If this average exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 50%): Defect, exploiting others' sustenance efforts.
         - Otherwise: Cooperate to prevent over-depletion.

4. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20% of total rounds):**
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without worrying about future consequences.

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation in Early Rounds:** Encourages others to sustain the resource, allowing for potential exploitation later.
- **Adaptive Strategy Based on Stock Level and Others' Behavior:** Balances between exploiting when possible and conserving when necessary to prevent resource collapse.
- **Defection in Final Rounds:** Prioritizes immediate gains since future rounds are no longer a consideration.

This approach is designed to be adaptive, allowing the strategy to evolve based on observed behaviors of other players while ensuring sustainability by cooperating when the resource is under threat.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_398 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a robust and adaptive approach that maximizes individual payoff while considering the game's dynamics. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Exploration**: Begin with defecting to assess others' behavior and the stock's resilience.
2. **Monitoring Mechanisms**: Track key metrics such as stock levels, opponents' actions, and relative payoffs.
3. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Adjust actions based on current conditions to exploit opportunities and mitigate risks.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initialization**:
   - In the first round, defect (D) to test others' responses and gauge the initial impact on the stock.

2. **Monitoring Mechanisms**:
   - Track the stock level over rounds.
   - Count the number of Cooperators (C) and Defectors (D) in each round.
   - Calculate the trend of stock growth or depletion.
   - Compare your cumulative payoff with others' to assess relative performance.

3. **Adaptive Decision Rules**:

   a. **Cooperation Trigger**:
      - If the stock is above 75% of capacity and more than half of players are cooperating, cooperate (C) to sustain the resource and benefit from its growth.

   b. **Defection Trigger**:
      - If the stock drops below 50%, defect (D) to exploit the remaining resource before it collapses.
      - If over half of players are defecting, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains.

   c. **Relative Payoff Adjustment**:
      - If your cumulative payoff is lower than others', increase defection frequency to catch up by exploiting higher payoffs from defects when possible.

4. **Endgame Handling**:
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., rounds r-2, r-1, r), defect consistently to maximize immediate gains without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = game_capacity()
    stock_history = [s for s in history]
    
    if len(stock_history) == 0:
        return 'D'  # First round: defect to test the waters
    
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    num_coop = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C')
    
    # Calculate stock trend (simplified as difference from initial)
    stock_trend = current_stock - capacity
    relative_payoff = calculate_relative_payoff(history)
    
    if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity and num_coop > n / 2:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < 0.5 * capacity or (len(history) >= 2 and num_coop < n / 2):
        return 'D'
    else:
        if relative_payoff < 1:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def calculate_relative_payoff(history):
    my_payoffs = [payoff for me, payoff in history]
    others_payoffs = []
    # Assuming history includes all players' payoffs
    for round_data in history:
        others = [p[1] for p in round_data if p[0] != 'me']
        others_payoffs.extend(others)
    avg_others = sum(others_payoffs) / len(others_payoffs)
    return sum(my_payoffs) / avg_others
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization**: The strategy starts by defecting to observe others' behavior and assess the stock's initial response.
- **Monitoring**: Key metrics like stock levels, opponents' actions, and relative payoffs are tracked to inform decisions.
- **Adaptive Rules**:
  - Cooperate when the resource is healthy and sustainably maintained by others.
  - Defect when the resource is threatened or when others are exploiting it, ensuring you don't miss out on higher immediate gains.
  - Adjust based on your relative performance to ensure you're not falling behind in payoffs.
- **Endgame Handling**: Ensures maximum exploitation in the final rounds without regard for future consequences.

This strategy balances exploitation of opponents' behavior with adaptive responses to changing game conditions, aiming to maximize individual payoff over the rounds.

**Exploitative Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' cooperation while maintaining enough sustainability to prevent rapid resource depletion.

2. **Strategy Components:**
   - **Initial Exploration:** Start with cooperation in the first round to encourage others and gather data on their behaviors.
   - **Adaptive Exploitation:** Defect when a sufficient number of players cooperate, exploiting their strategy for immediate gains.
   - **Stock Level Management:** Cooperate when stock is low to aid recovery and defect when stock is high to maximize payoff without risking depletion.
   - **Opponent Modeling:** Track opponents' past actions to infer their strategies and adjust exploitation accordingly.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to observe others' initial moves.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - If the majority (>60%) of players cooperated in the previous round, Defect (D) to exploit their cooperation.
     - If stock is below 75% of capacity, Cooperate (C) to prevent further depletion and aid growth.
     - Adjust based on a dynamic threshold for cooperation levels observed over recent rounds.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Periodically reassess thresholds and strategies based on observed trends in opponent behavior and stock dynamics.
   - In the last few rounds, switch to Defect (D) to exploit any remaining Cooperators without worrying about long-term sustainability.

5. **Pseudocode Overview:**

```pseudocode
Initialize:
    cooperate_next = True
    defectors_prev_round = 0
    cooperation_threshold = 0.6  // 60% threshold
    low_stock_threshold = 0.75 * capacity

For each round t from 1 to r:
    If t == 1:
        Play C
        Record others' actions and stock level.
        Update defectors_prev_round = number of Ds in this round.
    Else:
        current_cooperators = n - defectors_prev_round
        cooperation_ratio = current_cooperators / n

        // Check if majority are Cooperating
        If cooperation_ratio > cooperation_threshold:
            Play D
        Else:
            Play C
        
        // Adjust based on stock level
        If (previous_stock < low_stock_threshold):
            Play C
        
        Record others' actions.
        Update defectors_prev_round = number of Ds in this round.

    // Periodically update thresholds based on observed trends
    If t % 5 == 0:
        cooperation_threshold = average_cooperation_ratio_over_last_5_rounds

// Edge Cases Handling:
- In the last few rounds (t > r - 3), switch to Defect to exploit any remaining Cooperators.
```

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors and stock levels to maximize individual payoff over multiple rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_400 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we'll outline a strategic approach that balances exploitation with sustainability based on the observed state and history of the game.

### Approach
The strategy is designed to maximize immediate payoffs while ensuring long-term sustainability by monitoring the stock level. It employs the following key principles:

1. **Initial Exploitation**: Begin by defecting (D) to gain higher immediate payoffs.
2. **Threshold-Based Adjustments**:
   - Continue defecting as long as the stock remains above a high threshold (75% of capacity).
   - Switch to cooperation (C) once the stock drops below a low threshold (25% of capacity) to allow replenishment.
3. **Hysteresis Effect**: Maintain the current action unless the stock crosses specific thresholds, preventing frequent switches and providing stability.
4. **Final Exploitation**: Always defect in the last round to maximize the final payoff.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(history, opponent_history, score, opponent_score, food_remaining):
    # Initial rounds default to Defect (D)
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate current stock based on history
    # Note: This is a simplified representation; actual implementation would track stock changes over rounds.
    capacity = 100  # Example maximum stock capacity
    threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity
    
    current_stock = food_remaining  # Assuming 'food_remaining' is the current state of the resource
    
    # Determine last action to apply hysteresis
    last_action = history[-1] if len(history) > 0 else 'D'
    
    if last_action == 'D':
        if current_stock > threshold_low:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif last_action == 'C':
        if current_stock < threshold_high:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # Default to Defect if none of the above conditions apply
    return 'D'
```

### Explanation
The strategy begins by defecting (D) to immediately exploit the resource. It continues this behavior as long as the stock remains above 25% of capacity, ensuring that there is enough resource left for future exploitation. When the stock drops below 25%, it switches to cooperation (C) to allow replenishment, preventing total depletion.

The hysteresis effect ensures that once cooperation starts, it continues until the stock recovers significantly (above 75% of capacity), avoiding unnecessary switching and providing stability. In the last round, the strategy always defects to maximize the final payoff, capitalizing on any remaining resource without regard for future sustainability since there are no subsequent rounds.

This approach effectively balances immediate gains with long-term considerations, allowing for sustained exploitation while preventing complete resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_401 = '''
To determine whether to cooperate or defect in each round, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Cooperate in the first round** as a starting point.

2. **For subsequent rounds**, calculate the depletion of stock from the previous round:
   - Compute `depletion = S_prev - S_current`.
   
3. **Determine expected depletion if everyone had Cooperated**:
   - Expected depletion with full Cooperation is `S_prev / 2`.

4. **Compare actual depletion to expected depletion**:
   - If `depletion > (Expected_depletion_Cooperate + ε)`, where ε is a small threshold to account for minor variations, it indicates others are defecting. Therefore, **Cooperate**.
   - Otherwise, others are likely Cooperating; hence, **Defect** to exploit their Cooperation.

This adaptive strategy allows you to maximize your payoff while considering the impact of others' actions on the stock.

$\boxed{\text{Adapt dynamically based on observed depletion compared to expected Cooperation}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_402 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to observe others' behavior without immediate exploitation.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - Calculate the proportion of Cooperators from the previous round.
     - If more than 60% of players Cooperated, Defect to exploit their cooperation.
     - If less than or equal to 60% Cooperated, Cooperate to prevent over-depletion and preserve the resource for future exploitation.

2. **Stock Threshold Consideration:**
   - If the current stock is below 30% of capacity, switch to Cooperate regardless of others' actions to allow growth and prevent collapse.

3. **Endgame Strategy (Last Few Rounds):**
   - In the last third of rounds, prioritize Defecting to maximize immediate payoff since there's minimal impact on future rounds.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate.
   - **Last Round(s):** Defect to exploit remaining stock.
   - **Low Stock (below 20% capacity):** Always Cooperate to allow growth.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term resource preservation, adapting dynamically based on others' actions and the state of the common pool.
'''

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**
Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' cooperative tendencies while preserving the resource to avoid mutual ruin.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to observe other players' behaviors and assess the initial stock dynamics.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Current Stock Check:** 
     - If the stock is above 70% of capacity, defect to exploit others' cooperation.
     - If the stock is below 30%, cooperate to prevent further depletion and encourage resource preservation.
   - **Cooperation Level Assessment:**
     - Track the number of cooperators in previous rounds. If more than half of other players cooperated last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff.
     - If defection levels are high (more than half), switch to cooperation to prevent stock collapse.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there is no future benefit to consider.

**Punishment Mechanism:**
- If other players defect while you cooperate, respond by defecting in subsequent rounds to punish them and reduce their payoffs, aiming to revert others to cooperation.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect.
- **Low Stock Situations:** Prioritize Cooperation to prevent stock depletion and sustain growth for future rounds.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track the current stock relative to capacity thresholds (70%, 30%).
2. **Assess Cooperation Trends:** Keep a count of cooperative actions from other players in recent rounds.
3. **Adjust Strategy Dynamically:** Use observed cooperation levels and stock health to decide between Cooperate or Defect.

**Summary:**
This strategy balances exploitation with preservation, ensuring maximum payoff while preventing resource collapse through adaptive behavior based on others' actions and current stock conditions.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_404 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability while exploiting others' cooperation, we can implement a strategic approach that adapts based on current conditions and historical behavior.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating in the first round to signal willingness to maintain resource levels and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Final Round Exploitation:** In the last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making:** For middle rounds, use a dynamic threshold based on remaining rounds:
   - If more than 80% of rounds remain: Set threshold (T) at 60% of capacity.
   - If fewer than 80% of rounds remain: Lower T to 50% of capacity to encourage more defecting as the game progresses.

4. **Assess Previous Cooperation:** Evaluate the proportion of Cooperators in the previous round. Only Defect if this proportion is at least 70%, indicating others are sustaining the resource adequately.

5. **Stock Health Check:** Always Cooperate if the current stock is below 30% of capacity to prevent a crash and allow potential recovery.

6. **Dynamic Adjustment:** If defecting would cause the remaining stock to drop significantly, reconsider the decision based on whether future exploitation is feasible or if cooperation is necessary for recovery.

**Answer:**

To balance immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability while exploiting others' cooperative behavior:

1. **Start by Cooperating:** In the first round, choose to Cooperate to encourage a collaborative environment.

2. **Defect in the Last Round:** Exploit the last round by Defecting for maximum payoff without concern for future consequences.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - For early rounds (more than 80% remaining), set threshold T = 60% of capacity.
   - For later rounds, lower T to 50% to encourage more defecting as long-term impacts diminish.

4. **Assess Previous Cooperation:** Only Defect if at least 70% of players Cooperated in the previous round, ensuring others are sustaining the resource adequately.

5. **Prevent Stock Collapse:** Always Cooperate when current stock is below 30% to allow recovery and prevent a crash that could harm future exploitation opportunities.

By following these steps, you can strategically exploit cooperation while maintaining enough resource sustainability for continued gains. 

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate in the first round, defect in the last, dynamically adjust based on stock and previous cooperation rates, ensuring to cooperate when stock is low to prevent collapse}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_405 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing immediate payoff while considering future rounds in a dynamic environment where other players may cooperate or defect, we have developed an adaptive strategy. This strategy takes into account the current stock level relative to capacity, the cooperation rate among other players, and adjusts its behavior dynamically.

### Approach
The approach is divided into three main phases:

1. **Initial Round**: Start by defecting to gain maximum immediate payoff.
2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - Track the cooperation rate of other players over recent rounds.
   - If many others are cooperating (high cooperation rate), continue defecting to exploit their behavior.
   - Adjust a dynamic threshold based on the round number and stock level; if the current stock is above this threshold, defect; otherwise, switch to cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow regrowth.
3. **Last Round**: Always defect to maximize final payoff.

The strategy dynamically adjusts thresholds and adapts based on observed behavior of other players and changes in the stock level, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and future sustainability.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, n_players, previous_actions):
    # Initial Round: Always defect
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate among other players in recent rounds (last 5)
    recent_coop = sum(1 for actions in previous_actions[-5:] for a in actions[1:] if a == 'C')
    total_recent = len(previous_actions[-5:]) * (n_players - 1) if previous_actions else n_players - 1
    cooperation_rate = recent_coop / total_recent if total_recent != 0 else 0
    
    # Determine dynamic threshold based on current_round and capacity
    max_rounds = total_rounds
    progress = (current_round - 1) / (max_rounds - 1)
    base_threshold = 0.8 * capacity  # Starting high
    adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * (1 - progress)
    
    if current_stock > adjusted_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if cooperation_rate > 0.6:  # Exploit if others are cooperating
            return 'D'
        else:
            # If many defecting, consider switching to C
            total_defect_prev = sum(1 for actions in previous_actions[-5:] for a in actions[1:] if a == 'D')
            defect_rate = total_defect_prev / (len(previous_actions[-5:]) * (n_players - 1)) if len(previous_actions[-5:]) > 0 else 0
            if defect_rate > 0.6 and current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
    
    # As a fallback, cooperate to preserve resources
    return 'C'

# Example usage:
current_round = 2
total_rounds = 10
current_stock = 80
capacity = 100
n_players = 4
previous_actions = [[1, 'D', 'C', 'C'], [2, 'D', 'D', 'C']]  # Example of previous rounds' actions

action = determine_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, n_players, previous_actions)
print(f"Action for round {current_round}: {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round**: The strategy starts by defecting to gain the highest immediate payoff when the stock is at its maximum.
- **Middle Rounds**: The strategy adapts based on the cooperation rate of other players and a dynamically adjusted threshold. If others are cooperating, it exploits their behavior by defecting. If the stock level drops below the dynamic threshold or if many players are defecting, it switches to cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow regrowth.
- **Last Round**: The strategy defects to maximize the final payoff without worrying about future rounds.

This approach ensures a balance between exploiting immediate opportunities and preserving resources for future exploitation, making it robust against various player behaviors and game dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_406 = '''
To address the problem, we designed a strategy that combines early exploitation with adaptive preservation based on the current state of the resource and the behavior of other players. The strategy is as follows:

### Approach
1. **Early Exploitation:** Start by defecting in the first round to capitalize on others potentially cooperating.
2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Use a dynamic threshold that decreases over time, encouraging cooperation in later rounds to preserve the resource.
3. **Behavioral Adaptation:** Adjust the strategy based on the number of defects observed in previous rounds. If many players are defecting, lower the threshold earlier to switch to cooperation and prevent excessive depletion.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_stock, prev_defect_count, n, base_threshold, adjusted_rounds_remaining):
    # Parameters for dynamic adjustment
    round_impact = 0.8  # More weight given to later rounds
    defect_influence = 0.15  # Influence of others' defects on threshold

    # Calculate the adjusted threshold based on remaining rounds and others' behavior
    threshold = base_threshold * (round_impact ** adjusted_rounds_remaining) * \
                (1 - defect_influence * prev_defect_count / n)

    if current_stock > threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# Example usage:
n = 4  # Number of players
capacity = 100
base_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
r = 5  # Total rounds

current_stock = 80
prev_defect_count = 2  # From previous round
adjusted_rounds_remaining = r - 1  # After the first round, 4 remaining

# Determine action for next round
action = determine_action(current_stock, prev_defect_count, n, base_threshold, adjusted_rounds_remaining)
print("Action:", action)  # Output: 'D' or 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Dynamic Threshold:** The threshold is dynamically adjusted based on the number of remaining rounds and the defect behavior of others. This ensures that exploitation occurs when beneficial but switches to preservation as needed.
- **Behavioral Influence:** If a high proportion of players defect, the threshold lowers, encouraging cooperation to avoid resource collapse.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to changing conditions.

**ExploitOP Strategy: An Adaptive Exploitative Approach**

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' cooperation while managing resource depletion adaptively.

**Strategy Overview:**
- **Normal State (S ≥ C1):** Cooperate to sustain the resource and avoid collapse, ensuring long-term exploitation opportunities.
- **Exploit State (C2 ≤ S < C1):** Defect when possible; cooperate only if necessary to prevent immediate collapse.
- **Recovery State (C3 ≤ S < C2):** Cooperate heavily to rebuild stock, defecting only if others' defection is excessive.
- **Collapse State (S < C3):** Exploit as much as possible in remaining rounds.

**Threshold Calculations:**
- **C1 = 0.6 × capacity:** Healthy stock level for sustainable cooperation.
- **D2 = 0.4 × capacity:** Critical threshold for potential collapse.
- **C2 and C3:** Intermediate thresholds based on the number of players and their actions, adjusting dynamically.

**Decision Rules:**
1. **Normal State (S ≥ C1):**
   - Cooperate to maintain resource health and encourage others' cooperation.
   - Defect if others are defecting significantly, exploiting their choices.

2. **Exploit State (C2 ≤ S < C1):**
   - Default to defection; cooperate only if necessary to prevent collapse.
   - Monitor opponents; exploit their cooperation while avoiding unnecessary resource depletion.

3. **Recovery State (C3 ≤ S < C2):**
   - Cooperate to rebuild stock, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.
   - Defect sparingly if others are not cooperating enough, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

4. **Collapse State (S < C3):**
   - Focus on maximizing individual payoff by defecting in remaining rounds.
   - Exploit any residual cooperation, knowing the resource is nearing depletion.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate if stock is at capacity, setting a baseline for future exploitation opportunities.
- **Last Round (r=1):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there's no future impact.

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**
- Exploit others' cooperation when possible, defecting to gain higher payoffs.
- Balance exploitation with preventing rapid resource collapse to maintain long-term gains.

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Use thresholds to dynamically adjust behavior based on stock levels and opponent actions.
- Monitor opponents' strategies to adapt thresholds and exploit patterns effectively.

This strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, ensuring maximum individual payoff while managing the common pool resource's sustainability.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set `cooperation_threshold` dynamically based on current stock relative to capacity and opponents' defection rates.
   - Initialize `defect_probability` at 0.

2. **Early Rounds (First 5 rounds):**
   - Cooperate to encourage resource growth and observe opponents' behavior.

3. **Decision Rules:**

   a. **Cooperate Condition:**
      - If the current stock is between 20% and 80% of capacity, and opponents' defection rate is below a certain threshold (e.g., 30%), Cooperate.
   
   b. **Defect Conditions:**
      - If the stock is outside the 20-80% range or opponents' defection rate exceeds 30%, increase `defect_probability`.
      - Near the end of the game (last 10% rounds), prioritize Defection for immediate gains.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Calculate `cooperate_score` as a weighted average of stock health and opponents' cooperation.
   - Adjust thresholds based on observed stock changes and opponent behavior each round.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to build resource growth potential.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Increase Defection to exploit remaining resources without concern for future rounds.
   - **Stock Near Capacity or Very Low:** Adapt by Cooperating (near capacity) or defecting (very low).

6. **Implementation:**
   - Use pseudocode logic to dynamically decide actions based on current state and opponent history.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, opponents_defect_rate, round_number, total_rounds):
    early_rounds = 5
    late_round_threshold = int(total_rounds * 0.9)
    
    if round_number <= early_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    if round_number > late_round_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    cooperate_score = (stock_ratio) * 0.5 + (1 - opponents_defect_rate) * 0.5
    
    # Dynamic cooperation threshold
    ideal_range_low = 0.2
    ideal_range_high = 0.8
    
    if (stock_ratio > ideal_range_low and stock_ratio < ideal_range_high) and cooperate_score > 0.6:

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to foster resource replenishment.
- **Defection Rate Monitoring**: By examining the proportion of defecting actions over recent rounds, the strategy adapts if too many players are exploiting the resource.
- **Stock Trend Analysis**: Tracking stock levels helps determine if cooperation is effective. A significant drop indicates that defection might be more beneficial.
- **Final Round Defection**: Ensures maximum gain in the last round without regard for future consequences.

This approach balances immediate gains with sustaining the resource, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors and environmental changes.

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate in all rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Behavioral Analysis:** Calculate the proportion of Cooperate (C) and Defect (D) actions from all players each round.
   - **Stock Level Threshold:** Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity. If the stock is above 80% of capacity, consider defecting; if below 20%, lean towards cooperation.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **High Cooperation Rate (≥70% C):** Defect to exploit others' cooperation.
   - **Moderate Cooperation Rate (30%-69% C):** Flip a weighted coin favoring Defect (80% chance D, 20% C) to balance exploitation and sustainability.
   - **Low Cooperation Rate (<30% C):** Cooperate to prevent stock depletion and encourage others to defect.

4. **Final Rounds (Last 15% of Total Rounds):**

# Each round update current_round and call decision_rule with current_stock and cooperation_rate from previous rounds.

This strategy balances exploitation with the need to sustain the common pool resource over multiple rounds, adapting dynamically based on opponents' actions and stock levels.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_411 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing your payoff while considering the dynamic state of the resource (stock), we propose an adaptive strategy that evolves based on observed trends and others' actions. Here's a structured approach:

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation to observe others' behavior and assess the initial stock dynamics.
2. **Adaptive Exploitation**: Based on the observed trend of the stock (increasing, decreasing, or stable), decide whether to defect or cooperate:
   - If the stock is increasing or stable, defect to exploit others' cooperation.
   - If the stock is decreasing, switch to cooperation to allow recovery and prevent over-depletion.
3. **Endgame Handling**: In the final rounds, prioritize immediate payoff by defecting consistently.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_history, own_actions, others_last_actions):
    # Determine if it's one of the last 10% rounds
    total_rounds = len(stock_history) + round_number - 1  # Adjust as needed based on game setup
    endgame_threshold = total_rounds * 0.9
    if round_number > endgame_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    if len(stock_history) < 2:
        # Insufficient data to determine trend; default to Cooperate
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate the trend of the stock
    last_stock = stock_history[-1]
    second_last = stock_history[-2]
    if last_stock > second_last:
        trend = 'increasing'
    elif last_stock < second_last:
        trend = 'decreasing'
    else:
        trend = 'stable'
    
    # Decide based on the trend
    if trend in ['increasing', 'stable']:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts with cooperation to establish a baseline and understand others' actions.
- **Trend Analysis**: By analyzing the stock's trend (increasing, decreasing, stable), the strategy adapts its behavior. If the stock is stable or increasing, it exploits by defecting; if decreasing, it cooperates to allow recovery.
- **Endgame Exploitation**: Near the end of the game, the focus shifts to maximizing immediate payoff through consistent defection.

This approach balances exploitation and cooperation dynamically, ensuring long-term sustainability while maximizing individual gain.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_412 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and preservation of a shared resource, an optimal strategy is devised as follows:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to allow the resource to stabilize or grow.

2. **Dynamic Decision Making**:
   - For each subsequent round, evaluate the current stock level relative to a predetermined threshold (70% of capacity).
   - If the current stock exceeds 70%, defect to exploit the abundance, as the resource can likely recover from increased consumption.
   - If the stock is below or equal to 70%, cooperate to preserve the resource and ensure its sustainability for future exploitation.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term preservation, ensuring that exploitation occurs when resources are abundant and cooperation is prioritized when the resource is scarce. 

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy involves cooperating initially and defecting when the current stock exceeds 70% of capacity to exploit the resource while preserving it when levels are low.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock ≤ 70%, else defect}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_413 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize immediate payoff by exploiting others' behaviors while preserving the resource for future exploitation.

---

### **Decision Rules:**
1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Cooperate to observe opponents' behavior and establish a baseline of their strategies.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate opponents' cooperation ratio (Coop Ratio) in recent rounds, giving more weight to the latest moves.
   - Assess the current stock level relative to capacity to determine thresholds for cooperation or defection.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds Based on Stock:**
   - **High Stock (Above 80% of capacity):** 
     - If Coop Ratio > 60%, Defect to exploit others' cooperation.
   - **Medium Stock (50%-80%):**
     - If Coop Ratio > 70%, consider Defecting cautiously, monitoring stock closely.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate to avoid rapid depletion.
   - **Low Stock (Below 50%):**
     - Cooperate primarily to allow resource recovery unless most opponents are defecting.

4. **Exploitation Mechanism:**
   - Target opponents with high Coop Ratios by defecting when they are likely to cooperate, especially in high or medium stock conditions.
   - Avoid defecting excessively when many are defecting to prevent resource collapse.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
   - **Stock Near Capacity:** Aggressively exploit by defecting if Coop Ratio is high, leveraging rapid growth potential.
   - **Critical Low Stock (Below 25%):** Always Cooperate to prevent total depletion.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, opponent_actions_history):
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to observe behavior
    if current_round < 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate opponents' cooperation ratio in recent rounds (last 5 rounds)
    recent_opponent_actions = opponent_actions_history[-5:]
    coop_count = sum(1 for action in recent_opponent_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    coop_ratio = coop_count / len(recent_opponent_actions) if recent_opponent_actions else 0.5
    
    # Determine stock level relative to capacity
    capacity = get_capacity()
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    medium_high_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        if coop_ratio > 0.6:
            return 'D'  # Exploit cooperation
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif medium_high_threshold < current_stock <= high_threshold:
        if coop_ratio > 0.7:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif low_threshold < current_stock <= medium_high_threshold:
        return 'C'  # Preserve resource
    else:  # Stock below critical threshold
        return 'C'

def last_round_action():
    return 'D'
```

---

### **Explanation:**
- The strategy begins with cooperation to gather information on opponents' tendencies.
- It dynamically adjusts based on recent opponent behavior and current stock levels, exploiting when advantageous while preserving resources for future exploitation.
- Thresholds ensure sustainable use of the resource, preventing premature depletion while maximizing immediate gains.

This approach balances short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting to evolving conditions in the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_414 = '''
To address the problem, we'll outline an exploitative strategy that balances immediate gains with sustainable resource management. Here's a structured decision rule based on the reasoning above:

**Decision Rule:**

1. **Initial Exploitation Phase:**
   - **Defect** in the first few rounds if the current stock is above 75% of capacity (e.g., >75 when capacity=100).
   - Rationale: High stock allows for significant immediate gains without risking severe depletion.

2. **Stock Threshold Adjustment:**
   - After each round, adjust your strategy based on the new stock level.
     - If the stock drops below 75% but remains above 50%, continue to **Defect** if others are mostly Cooperating.
     - If the stock falls below 50%, switch to **Cooperating** to allow regrowth.

3. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Monitor the number of Defectors in each round:
     - If more than half of other players are Defecting, increase your tendency to **Cooperate** to prevent further depletion.
     - Conversely, if most others are Cooperating, maintain or increase your Defection.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last 20% of rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds out of 25), prioritize immediate gains by **Defecting** more frequently to maximize payoff before the game ends.

**Formulaic Representation:**

Let \( S \) be the current stock, \( C \) be capacity, and \( R_{remaining} \) be the number of remaining rounds. 

- If \( S > 0.75C \), **Defect**.
- Else if \( 0.5C < S \leq 0.75C \):
  - Defect if fewer than 30% of other players Defected in the previous round.
  - Cooperate otherwise.
- If \( S \leq 0.5C \), **Cooperate**.
- In the last 20% of rounds, always **Defect**.

This strategy balances exploiting when possible with preserving the stock for future gains, adapting dynamically based on others' actions and remaining game length.

**Answer:**

The exploitative strategy is to defect initially when the stock is high, switch to cooperating if the stock drops significantly or too many others defect, and increase defection as the game nears its end. This approach is encapsulated in the following decision rule:

- **Defect** if the current stock exceeds 75% of capacity.
- **Cooperate** if the stock falls below 50%, or if more than half of other players are defecting.
- In the last 20% of rounds, prioritize **Defection** to maximize immediate gains.

The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Adaptively Defect when Stock is High and Cooperate as Needed}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_415 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to be exploitative yet adaptive, ensuring maximum payoff while maintaining resource sustainability. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Immediate Payoff Maximization**: Exploit cooperation from others by defecting when possible, as it provides higher immediate payoffs.
2. **Stock Dynamics Awareness**: Monitor the stock level and its growth to prevent depletion, adjusting behavior based on current and past stock conditions.
3. **Adaptive Response**: Adjust actions in response to opponents' strategies, balancing exploitation with preservation of resources.

### Detailed Strategy:

#### 1. Immediate Payoff Maximization:
- **Early Rounds**: Start by defecting to gain higher immediate payoffs, assuming some players may cooperate initially.
- **Last Round**: Always defect in the last round since there's no future impact.

#### 2. Stock Dynamics Awareness:
- **Monitor Stock Levels**: Track the current stock and its growth. Use thresholds to determine when to switch from defecting to cooperating to prevent resource depletion.
- **Growth Calculation**: Understand that the stock can recover based on remaining levels, so preserving it through cooperation when necessary is crucial.

#### 3. Adaptive Response:
- **Opponents' Actions**: Calculate a moving average of opponents' consumption to gauge their strategy trends (cooperating or defecting).
- **Threshold-Based Switching**:
  - If the stock is above a high threshold and many are cooperating, continue defecting.
  - As the stock drops below moderate thresholds, increase cooperation to allow recovery.
  - Below a critical low threshold, fully cooperate to prevent further depletion.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff with no prior history.
- **Last Round**: Defect regardless of previous behavior since future rounds don't exist.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set thresholds (e.g., high = 0.8*capacity, moderate = 0.6*capacity, low = 0.4*capacity).
   - Track opponents' average consumption and stock levels over time.

2. **Each Round Except Last**:
   - If stock > high threshold: Defect if others are cooperating; else cooperate.
   - Moderate threshold (moderate < S ≤ high): Balance between defecting and cooperating based on opponents' actions.
   - Low threshold (low < S ≤ moderate): Increase cooperation to aid recovery.
   - Below low threshold: Cooperate fully.

3. **Last Round**:
   - Always defect to maximize final payoff.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def strategy(history, opponent Histories, currentStock, capacity):
    round = len(history) + 1
    r_total = total rounds
    
    # Thresholds
    highThreshold = 0.8 * capacity
    moderateThreshold = 0.6 * capacity
    lowThreshold = 0.4 * capacity
    
    if round == r_total:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate opponents' average cooperation rate
    avgOppCoop = calculate_avg_cooperation(opponentHistories)
    
    if currentStock > highThreshold:
        if avgOppCoop > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif moderateThreshold < currentStock <= highThreshold:
        if avgOppCoop > 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    elif lowThreshold < currentStock <= moderateThreshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'C'

def calculate_avg_cooperation(opponentHistories):
    total = sum([sum(history) for history in opponentHistories])
    games = len(opponentHistories[0]) * len(opponentHistories)
    return total / games
```

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to opponents' behaviors while preserving the resource for future gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_416 = '''
To address this problem, we need to develop an AI strategy that maximizes its own payoff in each round of a game where players can either cooperate or defect. The game involves multiple rounds, and the state of the game (stock level) evolves based on the actions taken by all players.

### Approach
The strategy is designed to be exploitative, meaning it aims to maximize immediate payoffs while considering the long-term sustainability of the stock. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Early Rounds**: The AI starts by cooperating in the initial rounds to observe opponent behavior and maintain a high stock level.
2. **Late Rounds**: In the final 10% of rounds, the AI always defects to maximize immediate payoffs since the long-term sustainability is no longer a concern.
3. **Middle Rounds**: For the majority of the game, the AI adapts its strategy based on recent opponent behavior and current stock levels:
   - If more than half of the opponents have defected in recent rounds, the AI considers defecting but checks if the remaining stock after consumption will allow sufficient recovery.
   - The AI estimates the total consumption if it defects and others follow suit. It calculates the remaining stock and growth to determine if defecting is safe (i.e., the stock can recover sufficiently).

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(history):
    n = history.num_players
    r_total = history.total_rounds
    current_round = history.current_round + 1  # Assuming rounds are 0-indexed in history
    current_stock = history.stock[-1]
    
    if current_round <= 0.2 * r_total:
        return 'C'
    
    if current_round > 0.9 * r_total:
        return 'D'
    
    last_k = min(3, current_round)
    recent_defections = count_defections(history, last_k)
    
    if recent_defections / (n - 1) > 0.5:
        threshold_stock = 0.5 * history.capacity
        estimated_defectors = recent_defections + 1
        
        total_consumption = (estimated_defectors * (current_stock / n)) 
        total_consumption += ((n - estimated_defectors) * (current_stock / (2 * n)))
        
        s_remaining = current_stock - total_consumption
        
        if s_remaining <= 0:
            return 'D'
        
        growth = 2 * s_remaining * (1 - s_remaining / history.capacity)
        new_stock = min(s_remaining + growth, history.capacity)
        
        if new_stock > threshold_stock:
            return 'D'
    
    return 'C'

def count_defections(history, last_k):
    defector_count = 0
    for i in range(-last_k, 0):
        round_actions = history.actions[i]
        for action in round_actions:
            if action == 'D':
                defector_count +=1
    return defector_count
```

### Explanation
- **Early Rounds**: The AI cooperates to maintain a high stock level and observe opponent behavior.
- **Late Rounds**: The AI defects to maximize immediate payoffs, as long-term sustainability is less critical near the end of the game.
- **Middle Rounds**: The AI adapts its strategy:
  - It calculates recent defection rates among opponents.
  - If more than half of opponents have recently defected, it estimates the impact on the stock if it defects.
  - It checks if defecting would leave enough stock to allow recovery through growth. If so, it defects; otherwise, it cooperates.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, allowing the AI to exploit opportunities while managing risks related to stock depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_417 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on exploiting cooperative players while maintaining the resource for future gains. The strategy adapts based on observed behaviors and game dynamics.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to build a stable stock level.
2. **Adaptive Exploitation:** Track recent cooperation rates among opponents. If more than 60% of recent actions are cooperative, defect to exploit higher immediate payoffs.
3. **Resource Preservation:** When less than or equal to 60% of recent actions are cooperative, switch back to cooperate to avoid stock depletion and encourage future exploitation opportunities.
4. **Endgame Exploitation:** In the last few rounds, defect to maximize immediate gains since there's no future payoff.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a stable resource base.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Defect to exploit without concern for future impacts.
- **Stock Levels:** Adjust exploitation based on stock proximity to capacity or depletion to prevent crashes.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(history, current_round, total_rounds, n, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate from last 5 rounds
    recent_coop = sum(1 for actions in history[-5:] for a in actions if a == 'C')
    total_actions_recent = min(len(history), 5) * n
    coop_rate = recent_coop / total_actions_recent if total_actions_recent !=0 else 0
    
    # Last few rounds: defect to maximize payoff
    if current_round > total_rounds - 3:
        return 'D'
    
    # Decision based on cooperation rate
    if coop_rate > 0.6:  # Exploit when others are cooperating
        return 'D'
    else:               # Cooperate to maintain resource
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Ensures a healthy stock level at the game's start, encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Adaptive Exploitation:** Monitors opponents' behavior over recent rounds. Exploits when cooperation is high, maximizing immediate payoffs.
- **Resource Preservation:** Switches back to cooperation when cooperation rates drop, preventing resource crashes and ensuring future exploitation opportunities.
- **Endgame Handling:** Maximizes gains in the final rounds without concern for long-term impacts.

This strategy effectively balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to various opponent behaviors while maximizing individual payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_418 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

The strategy involves balancing exploitation of others' cooperation with conservation of the resource based on current conditions. Here's a structured breakdown:

1. **Initial Strategy (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline and encourage others to cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation helps maintain a higher stock level, promoting sustainable growth for future rounds.

2. **Observation Phase:**
   - **Action:** Monitor the proportion of cooperation (p_C) from other players over recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds).
   - **Rationale:** Understanding others' behavior helps determine if exploiting their cooperation is feasible without depleting the resource too quickly.

3. **Defecting Conditions:**
   - **Action:** Defect if two conditions are met:
     a. The proportion of cooperation (p_C) among other players is above 60%.
     b. The current stock level (S) is above 75% of capacity.
   - **Rationale:** High cooperation means others are contributing less to consumption, allowing safe exploitation. A high stock buffer ensures sustainability despite increased consumption.

4. **Cooperating Conditions:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate if either condition fails:
     a. p_C drops below 60%, indicating others are defecting and further exploitation would harm the stock.
     b. S falls below 75% of capacity, necessitating conservation to allow regrowth.

5. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - **Action:** In the last few rounds (e.g., last 3-5), increase tendency to Defect as future rounds don't matter, maximizing immediate payoff.
   - **Rationale:** With no future penalties for overharvesting, defecting becomes advantageous despite potential stock depletion.

6. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - **Action:** Continuously adjust thresholds based on observed trends (e.g., if the stock recovers well despite some Defections, allow more lenient conditions).
   - **Rationale:** Adapting to changing conditions ensures optimal balance between exploitation and conservation.

**Summary of Strategy:**

- Begin by Cooperating to foster a cooperative environment.
- Monitor others' behavior and stock levels to decide when to exploit (Defect) safely.
- Switch back to Cooperate if others start defecting or the stock becomes low.
- Exploit more in final rounds to maximize payoff without worrying about long-term effects.

This adaptive strategy balances immediate gains with sustainability, ensuring optimal performance across various scenarios.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_419 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' cooperative tendencies while balancing resource preservation to sustain exploitation over multiple rounds.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Reasoning: Sets a baseline of cooperation, allowing observation of other players' initial strategies without prematurely depleting the resource.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the current stock level `S`.
   - Determine the proportion of Cooperators (`C_count`) and Defectors (`D_count`) in the previous round.
   
   - **If**:
     - The majority of players Cooperated last round (`C_count > D_count`), and
     - Current stock `S` is above 50% of capacity, then
     - **Action:** Defect.
       - Exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate payoff.
   
   - **Else If**:
     - The majority Defected last round (`D_count >= C_count`), or
     - Current stock `S` is below 50% of capacity, then
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
       - Preserve the resource to prevent collapse and allow growth for future exploitation.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

---

### **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**

- The 50% threshold is adjusted based on:
  - **Stock Growth Potential**: If `S_remaining` after consumption allows significant growth (`growth > S_remaining/2`), prioritize Cooperating to enhance future exploitation opportunities.
  - **Player Behavior**: If opponents frequently Defect, increase the threshold to cooperate more and sustain the resource.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to gather initial data on opponent strategies without risking resource collapse.
- **Low Stock (S < 25% capacity):** Switch to Cooperating to prevent further depletion and encourage recovery through growth.
- **High Stock (S > 75% capacity):** Cooperate to maximize growth potential, ensuring a healthy resource base for continued exploitation.

---

### **Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, round_number):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number < r:
        last_round_actions = history[-1]
        C_count = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions.values() if action == 'C')
        D_count = len(last_round_actions) - C_count
        
        # Calculate thresholds
        high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
        low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
        
        if current_stock > high_threshold:
            return 'C'  # Allow growth
        elif current_stock < low_threshold:
            return 'C'  # Prevent collapse
        else:
            if C_count > D_count:
                return 'D'  # Exploit cooperation
            else:
                return 'C'  # Preserve resource
    else:  # Last round
        return 'D'
```

---

### **Rationale:**

- **Exploitation:** Targets cooperative players to gain higher immediate payoffs.
- **Sustainability:** Adjusts actions based on stock levels and opponent behavior to prevent total resource collapse, ensuring continued exploitation opportunities.
- **Adaptability:** Dynamically responds to changing conditions and opponent strategies, making it robust against various behaviors.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, allowing for effective exploitation while managing resource dynamics.

To maximize your payoff while balancing resource depletion, follow this strategy:

1. **Early Rounds (First 20%):**
   - **Cooperate:** Start by Cooperating to observe others' behavior and maintain a higher stock level for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:**
     - If the current stock \( S_t \) is above 80% of capacity:
       - **Defect:** Exploit the resource while it's abundant.
     - If \( S_t \) drops below 60%:
       - **Cooperate:** Preserve the remaining resource to allow growth for future rounds.

3. **Adapt Based on Others' Actions:**
   - Track the number of Cooperators in previous rounds.
   - If more than half of players Cooperated last round, it's safe to Defect this round to exploit their behavior.

4. **Late Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Defect Aggressively:** Focus on maximizing immediate payoff since future rounds are limited.

**Implementation Steps:**

- In each round after the first few:
  - Check if \( S_t > 80\% \) capacity.
  - If yes, and if last round had significant Cooperators, Defect.
  - If \( S_t < 60\% \), switch to Cooperate.
  - In final rounds, always Defect.

**Final Answer:**

To maximize your payoff while managing resource depletion:

- Cooperate initially to preserve the stock.
- Defect when the stock is above 80% and others are cooperating.
- Switch to Cooperating if the stock drops below 60%.
- Defect aggressively in the final rounds.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when stock is low; defect when high, especially towards the end.}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_421 = '''
To create an effective exploitative strategy in a multi-round scenario where players can either Cooperate or Defect, we need to balance maximizing immediate gains with ensuring long-term sustainability. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to observe others' behavior and assess the initial state of the resource.
2. **Exploit When Safe**: If others are mostly Cooperating and the stock is healthy, Defect to exploit their cooperation.
3. **Sustain When Necessary**: If defecting becomes too common or the stock is low, switch back to Cooperating to allow recovery.
4. **Maximize Immediate Gain in Last Rounds**: In the final rounds, prioritize immediate payoff by Defecting unless the stock is critically low.

### Decision Rules

#### 1. First Round
- **Action**: Cooperate
  - Reason: Observe others' initial moves and the resource's state without impacting it early on.

#### 2. Subsequent Rounds (t = 2 to r-1)
- **Parameters**:
  - **High_Threshold**: 80% of capacity.
  - **Low_Threshold**: 40% of capacity.
  - Consider recent behavior, e.g., the proportion of Cooperators in the last 5 rounds.

- **Steps**:
  a. Calculate the proportion of Cooperators (`prev_coop`) and Defectors (`prev_defect_ratio = 1 - prev_coop`) from recent rounds (e.g., last 5).
  b. Check if the current stock level (`S`) is above `High_Threshold` or below `Low_Threshold`.
  c. If `S > High_Threshold` and `prev_coop > 60%`, **Defect** to exploit others.
  d. If `S < Low_Threshold` or `prev_defect_ratio > 70%`, **Cooperate** to help sustain the resource.
  e. Otherwise, use a weighted decision: more likely to Defect if `prev_coop` is high and `S` is healthy.

#### 3. Last Round (t = r)
- **Action**: 
  - If `S > 0`, **Defect** for maximum immediate payoff.
  - Else, **Cooperate** or Defect has no effect since stock is 0.

### Rationale
- By starting with Cooperation, the strategy allows observation of others' tendencies without early exploitation.
- Exploiting when safe (high cooperation and healthy stock) maximizes gains while minimizing resource depletion risks.
- Switching to Cooperation when defecting becomes prevalent prevents resource collapse, ensuring future rounds can still yield payoffs.
- In final rounds, maximizing immediate gain is prioritized as there's no future impact.

This approach balances short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on others' behavior and the resource's state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_422 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy should adapt based on the current stock level and the cooperation behavior of other players. Here's how it works:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

#### 1. Initialization
- **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C) to encourage others to also Cooperate, fostering a sustainable environment.
- **Thresholds**:
  - **Stock Threshold (ST)**: Set at 60% of the capacity. This ensures that there's enough resource left for growth after consumption.
  - **Cooperation Threshold (CT)**: If more than half of the players have Cooperated in recent rounds, it indicates a cooperative environment.

#### 2. Subsequent Rounds
For each round beyond the first:
1. **Assess Recent Cooperation**:
   - Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the last three rounds.
   
2. **Evaluate Current Stock**:
   - Check if the current stock is above the ST (60% capacity).

3. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate**: If both the current stock is above ST and more than half of recent actions were Cooperate (CT).
   - **Defect**: Otherwise, defect to exploit the resource while it's still available.

#### 3. Edge Cases
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
- **Low Stock or High Defection**: If the stock is below ST or more than half are defecting, switch to Defect to maximize immediate gains.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(round_history, current_stock, capacity):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate recent cooperation rate (last 3 rounds)
        recent_rounds = round_history[-3:]
        cooperate_count = sum(1 for hist in recent_rounds 
                              if any(action == 'C' for action in hist['actions']))
        defect_rate = 1 - (cooperate_count / len(recent_rounds))
        
        # Check current stock against threshold
        st = 0.6 * capacity
        ct = 0.5
        
        if current_stock > st and defect_rate < ct:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by Cooperating to encourage a sustainable resource use.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: By evaluating recent cooperation rates and the current stock level, the strategy adapts to exploit when necessary while maintaining sustainability.
- **Thresholds**: ST ensures enough resource for growth, while CT gauges if others are contributing to sustainability.

This approach balances immediate exploitation with long-term resource management, making it robust against varying opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_423 = '''
To address the problem of creating an adaptive strategy that balances exploitation with preservation of the game's resource (stock), we can outline a structured approach based on observed defection rates and current stock levels. The goal is to maximize immediate payoffs while ensuring sustainable future gains.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating in the first round to maintain a stable stock level, allowing observation of other players' behaviors.
   
2. **Track Defectors:** Maintain a record of the number of players who defect in each round. Calculate the defection rate (proportion of defectors) to gauge how cooperative or exploitative others are.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation:** Establish a dynamically adjusted threshold for stock levels that determines when it's beneficial to Defect. This threshold decreases as rounds progress, encouraging more Cooperation towards the endgame.
   
   - Formula: `threshold_stock(t) = capacity * (remaining_rounds / total_rounds)`
   
4. **Defection Decision Criteria:** Decide to Defect if:
   
   a. The defection rate from previous rounds exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 50%).
   
   b. The current stock is above the dynamically adjusted threshold.
   
5. **Cooperation Otherwise:** If either condition in step 4 isn't met, Cooperate to preserve or restore stock levels, ensuring sustainable future gains.

6. **Adaptation and Adjustment:** Continuously update the defection rate and adjust the threshold based on ongoing observations, allowing the strategy to adapt to changing player behaviors.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is a dynamic approach that adapts based on observed defection rates and current stock levels:

- **Initial Move:** Cooperate in the first round.
- **Track Behavior:** Monitor the number of defectors each round to determine the defection rate.
- **Dynamic Threshold:** Use the formula `threshold_stock(t) = capacity * (remaining_rounds / total_rounds)` to adjust when it's beneficial to Defect.
- **Defection Conditions:** Defect if the defection rate exceeds 50% and current stock is above the threshold; otherwise, Cooperate.

This strategy balances exploitation with preservation, maximizing payoffs while maintaining sustainable resource levels for future rounds.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially, then defect when defection rates exceed 50% and stock remains sufficient.}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_424 = '''
To design an effective exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting cooperative opponents while preserving the resource when necessary. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Exploration (First Round):**
   - Defect (D) to test opponents' reactions and gauge their willingness to cooperate or defect.

2. **Adaptive Exploitation (Middle Rounds):**
   - **Monitor Opponents:** Track the proportion of cooperation among opponents over recent rounds.
   - **Assess Stock Level:** Check if the current stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., half of capacity).
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If the stock is above the threshold and more than a certain percentage (e.g., 60%) of opponents have been cooperating, defect to exploit their cooperation.
     - Otherwise, cooperate (C) to help maintain or rebuild the resource.

3. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - In the last round, defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Pseudocode Representation

```pseudocode
Initialize:
    history = empty list
    current_stock = capacity  # Start with full stock
    opponents_coop_rate = []  # To track cooperation rates over time
    threshold = capacity / 2  # Critical stock level for exploitation
    exploit_threshold = 0.6   # Percentage of recent rounds where opponents cooperated

For each round from 1 to r:
    If it's the first round:
        action = D
    Else:
        recent_coop = calculate_recent_coop_rate(history, k=5)  # Last k rounds
        if current_stock > threshold and recent_coop >= exploit_threshold:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C
    history.append(action)
    Update opponents_coop_rate based on their actions
    Update current_stock using the game's stock dynamics

    If it's the last round:
        action = D  # Exploit without concern for future impact
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Exploration:** Starting with a defect allows observation of how opponents respond, setting the stage for adaptive strategies in subsequent rounds.
- **Adaptive Exploitation:** By monitoring cooperation rates and stock levels, the strategy exploits when safe (high stock and cooperative opponents) while preserving resources when necessary (low stock or high defection rates).
- **Final Round Adjustment:** Maximizing immediate payoff by defecting in the final round, as there's no need to preserve the resource for future rounds.

This strategy dynamically adapts to opponent behavior and current game state, balancing exploitation with preservation to optimize long-term gains while being robust against various opponent strategies.

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we must balance immediate gains with the sustainability of the resource. The strategy adapts based on current stock levels and recent opponent behaviors, exploiting cooperation when beneficial and conserving resources when necessary.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Move**: Start by defecting in the first round to test others' reactions.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **High Stock (Above 80% Capacity)**: Defect if most opponents are cooperating, exploiting their strategy for higher gains.
   - **Moderate Stock (60-80%)**: Defect if a significant number of opponents cooperate; otherwise, cooperate to prevent rapid depletion.
   - **Low Stock (Below 40%)**: Cooperate to allow recovery, ensuring future sustainability.
3. **Final Round**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff with no concern for future rounds.

### Detailed Decision Rules

1. **First Round**:
   - Action: Defect (D)
   - Rationale: Test others' behaviors and exploit potential cooperation.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - **Current Stock Check**:
     - If stock > 80% of capacity:
       - Recent Cooperation Rate (>60%): Defect.
       - Else: Cooperate to prevent others from over-depleting.
     - If 40% < stock ≤ 80%:
       - Recent Cooperation Rate (>40%): Defect.
       - Else: Cooperate.
     - If stock ≤ 40%: Cooperate to allow recovery.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**:
   - Action: Defect (D)
   - Rationale: No future rounds; exploit for maximum payoff.

### Adaptation Mechanism

- Track recent cooperation rates using a moving window of the last 5 rounds.
- Adjust thresholds dynamically based on stock trends and opponent behaviors to optimize exploitation and conservation.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **Stock Near Capacity**: Safely defect as growth can sustain consumption.
- **Very Low Stock**: Prioritize cooperation for recovery, ensuring future rounds' sustainability.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource management, adapting to exploit opponents while conserving the pool when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_426 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a strategic approach for an AI agent acting as an exploiter in a resource management game. The goal is to maximize immediate gains while considering potential future consequences. Here's the organized solution:

### Approach
The strategy consists of two main phases:
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to avoid crashing the stock if all players defect.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** Exploit when safe, defined by specific thresholds on current stock levels and previous player behavior.

#### Key Components:
- **Thresholds:**
  - **Stock Threshold:** 80% of the maximum capacity (`threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity`).
  - **Defection Rate Threshold:** Fewer than half of players defecting in the previous round (`D_prev < n_total / 2`).

- **Decision Logic:**
  - In the first round, always Cooperate.
  - From the second round onward:
    - If the current stock is above `threshold_high` and fewer than half of players Defected last round, defect to exploit the resource.
    - Otherwise, Cooperate to preserve the stock.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, S_current, D_prev, capacity, n_total):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
        if S_current > threshold_high and D_prev < (n_total / 2):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round Strategy:** By Cooperating in the first round, the AI avoids contributing to an immediate stock crash if everyone defects. This provides a baseline observation of other players' behaviors.
  
- **Exploitation Conditions:** From the second round onward, the AI defects only when:
  - The stock is sufficiently high (above 80% capacity) to ensure that exploitation doesn't lead to rapid depletion.
  - Fewer than half of the players Defected in the previous round, indicating that others are likely Cooperating or being cautious, reducing the risk of a collective crash.

- **Preservation When Necessary:** If either condition isn't met, the AI Cooperates to maintain stock levels for future rounds, balancing immediate gains with sustainable exploitation.

This approach effectively combines exploitative tendencies with prudent resource management, aiming to maximize gains while preventing premature stock depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_427 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on exploiting opponents' behavior patterns while balancing immediate and future payoffs. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to gather information about opponents' initial moves without significantly affecting stock dynamics.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** Adapt decisions based on observed opponent actions and current stock levels.
3. **Final Rounds (Last Few Rounds):** Shift towards maximizing immediate payoffs, defecting more as future rounds are limited.

### Detailed Strategy:

#### 1. Initial Round:
- **Action:** Cooperate
- **Rationale:** Start by Cooperating to observe opponents' initial moves without depleting the stock too much, allowing for informed decisions in subsequent rounds.

#### 2. Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 onwards):
- **Monitor Opponents' Actions:**
  - Track whether opponents Cooperate or Defect in each round.
  - Identify patterns or strategies they might be using (e.g., consistent Cooperators, Defectors).

- **Stock Level Assessment:**
  - Check the current stock level. If it's near capacity, defecting can provide higher immediate payoffs without significant future risks.
  - If stock is low, consider Cooperating to allow recovery for future rounds.

- **Decision Rules:**
  - **If Most Opponents Cooperate:** Defect to exploit their cooperation, gaining higher immediate payoff while others sustain the resource.
  - **If Many Defectors:** Cooperate more to preserve the resource. This prevents stock depletion and ensures a sustainable resource base for future gains.
  - **Stock Near Capacity:** Favor defecting as growth is minimal, and exploiting others' actions can yield higher payoffs without significant long-term harm.

#### 3. Final Rounds (Last r/4 rounds):
- **Action:** Defect
- **Rationale:** Since there's no concern for future rounds, maximize immediate payoff by defecting to gain the highest possible benefit in each remaining round.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def exploitative_strategy(round_number, stock_level, opponent_actions_history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    num_players = len(opponent_actions_history[0])
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate of opponents
    recent_opponent_cooperations = sum([action == 'C' for history in opponent_actions_history[-min(5, round_number-1):] for action in history])
    cooperation_rate = recent_opponent_cooperations / (num_players * min(5, round_number-1))
    
    # Determine if stock is low or high
    if stock_level < capacity * 0.3:  # Arbitrary threshold based on simulations
        current_strategy = 'C'
    else:
        current_strategy = 'D' if cooperation_rate > 0.6 else 'C'
    
    # In final rounds, defect more
    if round_number >= r - (r // 4):
        return 'D'
    
    return current_strategy
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:
- **Initial Round:** Always Cooperate to gather initial data.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - Calculate the cooperation rate among opponents over recent rounds.
  - If stock is low, favor Cooperating to allow recovery.
  - If most opponents are Cooperating, exploit by Defecting; otherwise, Cooperate more to preserve resources.
- **Final Rounds:** Switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains without worrying about future rounds.

This strategy adaptively exploits opponents' behaviors while balancing the need for sustainable resource management to ensure long-term payoff maximization.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_428 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and sustainability in a resource management scenario, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both the current state of the resource (stock) and recent behavior patterns of other players. The strategy aims to maximize individual gain while preventing over-depletion of the shared resource.

### Approach
The strategy is divided into three main phases:
1. **Initial Exploration**: Start by defecting in early rounds to test others' behavior and observe how they respond.
2. **Adaptive Defection/Cooperation**: Depending on the observed stock level and recent cooperation/defection rates among other players, decide whether to continue defecting or switch to cooperation.
3. **Sustainability Check**: Use predefined thresholds for the resource stock level to determine when it is safe to defect or necessary to cooperate.

### Solution Code
The strategy can be implemented with the following decision rules:

```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self, capacity=100):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.high_threshold = 0.8 * self.capacity
        self.low_threshold = 0.3 * self.capacity
        self.critical_defect_rate = 0.5  # 50% defect rate threshold
        self.m = 3  # number of past rounds to consider

    def decide(self, round_number, stock_level, history):
        """
        Decide whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D)
        based on current stock level and recent game history.
        """
        n_players = len(history[0]) if history else 1
        t = round_number + 1  # since rounds are 0-indexed in the list

        if t == 1 or t == 20:  # last round is fixed at 20
            return 'D'

        S_t = stock_level

        if t <= self.m:
            # Not enough history to compute recent defect rate reliably
            recent_defect_rate = sum(1 for past_round in history[:t-1] 
                                    for action in past_round if action == 'D') / (len(past_round) * len(history[:t-1]))
        else:
            relevant_history = history[-self.m:]
            total_d = 0
            for past_round in relevant_history:
                total_d += sum(1 for action in past_round if action == 'D')
            recent_defect_rate = total_d / (len(past_round) * self.m)

        if S_t > self.high_threshold:
            return 'D'
        elif S_t < self.low_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            if recent_defect_rate > self.critical_defect_rate:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The strategy sets thresholds for high and low resource levels (80% and 30% of capacity, respectively) and a critical defect rate (50%). These parameters help determine when to switch between cooperation and defection.

2. **Decision-Making**:
   - **First and Last Rounds**: Always defect to maximize immediate gain.
   - **High Resource Level (Above 80%)**: Defect since the resource is abundant, and the impact of individual defection is minimal.
   - **Low Resource Level (Below 30%)**: Cooperate to allow regrowth and prevent further depletion.
   - **Middle Range (30% to 80%)**: Switch based on recent defect rates. If more than half of recent actions are defects, cooperate; otherwise, defect.

This approach ensures that the strategy adapts dynamically to the current state of the resource and the behavior of other players, promoting a balance between exploitation and sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_429 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing your own payoff in a finite game with multiple rounds and interdependent outcomes based on other players' actions, we can outline a strategy that balances immediate gains with sustainable exploitation. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline: Exploitative Play with Recovery

1. **Initial Move (First Round):**
   - **Defect:** Start by defecting to maximize your immediate payoff, exploiting any naive cooperators.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels and Past Actions:**
     - Track the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - Observe the number of Cooperators and Defectors in previous rounds.

3. **Decision Rules Based on Stock Level:**
   - **High Stock (Above 75% Capacity):**
     - **Defect:** Exploit others by defecting, as there's ample resource to sustain high payoffs.
   - **Low Stock (Below 25% Capacity):**
     - **Cooperate:** Help recover the stock by cooperating, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.
   - **Moderate Stock (25-75% Capacity):**
     - Look at the number of Cooperators in the previous round:
       - If more than half Cooperated last round, **Defect** to exploit their cooperation.
       - Otherwise, **Cooperate** to support stock recovery.

4. **Adjustments:**
   - Use a threshold-based approach for stock levels (e.g., 25% and 75%) to decide between defecting or cooperating.
   - Consider the dynamics of other players' strategies implicitly through their past actions.

### Rationale:

- **Exploitation:** By defecting when others cooperate, especially with high resources, you maximize your immediate gain.
- **Sustainability:** Cooperating when the stock is low prevents rapid depletion, ensuring that future rounds have sufficient resources for continued exploitation.
- **Adaptability:** Adjusting based on previous actions allows the strategy to adapt dynamically as other players' behaviors evolve.

This approach ensures a balance between exploiting others and maintaining resources for long-term gains, making it both effective and sustainable in the context of the game.

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by adapting to other players' behaviors and managing the common pool's sustainability. Here's a structured approach:

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to gauge others' behavior.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **High Stock Levels:** If stock is above half capacity and many players are Cooperating, Defect to exploit the situation.
   - **Low or Declining Stock:** If stock is low and many are Defecting, Cooperate to prevent further depletion.
3. **Late Rounds (Last Few Rounds):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff with no future consequences.

### Metrics to Track:
- Stock level trends.
- Number of Cooperators vs. Defectors each round.
- Personal payoffs compared to others.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```pseudocode
Initialize: cooperate in first round

for each round t from 2 to r:
    analyze previous_round_data:
        stock_before, stock_after, num_cooperate, my_payoff, other_players_payoffs
    
    if stock_after > (capacity / 2) and num_cooperate > (n / 2):
        choose defect
    else if stock_after < (capacity / 2) and num_defect > (n / 2):
        choose cooperate
    else:
        maintain or adjust strategy based on trends
    
    if round t is in last few rounds:
        always defect

adjust thresholds dynamically based on observed patterns
```

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Start with Cooperate to observe others.
- **Near End of Game:** Defect more to exploit the remaining stock without concern for future depletion.

This strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable exploitation, adapting dynamically to maximize payoff while preventing complete resource collapse.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_431 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds: Exploit Cooperation**
   - In the first few rounds, defect (D) assuming others will cooperate. This maximizes immediate payoff while allowing stock recovery.

2. **Middle Rounds: Monitor and Adapt**
   - Track the average consumption and stock levels each round.
   - If stock depletion is significant due to many defections, switch to cooperation temporarily to allow growth.
   - Use dynamic thresholds based on observed behavior to decide between C and D.

3. **Final Rounds: Maximize Payoff**
   - In the last few rounds, defect aggressively as there's no future consequence for rapid resource depletion.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Defect assuming others cooperate.
   - **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize payoff without concern for future rounds.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate to prevent immediate depletion and allow growth before next round.

**Dynamic Threshold Approach:**

- Calculate the current stock level.
- Estimate expected growth based on historical data of consumption rates.
- Adjust decision thresholds dynamically; if defection leads to significant payoff without causing irreversible depletion, defect; otherwise, cooperate.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with sustainable resource management, adapting to varying opponent behaviors and game dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_432 = '''
To address the problem, we developed a strategy that balances exploitation with preservation based on historical cooperation rates and current stock levels. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to encourage others to do the same, setting a cooperative baseline.

2. **Adaptive Behavior**:
   - For rounds 2 to r-1 (excluding the last few rounds):
     - Calculate the cooperation rate from the previous round.
     - If the cooperation rate is above 50%, Defect to exploit the cooperative players, as their actions help maintain a sufficient stock level for regrowth.
     - If the cooperation rate is 50% or below, Cooperate to prevent further depletion and aid in resource regeneration.

3. **Final Exploitation**:
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%), always Defect to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future depletions since there are limited remaining opportunities.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the cooperation rate is exactly at the threshold, use the current stock level as a tiebreaker: Cooperate if the stock is below a certain point (e.g., 50% capacity) to aid regrowth; otherwise, Defect.
   
This strategy allows for exploitation when others are cooperative while preserving resources when necessary, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior and resource levels. 

**Answer:**

To exploit when others cooperate and preserve the resource when they defect, follow this strategy:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage cooperation among all players.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (until last few rounds)**:
   - If more than half of the players Cooperated in the previous round, Defect.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate.

3. **Last Few Rounds**:
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate gains.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When cooperation rate is exactly 50%, Cooperate if the current stock is below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity); otherwise, Defect.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially, defect when others cooperate, and always defect near the end}}

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a high stock base for future exploitation opportunities.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Last Round Check**: Always defect in the last round to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Opponents' Cooperation Rate**: Calculate the average cooperation rate from previous rounds to gauge opponent behavior.
   - **Stock Thresholds**:
     - If stock > 80% of capacity and avg_coop > 60%, Defect to exploit high cooperation.
     - If 50% ≤ stock ≤ 80% and avg_coop > 70%, Defect cautiously.
     - If stock < 50%, Cooperate to allow growth and prevent collapse.

3. **Dynamic Adjustments**:
   - Lower the required avg_coop for defecting as rounds remaining decrease, prioritizing short-term gains in later stages.
   - Prevents excessive depletion by always cooperating when stock is critically low (below 50%).

This strategy adapts dynamically, exploiting opponents while maintaining resource health to sustain long-term exploitation opportunities.

To address the problem effectively, we'll outline a strategy that balances immediate exploitation with necessary preservation to prevent resource collapse. This approach ensures maximum personal payoff while considering the sustainability of the resource.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set a threshold, typically 75% of the resource's capacity, to determine when to defect or cooperate.
   - Begin by defecting in the first round to maximize immediate gains.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Until the Last Round):**
   - **Check Current Stock:** Compare the current stock level with the predetermined threshold.
     - If the stock is above the threshold, continue defecting to exploit the resource maximally.
     - If the stock falls below the threshold, switch to cooperating to allow regrowth and prevent collapse.

3. **Final Round:**
   - Regardless of the stock level, defect in the last round to maximize the final payoff without concern for future rounds.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment (Optional):**
   - For advanced strategies, adjust the threshold based on observed trends in stock levels over previous rounds. This allows the strategy to adapt dynamically if the resource's behavior changes unexpectedly.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is:

- Defect in the first round and all subsequent rounds where the current stock exceeds 75% of its capacity.
- Cooperate when the stock drops below this threshold to allow regrowth.
- Defect again in the final round regardless of the stock level.

This approach ensures a balance between immediate gains and sustainable resource management, maximizing personal payoff while mitigating collapse risks.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Defect in the first and last rounds; defect when the current stock is above 75% capacity, otherwise cooperate.}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_435 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing immediate payoff and long-term sustainability when managing a shared resource, we propose an adaptive strategy based on thresholds. The approach is designed to prevent resource depletion while maximizing individual benefits.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Thresholds Definition:**
   - **T_low = 25:** This represents the minimum acceptable stock level below which cooperation is necessary to allow recovery.
   - **T_high = 75 (optional):** While not strictly enforced, it serves as a cautionary level where defecting could risk system-wide crashes.

2. **Decision Rules:**
   - If the current stock level (S) is **below T_low**, Cooperate to facilitate resource recovery and prevent future crashes.
   - If S is **above or equal to T_low**, Defect to gain a higher immediate payoff, balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

### Justification:

- **Cooperating Below T_low:** Ensures the resource can recover, preventing a permanent crash. This action allows for sustainable management and avoids scenarios where the stock depletes irreversibly.
  
- **Defecting Above T_low:** Maximizes immediate payoff while acknowledging the risk of system-wide crashes if too many players defect simultaneously. The strategy assumes that others may also defect, necessitating cautious cooperation when critical thresholds are met.

### Application Example:

In a scenario with `n=4` players and a capacity of 100:
- If S drops below 25, Cooperate to allow growth.
- At S = 62.5 (midway between T_low and T_high), Defect to capitalize on higher immediate returns.

### Conclusion:

This threshold-based strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by ensuring resource recovery when critically low and maximizing individual benefits at higher levels, thus fostering a stable system.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Exploit potential cooperators by maximizing immediate payoffs when the stock is at its maximum capacity, allowing for recovery.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** Continuously monitor the current stock level.
     - If stock > 80% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - Exploit others while the resource is sustainable.
     - Else if stock ≤ 80% and ≥40% of capacity:
       - **Assess Opponents' Behavior:**
         - Track historical actions to determine cooperation or defection trends.
         - If opponents are defecting, switch to Cooperate (C) to sustain the resource for future exploitation.
         - If opponents cooperate, continue Defecting (D).
     - If stock < 40% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - Prevent further depletion and ensure resource sustainability.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds, as the game concludes shortly.

4. **Opponent Behavior Modeling:**
   - Track each opponent's past actions to predict their strategies.
   - If a player consistently defects, exploit their behavior by defecting when others cooperate.
   - If many players cooperate, defect aggressively but monitor stock levels to avoid collapse.

5. **Stock Recovery and Sustainability:**
   - When switching to Cooperate (C), aim to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability.
   - Use historical data to adjust thresholds dynamically based on observed consumption patterns.

6. **Adaptation Mechanism:**
   - If the stock depletes rapidly due to widespread defection, switch to cooperation sooner than planned to prevent resource collapse and sustain future payoffs.

**Summary:**
This strategy adapts dynamically by exploiting others initially, monitoring stock levels and opponent behavior, switching to cooperation when necessary to ensure sustainability, and defecting in final rounds for maximum payoff. It balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, adjusting thresholds based on game state and opponents' actions.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_437 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a series of rounds based on the current stock level, we have developed a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

### Approach
The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff while ensuring the resource does not deplete too quickly. The key points are:

1. **Initial Defection**: Start by defecting to exploit others' cooperation and gain maximum immediate payoff.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: For subsequent rounds, decide based on the current stock level:
   - If the stock is above 70% of capacity, defect again as it's sustainable.
   - If below 70%, cooperate to help regrow the stock for future exploitation.

This approach ensures that we exploit when resources are abundant and conserve when they start to diminish, maintaining a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide(history, current_stock):
    n = len(history[0]) if history else 0  # Number of players
    capacity = 100  # Assuming the stock is normalized to a maximum of 100

    if not history:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > 0.7 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Defection**: The strategy begins with defection in the first round to maximize immediate payoff.
- **Subsequent Decisions**:
  - When the stock is above 70% of its maximum capacity, defecting continues as it is sustainable without causing rapid depletion.
  - When the stock drops below this threshold, cooperation is chosen to allow the resource to regrow, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.

This strategy effectively balances between exploiting when possible and conserving resources when necessary, aiming for a sustainable exploitation over multiple rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_438 = '''
To design a strategy that maximizes your payoff while considering the impact on future rounds, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Exploitation**: Start by defecting (D) in the early rounds when the stock is high to take advantage of higher immediate payoffs.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: Continuously track the current stock level after each round. If it drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 70% capacity), it's time to switch strategies to prevent rapid depletion.

3. **Cooperate for Regrowth**: Once the stock falls below the threshold, switch to cooperating (C) for several rounds to allow the resource to replenish, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.

4. **Adapt Based on Others' Behavior**: While in the cooperation phase, observe other players' actions. If they continue defecting heavily, extend the cooperation period to prevent a crash. If others start cooperating, resume defecting once the stock recovers.

5. **Final Exploitation Push**: In the final rounds (e.g., last 20%), defect as much as possible to maximize payoffs before the game ends.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is:

- Defect in the early rounds when the stock is high.
- Switch to cooperate once the stock falls below a critical threshold to allow regrowth.
- Resume defecting in later rounds, especially near the end of the game, to maximize final payoffs.

$\boxed{\text{Defect initially, switch to Cooperate when stock is low, then Defect again at the end}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_439 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy between cooperation (C) and defection (D), we analyze the impact on resource levels and future exploitation potential.

**Strategy:**
- **Defect (D)** if the current stock \( S \) is above 70% of capacity. This maximizes immediate payoff while ensuring sustainable growth.
- **Cooperate (C)** if \( S \) is at or below 70% to preserve resources for future exploitation.

**Answer:**
\boxed{C}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_440 = '''
To develop an exploitative strategy in this scenario, we can employ a decision rule based on the current stock level relative to a threshold derived from capacity. The strategy balances immediate gain with sustainable future payoffs by defecting when the stock is abundant and cooperating when it's low.

**Decision Rule:**
- **Defect** if the current stock \( S \) is greater than half of the capacity (\( \frac{\text{capacity}}{2} \)).
- **Cooperate** otherwise.

This approach ensures that we exploit the resource when it's plentiful, maximizing immediate payoffs, while preserving it when it becomes scarce to allow for future exploitation through growth.

**Answer:**
The AI will defect if the current stock exceeds half of the capacity and cooperate otherwise. Therefore, the strategy is:

- Defect if \( S > \frac{\text{capacity}}{2} \); else, cooperate.

\boxed{\text{Defect if } S > \frac{\text{capacity}}{2}; \text{ otherwise, cooperate}}

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' actions while maintaining resource sustainability for future exploitation.

---

### **1. Initial Round (Round 1)**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Establish a baseline and observe opponents' initial moves to inform subsequent decisions.

---

### **2. Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1)**

#### **Dynamic Thresholds:**
- **High Threshold (H):** 0.7 × capacity
- **Low Threshold (L):** 0.3 × capacity
- Adjust these thresholds dynamically based on observed stock trends and opponents' actions.

#### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Current Stock Analysis:**
   - If **S_t > H**: Defect (D)
     - Exploit the high stock for maximum immediate payoff.
   - If **S_t < L**: Cooperate (C)
     - Preserve the resource to allow regrowth for future exploitation.

2. **Between Thresholds (L ≤ S_t ≤ H):**
   - Calculate opponents' **average cooperation rate** over previous rounds.
   - If cooperation rate > 50%: Defect (D)
     - Exploit cooperative players by defecting while they sustain the resource.
   - Else: Cooperate (C)
     - Contribute to resource preservation when many are exploiting.

---

### **3. Last Round (Round r)**
- **Action:** Defect (D)
- **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

---

### **4. Edge Cases and Adjustments**

1. **Stock Near Capacity:**
   - Actively defect to maximize payoffs, as growth is minimal and won't be significantly affected by consumption.

2. **Stock Near Zero:**
   - Cooperate to allow regrowth; necessary for future exploitation attempts.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - After each round, slightly adjust thresholds based on stock changes:
     - If stock increases after defecting, raise H.
     - If stock depletes quickly when defecting, lower H and monitor opponents' cooperation rate more closely.

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
initialize:

    if t == 1:

    else:
        calculate avg_coop_rate = (total Cooperations by others) / (n-1) / (t-1)
        if S_t > cooperation_threshold:
            action = D
        elif S_t < low_stock_threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            if avg_coop_rate > 0.5:
                action = D
            else:
                action = C
    
    perform action, record payoff and others' actions

    # Adjust thresholds dynamically based on stock trends
    if t > 1:
        prev_stock = stock at t-1
        delta_stock = S_t - prev_stock
        if delta_stock > 0:  # Stock increased
            cooperation_threshold *= 1.02  # Encourage more defecting
        else:  # Stock decreased or stayed same
            cooperation_threshold *= 0.98  # Discourage defecting

    update thresholds:
        cooperation_threshold = max(cooperation_threshold, low_stock_threshold)
        cooperation_threshold = min(cooperation_threshold, capacity)

# Ensure last round action is Defect
if t == r and action != D:
    action = D
```

### **Final Notes:**
- The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by exploiting cooperative players while preserving the resource when necessary.
- Adjusting thresholds dynamically allows adaptation to opponents' behaviors and evolving game states, enhancing robustness across diverse scenarios.

### **1. Decision Rules: Cooperate or Defect?**
- **Initial Cooperation (First Round(s)):** Begin with cooperation to encourage others to do the same and build a sustainable stock.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:**  
  - **Majority Cooperation:** If most players cooperated in the previous round, defect to exploit their cooperation for higher payoff.

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_444 = '''
To address the problem of balancing resource exploitation with preservation while considering historical behavior, we can implement a strategy that adjusts based on current stock levels and recent trends. The solution involves three key thresholds and decision points:

1. **Low Stock Level (Below 30% Capacity):** Cooperate to preserve the remaining resource.
2. **High Stock Level (Above 70% Capacity):** Exploit by defecting if others have been mostly cooperating recently; otherwise, cooperate to prevent over-depletion.
3. **Intermediate Stock Levels (Between 30% and 70% Capacity):** Cooperate to avoid rapid depletion.

### Approach
The strategy uses the following steps:

1. **Threshold Definitions:** Set high (`H`) and low (`L`) thresholds at 70% and 30% of capacity, respectively.
2. **Immediate Preservation:** If the current stock is below `L`, cooperate to preserve what's left.
3. **Exploitation Check:** When the stock is above `H`, check recent behavior:
   - If less than 20% of recent actions were defects, defect to exploit.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to prevent over-depletion.
4. **Balanced Preservation:** For intermediate stock levels between `L` and `H`, default to cooperation to avoid rapid resource depletion.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(stock, history):
    capacity = 100  # Assuming the maximum capacity is 100 units for calculation purposes
    H = 0.7 * capacity  # High threshold: 70% of capacity
    L = 0.3 * capacity  # Low threshold: 30% of capacity

    if stock < L:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to preserve resource when low

    if stock > H:
        k = min(5, len(history))  # Look at up to the last 5 rounds
        recent_defects = sum(round.defect_count for round in history[-k:]) if history else 0
        total_actions = n * k  # Total possible actions in considered rounds (n is number of players)
        defect_proportion = recent_defects / total_actions if total_actions != 0 else 0

        if defect_proportion < 0.2:
            return 'D'  # Defect to exploit when others are mostly cooperating
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent over-depletion

    return 'C'  # Cooperate when stock is between L and H
```

### Explanation
- **Thresholds:** The high (`H`) and low (`L`) thresholds help determine when to exploit or preserve the resource.
- **Recent Behavior Analysis:** By examining the proportion of defects in recent rounds, the strategy decides whether it's safe to defect without causing rapid depletion.
- **Balanced Approach:** Cooperation is prioritized in intermediate stock levels to sustain the resource, while exploitation occurs cautiously at high levels based on others' behavior.

This approach ensures a balance between exploiting available resources and preserving them for future use by dynamically adjusting based on current conditions and historical data.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting cooperative tendencies of other players while preserving the resource when beneficial. It adapts dynamically based on observed behavior and the current state of the common pool.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 25%):**
   - **Cooperate** in the first round to observe others' actions.
   - Calculate other players' cooperation rates by monitoring their past choices.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - If more than half of other players have Cooperated so far:
     - **Defect** when the current stock is above 75% of capacity, exploiting others' cooperation for higher immediate payoff.
   - Else (if many are Defecting):
     - **Cooperate** to preserve the resource and allow growth.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 25%):**
   - Always **Defect**, as future punishment is limited, maximizing immediate gains.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - After each round, update cooperation rates and adjust strategy based on current stock levels and others' behaviors.
   - If the stock drops significantly below capacity, increase cooperation to prevent depletion.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Start with Cooperate to gather initial data on others' strategies.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Shift towards Cooperating more to allow recovery through growth.
- **High Stock Levels:** Exploit by Defecting if others are Cooperating; preserve by Cooperating if many are Defecting.

### Strategy Explanation:

The strategy balances exploitation and preservation. It exploits players who tend to Cooperate by defecting against them when the stock is high, maximizing immediate gains. Conversely, it preserves the resource when others are defecting, ensuring sustainable consumption for future rounds. The approach dynamically adjusts based on observed behavior and stock levels, optimizing payoff while mitigating risks of complete depletion.

This strategy aims to capitalize on cooperative tendencies while managing resource sustainability, adapting to changing conditions throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_446 = '''
The AI employs a dynamic and adaptive strategy to maximize its payoff by balancing exploitation of others' cooperation with sustainable consumption levels. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Decision Strategy:
1. **Early-Middle Rounds (Remaining Rounds > 5):**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the average number of cooperators (`c_avg`) over the last 3 rounds.
   - **Step 2:** If `c_avg` exceeds 70% of total players and current stock `S` is above 50% of capacity:
     - **Defect** to exploit others' cooperation while ensuring sustainable consumption.
   - **Else:**
     - **Cooperate** to avoid contributing to over-depletion.

2. **Late Rounds (Remaining Rounds ≤ 5):**
   - **Step 1:** If current stock `S` is above 30% of capacity:
     - **Defect** to maximize immediate gains with fewer future rounds.
   - **Else:**
     - **Cooperate** to prevent excessive depletion.

3. **First Round:**
   - **If `S` ≥ 60% of capacity: Defect.**
   - **Else: Cooperate.**

### Summary:
The AI dynamically adjusts its actions based on observed cooperation levels, remaining rounds, and current stock levels. It exploits others' cooperation when sustainable and switches to defecting in late rounds or when the stock is sufficiently high to justify it.

**Answer:**  
The AI's strategy involves exploiting others' cooperation when possible while managing consumption for future sustainability. It defects if cooperation is high and enough rounds remain, otherwise cooperates. In the last few rounds, it defects if resources are sufficient; else, it cooperates. This adaptive approach balances immediate gains with long-term stock health.

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts to various opponent behaviors and game dynamics, follow this structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy balances exploitation with preservation of the common pool resource. It begins conservatively, observes opponent behavior, and dynamically adjusts based on stock levels and future projections.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start by preserving the resource to encourage potential cooperation from others and gather information about their strategies.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Assessment Criteria:**
     - Current stock level relative to capacity.
     - Opponents' actions in previous rounds (defection rate).
     - Projected future stock growth based on current consumption patterns.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment Based on Stock and Behavior:**
   - Calculate the proportion of opponents who defected in the last round (Defection Rate = D_count / n).
   - Determine the threshold for cooperation or defection using a weighted average considering both the current stock and opponents' behavior.
     - Formula: `Threshold = α * Current_Stock + β * Defection_Rate`, where α and β are weights summing to 1.

4. **Action Selection:**
   - If the calculated threshold exceeds a predefined level (indicating either high stock or low defection), defect to exploit higher immediate payoff.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to preserve the resource for future rounds.

5. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** In the last round, there's no future consequence; defecting maximizes immediate payoff regardless of others' actions.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round Adjustment:**
  - If many opponents defect in the first round, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds to exploit while the resource is still abundant.
  
- **Resource Depletion Warning:**
  - If projected stock after consumption and growth is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), prioritize cooperation in the next round to prevent collapse.

### Example Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, history):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'  # Defect in the last round
    
    else:
        # Calculate opponents' defection rate from history
        d_count = sum(history[-1][i] == 'D' for i in range(n) if i != self_index)
        defection_rate = d_count / (n - 1)
        
        # Compute threshold based on current stock and defection rate
        alpha, beta = 0.6, 0.4  # Weights: higher priority to stock level
        threshold = alpha * (current_stock / capacity) + beta * defection_rate
        
        # Determine action based on threshold
        if threshold > 0.5:
            return 'D'  # Exploit by defecting if conditions favor it
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to preserve the resource
            
    # Additional check for critical stock levels
    projected_stock = project_next_stock(current_stock, history)
    if projected_stock < capacity * 0.3:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by cooperating to encourage others and gather information.
- **Dynamic Thresholding:** Adjusts actions based on current stock health and opponents' behavior, exploiting when advantageous.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** Maximizes payoff in the last round without concern for future consequences.
- **Stock Preservation Check:** Cooperates if projections indicate impending resource collapse.

This strategy adapts to varying opponent behaviors while balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_448 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts to various opponent behaviors while maximizing payoff, we structure our approach as follows:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy is adaptive, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability by monitoring stock levels and opponents' actions. It prioritizes exploitation when beneficial and adjusts based on remaining rounds.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Encourages others to cooperate, allowing assessment of their behavior without depleting the stock excessively.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Calculate Proportion of Defectors (PD):** PD = (number of players who Defected last round) / total number of players.
   - **Check Remaining Rounds:** If remaining rounds ≤ 10% of total rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Based on Stock Level (S):**
   - **High Threshold (HT):** S > 70% of capacity.
     - If PD < 30%, Cooperate.
     - Else, Defect to exploit others' exploitation.
   - **Mid Range:** 30% ≤ S ≤ 70% of capacity.
     - If PD > 50%, Defect; else, Cooperate.
   - **Low Threshold (LT):** S < 30% of capacity.
     - Always Defect to maximize remaining stock.

### Edge Cases

- **First Round:** Cooperate to start positively and assess others' behavior.
- **Last Rounds (≤10% remaining):** Always Defect to prioritize immediate gains.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Cooperate if few defect; otherwise, exploit by defecting.
- **Low Stock:** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

### Example Applications

- **All Cooperate:** Strategy Cooperates, maintaining stock sustainability.
- **All Defect:** Strategy defects after S drops below LT, contributing to depletion.
- **Mixed Strategies (e.g., 2C, 2D):** Mid-range S leads to defecting if PD >50%, exploiting the situation.

### Conclusion
This strategy effectively balances exploitation and adaptability by responding to stock levels and opponents' actions. It maximizes payoff while considering long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_449 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance immediate gains against long-term sustainability, adapting to opponents' behaviors. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **First Round:** Defect (D) to test others' behavior and gain higher immediate payoff.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** Use past actions to inform decisions.

2. **Adaptive Play:**
   - Track opponents' cooperation rates. If many defect, consider switching to cooperate to prevent stock collapse.
   - Predict future moves based on opponents' historical data.

3. **Threshold-Based Decisions:**
   - Cooperate if the stock is low or if a high percentage of opponents are cooperating.
   - Defect otherwise, especially against cooperative players.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Always defect (D) since future rounds don't matter.

### Detailed Strategy:
1. **Initial Play:**
   - **Round 1:** Defect to test others' strategies and gain maximum immediate payoff.

2. **Cooperation Rate Thresholds:**
   - If more than 50% of opponents cooperated in the last round, consider defecting again if it doesn't risk stock collapse.
   - If cooperation rates are high (e.g., above 70%), switch to cooperate to sustain the resource.

3. **Stock Level Management:**
   - Monitor current stock level. If it's below a certain threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), prioritize cooperation to prevent depletion.
   - Use logistic growth predictions to anticipate future stock levels and adjust play accordingly.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Adjust thresholds based on observed game dynamics and opponents' strategies over time.
   - Be prepared to switch between C and D depending on the evolving state and opponents' behaviors.

### Example Scenarios:
- **All Defect:** Stock depletes quickly. After noticing, switch to cooperate in later rounds if enough others do too.
- **Mixed Strategies:** Exploit cooperative players while monitoring overall stock health to decide when to defect or cooperate.

### Conclusion:
This strategy exploits immediate opportunities while adapting to maintain long-term sustainability based on opponents' actions and current game state. It balances exploitation with necessary cooperation to maximize payoffs over multiple rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_450 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to adaptively exploit opponents' behaviors while considering the state of the common pool resource. It balances cooperation and defection based on others' actions and the current stock level.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to encourage a cooperative environment and set a positive precedent.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - For each round after the first:
     a. Observe the previous rounds' actions of all other players.
     b. Calculate the Defection Rate (`D_rate`), defined as the proportion of times other players have Defected in the last 5 rounds.
     c. Determine the current stock level as a percentage of capacity (`S_percent = (stock / capacity) * 100`).

     d. Decision Criteria:
         - If `D_rate < 40%` and `S_percent > 75%`: Cooperate to maintain resource sustainability and stable payoffs.
         - Else: Defect to exploit others' behavior or prevent further resource depletion.

3. **Late Game Handling (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - Regardless of other factors, defect in the final rounds to maximize immediate gains since future rounds are limited.

### Edge Cases:

- **Early Depletion:** If stock is very low early due to others' defection, switch to defecting earlier than indicated by `D_rate` and `S_percent`.
- **All Cooperate:** Continue cooperating if all players consistently cooperate to maintain high payoffs and resource levels.

### Strategy Summary:

The strategy starts with cooperation to encourage others. It then adapts based on recent actions of other players and the current stock level, exploiting when others defect or the resource is low. In the late game, it defects to maximize immediate payoffs. This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors and efficiently manages resource exploitation for personal gain.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, other_actions_history, current_stock, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate Defection Rate (D_rate) over last 5 rounds from others
    k = 5
    recent_rounds = other_actions_history[-k:]
    D_count = sum(1 for actions in recent_rounds for action in actions if action == 'D')
    total_actions = len(other_actions_history[0]) * k  # Assuming all players have same history length
    D_rate = D_count / total_actions if total_actions != 0 else 0
    
    S_percent = (current_stock / capacity) * 100
    
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):  # Last 10% of rounds
        return 'D'
    
    if D_rate < 0.4 and S_percent > 75:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy dynamically adapts to the game's evolving state, ensuring maximum exploitation opportunities while maintaining cooperation when beneficial.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_451 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize cumulative payoff while exploiting opponents' strategies without over-depleting the common pool.

---

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Exploration (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Gather information on opponents' initial behavior before making strategic decisions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate opponents' cooperation rate from the previous round.
   - Evaluate current stock level relative to capacity thresholds.

3. **High Stock Level Exploitation (Stock > 70% of Capacity):**
   - If opponents' cooperation rate is high (>60%), defect (D) to exploit their cooperation.
   - Rationale: High cooperation by others allows safe exploitation without rapid resource depletion.

4. **Mid-Stock Level Adjustment (30% < Stock ≤ 70% of Capacity):**
   - Monitor stock trends and opponents' actions:
     - If many cooperate, defect cautiously to avoid over-depletion.
     - If many defect, consider cooperating to prevent further decline.

5. **Low Stock Preservation (Stock ≤ 30% of Capacity):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Preserve the resource to allow regrowth and sustain future payoffs.

6. **Endgame Exploitation (Last 20% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** No future rounds, maximize immediate payoff regardless of stock impact.

---

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Stock Depletion Scenario:**
  - If stock drops rapidly despite high cooperation, switch to Cooperate immediately to preserve and allow regrowth.
  
- **All Players Defecting:**
  - After a round where all defect, initiate cooperation in subsequent rounds to encourage resource recovery.

---

### Adaptation Mechanisms:

- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust thresholds based on observed stock trends and opponents' behavior to balance exploitation and preservation.
- **Smoothing Transitions:** Gradually shift between strategies (e.g., from exploiting to preserving) to avoid abrupt changes that could destabilize the system.

---

**Summary:**

This strategy begins with cooperation, transitions into exploitation when safe, preserves resources when necessary, and defects maximally in the endgame. It adapts dynamically based on stock levels and opponents' actions, aiming to maximize personal payoff while mitigating risks of resource collapse.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_452 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts to opponents' behaviors, we can follow these steps:

### 1. **Initial Round Strategy**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to establish a baseline and observe others' behavior without immediately affecting the stock.

### 2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision Rules**
- **When to Defect:**
  - If most players are cooperating (e.g., >60% cooperation rate in recent rounds), defect (D) to exploit their restraint.
  - If the stock is above a certain threshold and others' defection is high, switch back to C to prevent crashing.

- **When to Cooperate:**
  - If the stock is low (below a defined threshold).
  - If others are defecting excessively, cooperate to sustain the resource.

### 3. **Last Round Strategy**
- **Action:** Defect (D)
- **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds since there are no subsequent impacts.

### 4. **Adaptive Mechanisms**
- **Adjust Exploitation Rate:** Monitor others' cooperation rates and adjust your strategy accordingly.
- **Stock Thresholds:** Use predefined thresholds to decide when to switch between C and D based on the stock level.

### Pseudocode Implementation
```python
def decision(current_round, stock_level, history_coop_rates):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == r:  # Last round
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Define thresholds based on capacity and observed behavior
        low_stock_threshold = capacity * 0.25
        high_coop_threshold = 60  # Percentage

        if stock_level < low_stock_threshold or (history_coop_rates > high_coop_threshold and stock_level > low_stock_threshold):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a baseline, allowing observation of others' strategies.
- **Exploitation When Cooperating:** Takes advantage of those who cooperate by defecting when they are likely to sustain the resource.
- **Sustainability When Defecting:** Switches back to cooperation if others are overexploiting to prevent stock crashes.
- **Last Round Exploitation:** Maximizes immediate gain in the final round without future repercussions.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting dynamically based on opponents' behaviors and current game state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_453 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Exploitation (AE)

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoff by exploiting others while maintaining sustainable stock levels to prevent mutual defection spirals.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to gather information on opponents' behavior and set a baseline for future observations.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the cooperation rate among all players in the previous round.
     - Cooperation Rate = (Number of Cooperators in Previous Round / Total Players)
   - Consider the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If Stock ≥ 0.8 * Capacity:
       - Defect (D) if Cooperation Rate > 0.5; otherwise, Cooperate (C).
     - Else:
       - Cooperate (C) if Cooperation Rate ≤ 0.5; else, consider defecting if stock is not critically low.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - Default to Defect (D) unless the current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 10% of capacity), in which case Cooperate (C) to avoid rapid depletion.
     - Critical Threshold = max(0.1 * Capacity, 1)

### Handling Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to start gathering data on opponents' strategies and stock dynamics.
- **Low Stock Situations:** If the current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), prioritize cooperation to allow stock recovery, even if others are defecting.
- **Stock Recovery Phase:** After a period of low stock, adapt by observing recent cooperation rates before deciding to defect again.

### Exploitative Mindset:

- The strategy exploits opponents who cooperate by defecting when it's safe (i.e., when the stock is sufficiently high) to maximize immediate gains without causing irreversible depletion.
- It adapts dynamically based on observed cooperation trends and current stock levels, preventing mutual defection spirals by cooperating when necessary.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def AE_strategy(history, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = len(history[0])  # Number of players
    capacity = initial_stock  # Given as game parameter
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    prev_cooperate_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C')
    cooperate_rate = prev_cooperate_count / n
    
    stock_threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
    critical_stock_threshold = max(0.2 * capacity, 1)
    late_rounds_threshold = total_rounds - (total_rounds // 5)
    
    if round_number > late_rounds_threshold:
        return 'D' if current_stock >= critical_stock_threshold else 'C'
    
    if current_stock >= stock_threshold_high:
        return 'D' if cooperate_rate > 0.5 else 'C'
    else:
        return 'C' if cooperate_rate <= 0.5 else ('D' if current_stock > critical_stock_threshold else 'C')
```

### Summary:

The AE strategy begins with cooperation to observe opponent behavior, adapts based on the observed cooperation rate and stock levels in subsequent rounds, and defaults to defection in late rounds unless the stock is critically low. This approach balances exploitation with sustainability, aiming to maximize individual payoffs while preventing severe stock depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_454 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for exploiting a resource while balancing immediate gains and sustainable exploitation, we need to consider several factors, including current stock levels, historical cooperation rates among players, and endgame adjustments.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Current Stock Level**: If the current stock is below a certain threshold (s_low), it is necessary to cooperate to preserve the resource for future exploitation.
2. **Historical Cooperation Rates**: If the average proportion of cooperating players in recent rounds exceeds a threshold, defecting can exploit their cooperation for higher immediate gains.
3. **Endgame Adjustment**: As the game nears its end, prioritize defecting more to maximize immediate gains.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Cooperate** if:
   - The current stock is below 20% of capacity (s_low).
   - In the last 5 rounds, the average proportion of cooperating players is less than or equal to 40%.

2. **Defect** otherwise.

3. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last 5 rounds, lower the cooperation threshold to encourage more defecting.

### Final Answer:
The optimal strategy is to cooperate only when necessary to preserve the stock or exploit when others are cooperating. Thus, the final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when stock is low or others aren't; defect otherwise}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_455 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy aims to exploit others' cooperative tendencies while ensuring long-term sustainability by adapting based on their behavior and the current stock level.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate to observe others' initial behavior.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r - k, where k is approximately 10% of total rounds):**
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate among other players in recent rounds (e.g., last 5).
   - If current stock is below a safe threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), Cooperate.
   - Else, if the average cooperation rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%), Defect to exploit others' cooperation.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate to sustain the stock.
3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Stock Depletion:** If stock is low, Cooperate to allow recovery and prevent rapid depletion.
- **Early Rounds:** Cooperate initially to encourage others to Cooperate, then exploit their behavior in subsequent rounds.

### Implementation Outline:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Track cooperation history and stock levels.
   - Set initial safe level (e.g., 25% of capacity) and threshold (e.g., 60%).

2. **Each Round:**
   - Determine if it's the first round, a middle round, or one of the last few rounds.
   - Check current stock against the safe level.
   - Calculate average cooperation rate among others in recent history.
   - Decide action based on thresholds and conditions.

3. **Adaptation:**
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on observed outcomes (e.g., lower threshold if Defection leads to significant stock drops).

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to exploit others' Cooperation while safeguarding against rapid stock depletion when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_456 = '''
To maximize your payoff while balancing exploitation with preservation of the resource, follow this strategy based on the current stock level relative to the total capacity:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Assess Current Stock Level:** Determine the current stock (S) as a percentage of the total capacity.

2. **Set Threshold for Exploitation:** Choose a threshold, such as 60% of capacity. This is the point at which you switch from cooperation to exploitation.

3. **Decision Based on Stock:**
   - If S > 60% of capacity, defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.
   - If S ≤ 60%, cooperate (C) to preserve the resource for future rounds, ensuring sustainable gains.

**Answer:**

$\boxed{D}$ when the current stock is above 60% of capacity; otherwise $\boxed{C}$.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_457 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (Cooperate Phase):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate in the first round to encourage high stock growth and set a cooperative tone.
   - **Rationale:** This phase aims to build trust, allowing others to cooperate longer before defecting.

2. **Mid Rounds (Adaptive Phase):**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:**
     - If current stock > 75% of capacity: Cooperate to maintain high growth potential.
     - If current stock ≤ 75%: Evaluate opponents' behavior.
   - **Opponent Behavior Analysis:**
     - Track the number of opponents defecting in the last 3 rounds.
     - If more than half are defecting, switch to Defecting to exploit their strategy.

3. **Late Rounds (Defect Phase):**
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
   - **Stock Level Check:**
     - If stock is low but still allows gain by defecting, Defect to exploit before potential crash.
     - If stock is very low (near zero), consider Cooperating to avoid wasting an action.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - As rounds progress, adjust the cooperation threshold downward to reflect diminishing returns from cooperation and increasing temptation to defect.

5. **Payoff Consideration:**
   - Calculate immediate payoffs for both actions, considering potential future gains.
   - Choose Defect if it yields higher immediate gain without causing drastic depletion.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, opponent_actions):
    n = number_of_players()
    cooperation_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    recent_rounds_considered = 3

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'

    # Check stock level against threshold
    if current_stock > cooperation_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Count opponent defections in recent rounds
        num_defectors = count_defectors(opponent_actions[-recent_rounds_considered:])
        prop_defecting = num_defectors / n

        # If significant number of opponents are defecting, exploit by defecting
        if prop_defecting >= 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages a cooperative environment, which can be exploited later.
- **Adaptive Defection:** Switches to defection based on observed opponent behavior and stock levels, ensuring exploitation when beneficial.
- **Late Round Exploitation:** Maximizes immediate gains in the final round without regard for future rounds.

This strategy balances immediate gains with strategic adaptation, allowing it to exploit opponents effectively while maintaining robustness across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_458 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing your own payoff while ensuring sustainable exploitation, we propose a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with future considerations. Here's a step-by-step explanation and implementation:

### Approach
1. **Initial Exploitation**: Begin by defecting (D) in the first round to exploit potential cooperation from other players.
2. **Adaptation Based on Stock Levels**: Monitor the stock level after each round. If it falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to cooperating (C) to prevent further depletion.
3. **Observing Others' Behavior**: Track the number of defecting players in recent rounds. If more than half are defecting, switch to cooperation to avoid over-depletion.
4. **Maximizing Last Round Payoff**: In the final round, always defect to maximize immediate gains without worrying about future impacts.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, game_state):
    n = len(game_state.players)  # Total number of players
    capacity = game_state.capacity
    r = game_state.total_rounds
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Get the history of actions for all players up to previous rounds
        history = [player_actions[:-1] for player_actions in game_state.history]
        # Compute average number of Defectors in last k rounds (k=3)
        k = 3
        start_index = max(0, round_number - k - 1)
        recent_history = history[start_index:round_number-2]
        total_defectors = sum([sum(round_actions) for round_actions in recent_history])
        average_defectors = total_defectors / (len(recent_history) * n) if len(recent_history) > 0 else 0
        
        # Get S_remaining from last round
        s_remaining = game_state.history_s[-1]
        
        # Decision criteria
        stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        defection_threshold = 0.5  # More than half defecting
        
        if s_remaining < stock_threshold:
            return 'C'
        elif average_defectors > defection_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Exploitation**: The strategy starts with defecting to exploit others' potential cooperation, aiming for higher immediate payoffs.
- **Stock Level Monitoring**: By tracking the remaining stock after each round, the strategy ensures that resources are not over-depleted. If the stock falls below a critical threshold (50% of capacity), it switches to cooperation to allow recovery.
- **Defector Observation**: The strategy adapts by observing how many players are defecting. If more than half are defecting, switching to cooperation helps preserve the resource for future rounds, preventing a potential collapse.
- **Final Round Maximization**: In the last round, defecting maximizes immediate payoff without considering future impacts since there are no subsequent rounds.

This approach effectively balances exploitation with sustainability, ensuring both immediate gains and long-term resource preservation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_459 = '''
The optimal strategy for maximizing your payoff while considering future sustainability is as follows:

1. **Early Rounds (First 20% of total rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning**: This allows you to observe other players' behavior and build a history, which helps in predicting their future actions.

2. **Middle Rounds (Until the last 20%)**:
   - **Estimate Other Players' Actions**:
     - For each player, calculate their cooperation rate (number of Cs / total rounds so far).
     - Assume players with a cooperation rate below 50% will defect this round.
   - **Calculate Potential Outcomes**:
     - **If Cooperating**: 
       - Payoff: Current stock / (2n)
       - Consumption by others (based on estimated defectors) + your cooperation.
     - **If Defecting**: 
       - Payoff: Current stock / n
       - Consumption by others (estimated defectors) + your defection.
   - **Decision**:
     - If defecting would cause the stock to drop below 40% capacity, cooperate to preserve it.
     - Otherwise, if defecting yields a significantly higher immediate payoff without severe depletion, defect.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of total rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Defect in all these rounds.
   - **Reasoning**: Focus on maximizing immediate gains since the impact on future payoffs is minimal.

**Edge Cases**:
- **First Round**: Cooperate to start building history and avoid over-depleting the resource.
- **Low Stock (Below 40%)**: Prioritize cooperation to allow growth, unless it's among the last few rounds where defecting maximizes immediate payoff.

This strategy balances immediate gains with future sustainability by adjusting actions based on others' behavior and current stock levels.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_460 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing individual payoff by adapting our actions based on others' behavior and the current state of the common pool. The strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable exploitation of the resource.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Exploration (Early Rounds):** 
   - Begin by defecting to test the environment and observe opponents' reactions.
   
2. **Adaptive Exploitation (Middle Rounds):**
   - Monitor the cooperation rate among other players over recent rounds.
     - If most others cooperate, continue defecting to gain higher payoffs.
     - If many defect, switch to cooperating to prevent stock collapse, allowing it to recover for future exploitation.

3. **Maximizing Payoff in Final Rounds:**
   - In the last few rounds, always defect to maximize immediate gains without concern for future rounds.

### Decision Rules:

- **Early Rounds (Rounds 1 to r/4):** Default to defecting to assess others' strategies.
- **Middle Rounds:** Calculate a weighted average of recent cooperation rates. If above a threshold (e.g., 60%), defect; else, cooperate.
- **Last Few Rounds (Last r/4 rounds):** Always defect.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Defect to prioritize immediate payoff and observe others' moves.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to cooperation if stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity) to allow recovery.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, history, current_stock):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = initial_capacity()

    # Early rounds: defect to test others
    if round_number <= total_rounds // 4:
        return 'D'

    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among others
    recent_history = history[-10:] if len(history) > 10 else history
    avg_coop_rate = sum(1 for h in recent_history if h != self and h.action == 'C') / (n-1)

    # Check stock level relative to capacity
    low_stock_threshold = capacity * 0.25
    if current_stock <= low_stock_threshold:
        return 'C'

    # If others are mostly cooperating, defect; else cooperate
    if avg_coop_rate > 0.6:  # Threshold can be adjusted based on testing
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

    # Last few rounds: always defect
    if total_rounds - round_number < total_rounds // 4:
        return 'D'
```

### Exploitative Mindset:

- Exploit cooperative players by defecting when they cooperate, maximizing immediate gains.
- Avoid over-exploitation by switching to cooperation when others defect excessively, preserving the resource for future rounds.

This strategy adapts dynamically, exploiting cooperative behavior while mitigating risks of resource collapse, ensuring robust performance across diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_461 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy aims to maximize payoff while adapting to opponents' behaviors and maintaining sustainable resource use. It balances exploitation with cooperation based on observed trends and current stock levels.

---

### **Decision Rules: When to Cooperate (C) vs Defect (D)**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Start by Cooperating to build a stable stock level and observe opponents' strategies.

2. **Monitor Opponents:**
   - Track each player's actions over time, categorizing them as Cooperators, Defectors, or Mixers.
   - Adjust strategy based on the majority behavior (Cooperate if many are defecting; defect if many are cooperating).

3. **Adaptive Defection:**
   - **If most players (≥60%) are Cooperating:** Defect to exploit their contributions for higher immediate payoff.
   - **If a significant number (≥30%) are Defecting:** Switch to Cooperate to prevent rapid depletion and ensure future gains.

4. **Stock Thresholds:**
   - **High Stock (>75% capacity):** Safely defect as the resource can sustain consumption without immediate risks.
   - **Medium Stock (25%-75% capacity):** Be cautious; if many are defecting, switch to Cooperate to allow recovery.
   - **Low Stock (<25% capacity):** Prioritize Cooperating to enable stock growth and avoid collapse.

5. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of rounds):**
   - Focus on immediate gains: Defect if stock is high; else, Cooperate to secure a share before depletion.

---

### **Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a baseline and encourage others to contribute.
- **Last Round:** Maximize payoff by defecting if the stock is sufficiently high; otherwise, Cooperate to ensure some gain.
- **Stock Collapse Risk:** If defecting would drop the stock below 25%, switch to Cooperate to prevent collapse.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, capacity, n, history):
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to build up the stock
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Track opponent behavior
    cooperators = sum(1 for h in history if h == 'C')
    defectors = len(history) - cooperators
    
    # Determine majority action among opponents
    if defectors > 0.6 * len(history):
        strategy_trend = 'DEFECTING'
    else:
        strategy_trend = 'COOPERATING'
    
    # Check stock thresholds
    if stock_level >= 0.75 * capacity:
        stock_state = 'HIGH'
    elif stock_level <= 0.25 * capacity:
        stock_state = 'LOW'
    else:
        stock_state = 'MEDIUM'
    
    # Adaptive decision-making
    if strategy_trend == 'COOPERATING' and stock_state != 'LOW':
        return 'D'  # Exploit cooperative opponents
    elif defectors >= 0.3 * len(history) or stock_state == 'LOW':
        return 'C'  # Prevent collapse or recover the resource
    else:
        return 'D'  # Default to defecting if conditions are neutral
    
    # Additional check for final rounds
    if round_number > r - (r // 10):
        if stock_level >= 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

# Note: Adjust thresholds and parameters based on specific game dynamics and testing.
```

---

### **Rationale**

- The strategy starts by Cooperating to build a stable resource base, allowing observation of opponents' behaviors.
- It adapts dynamically based on the majority action of opponents and current stock levels, exploiting cooperative players while preventing resource collapse when defecting becomes prevalent.
- By setting clear thresholds for stock levels and opponent behavior, the strategy ensures robustness across various scenarios, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

This approach is designed to exploit opponents' strategies effectively while maintaining adaptability to different game conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_462 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Encourage others to cooperate by maintaining a high stock level, which allows for higher growth and sustainable exploitation in later rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Opponent Behavior:**
     - Track the number of Cooperators (C) and Defectors (D) in recent rounds.
   - **Dynamic Exploitation:**
     - If C > 70% of players, defect to exploit their cooperation.
     - If D increases significantly (>50%), switch back to Cooperate to prevent rapid depletion and allow stock recovery.

3. **Adaptive Thresholds:**
   - **Upper Threshold (e.g., 75% capacity):** Defect when the stock is high and others are cooperating.
   - **Lower Threshold (e.g., 50% capacity):** Switch to Cooperate to encourage growth for future exploitation.

4. **Last Few Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Shift towards Defecting
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoffs as the game approaches its end, with limited concern for future rounds.

5. **Safeguards:**
   - If stock drops below 50%, resume Cooperating to prevent collapse and preserve future exploitation opportunities.
   - Continuously adjust thresholds based on observed depletion rates and opponent behavior patterns.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```
for each round t in 1..r:
    if t == 1 or S < lower_threshold:
        cooperate()
    else if S > upper_threshold and C_count / n > threshold_proportion:
        defect()
    else:
        cooperate()
```

**Rationale:**
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adapting to opponent behavior and stock levels. It exploits cooperation when beneficial, switches to preserve resources when necessary, and maximizes payoffs in the final rounds. This approach ensures robust performance across varying scenarios, exploiting opponents effectively while maintaining resource sustainability for continued gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_463 = '''
To address the problem, we have designed an AI strategy that balances immediate exploitation with sustainable resource management. The strategy employs a threshold-based approach to determine when to defect (exploit) and when to cooperate, ensuring both short-term gains and long-term viability.

### Approach
The strategy is based on the following key components:

1. **Threshold Calculation**: A threshold `T` is determined as 75% of the capacity. This value balances between exploiting the resource when it's abundant and allowing regrowth when it's scarce.
2. **Defection and Cooperation Decision**: The AI defects (exploits) if the current stock `S` exceeds `T`. Otherwise, it cooperates to allow the resource to recover.
3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - In the first round, always defect since the stock is at maximum capacity.
   - In the last round, defect regardless of the stock level to maximize immediate gain.

This approach ensures that the AI maximizes its payoff while maintaining enough resources for future exploitation opportunities.

### Solution Code

```python
class ExploitativeStrategy:
    def __init__(self, n, capacity):
        self.n = n
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # T is set to 75% of capacity
    
    def decision(self, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds):
        if round_number == total_rounds:  # Last round, defect regardless of stock
            return "D"
        elif current_stock > self.threshold:
            return "D"  # Defect when above threshold
        else:
            return "C"  # Cooperate below or equal to threshold
    
    def first_round(self):
        return "D"  # Always defect in the first round

# Example usage:
n = 4
capacity = 100
strategy = ExploitativeStrategy(n, capacity)
print("Threshold:", strategy.threshold)  # Output: Threshold: 75.0
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The strategy initializes with the number of players `n` and the resource capacity. It sets a threshold at 75% of the capacity.
- **Decision Making**:
  - In all rounds except the last, it defects if the current stock exceeds the threshold to exploit the resource. Below or equal to the threshold, it cooperates to allow regrowth.
  - In the last round, it always defects to maximize gains from whatever remains.
- **Edge Cases**: The first round is handled separately to ensure immediate exploitation when the resource is most abundant.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with sustainable practices, ensuring optimal payoff while considering future rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_464 = '''
To address the problem, an adaptive strategy was devised that balances immediate payoff maximization with long-term sustainability. The strategy incorporates checks on current stock levels, trends in stock changes over recent rounds, and opponents' behaviors to decide whether to cooperate or defect.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Immediate Stock Check:** If the current stock is below 70% of capacity, cooperate to prevent further depletion.
2. **Trend Analysis:** Calculate the average stock level over the past three rounds. If the current stock is below this average, indicating a decreasing trend, cooperate to aid recovery.
3. **Opponent Behavior:** Count opponents who have defected in recent rounds. If more than half have defected, cooperate to avoid over-exploitation.
4. **Threshold Adjustment:** Gradually lower the threshold for defecting as the game progresses, encouraging cooperation towards the end.
5. **Edge Cases:** In the first round, defect with a 70% probability. Always cooperate in the last round.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy combines exploitation and sustainability by:

- Cooperating when stock is low or decreasing.
- Defecting when safe, adjusting based on opponents' actions and remaining rounds.
  
This approach maximizes immediate payoffs while preserving resources for future rounds.

\boxed{\text{Adaptive Exploitation with Safeguards}}

description_EXPLOITATIVE_465 = '''
To address the problem of balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability in a repeated game where players can either cooperate or defect, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers past behavior and current resource levels. The goal is to maximize individual payoff while preventing resource collapse.

### Approach
1. **Initial Exploration**: Start by defecting to observe how other players respond.
2. **Behavior Estimation**: Track the cooperation rates of opponents over time to predict their likely actions in future rounds.
3. **Impact Assessment**: Calculate the expected impact on the current stock if you choose to defect or cooperate, considering both immediate gains and potential future losses due to resource depletion.
4. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: Use a dynamic threshold based on the current stock level relative to capacity to decide whether defecting is safe (i.e., it doesn't bring the stock below a critical level necessary for sustainable growth).

### Explanation
- **Initial Exploration**: The strategy starts by defecting in the first round to gather information about other players' behavior.
- **Behavior Estimation**: By analyzing past rounds, the strategy estimates how likely opponents are to cooperate. This helps predict future interactions and adjust the strategy accordingly.
- **Impact Assessment**: For each potential action (defect or cooperate), the strategy calculates how it affects the current stock level. If defecting is predicted to deplete the resource below a sustainable threshold, cooperation is chosen instead.
- **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: A dynamic safe threshold ensures that defecting does not jeopardize future rounds by allowing the resource to recover adequately.

This approach adaptively balances between exploiting immediate gains and ensuring long-term sustainability, making it robust against various player behaviors and resource dynamics.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_466 = '''
To address the problem of sustainably exploiting a shared resource, the optimal strategy is a balanced approach that adapts based on the state of the resource. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to help establish a stable base for the resource.

2. **Monitor Resource Levels**: For each subsequent round, compare the current stock level with the stock from the previous round.

3. **Exploit When Stable or Growing**: If the current stock is greater than or equal to the previous round's stock, it indicates that others are maintaining or increasing the resource. In this case, Defect (exploit) to gain higher immediate payoffs.

4. **Cooperate When Declining**: If the current stock is less than the previous round's stock, it means too many are Exploiting, leading to depletion. Switch to Cooperating to help replenish the resource for future sustainability.

This strategy ensures that you maximize your payoffs while contributing to the long-term health of the shared resource.

**Answer:**

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when the current stock is lower than the previous round's stock; defect otherwise.}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_467 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategic approach that balances exploitation with sustainability based on the current stock level and the behavior of other players. Here's a structured summary of the decision rules:

### Decision Rules for Exploitative Strategy

1. **Initial Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate.
     - This sets a baseline to observe others' behaviors.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Evaluate the current stock level and the proportion of cooperators from the last round to decide the action.

3. **Stock Level Thresholds**:
   - **Low Stock (Below 20% Capacity)**: Cooperate.
     - Aims to prevent resource collapse by contributing to recovery.
   - **High Stock (Above 80% Capacity)**: Defect.
     - Exploit the abundance of resources while it's sustainable.

4. **Proportion of Cooperators (p_C) from Last Round**:
   - If **p_C > 70%**: Defect.
     - Leverage others' cooperation to exploit the resource.
   - If **p_C < 30%**: Cooperate.
     - Contribute to preventing further depletion when many defect.

5. **Middle Range (Stock between 20% and 80%)**:
   - Default to Defect if p_C is neither too high nor too low, encouraging others to cooperate more by exploiting their efforts.

### Summary of the Approach

- **Exploitation**: Prioritize defecting when the stock is high or when a significant majority of players are cooperating, maximizing personal gain.
- **Sustainability**: Cooperate when the stock is critically low or when most players are defecting, ensuring the resource doesn't collapse entirely and preserving it for potential future gains.

This strategy adaptively balances between short-term exploitation and long-term sustainability, optimizing individual benefits while considering collective resource management.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_468 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Choose to Defect (D) to gain higher immediate payoff and test opponents' reactions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the proportion of Cooperators (p_C_prev) from the previous round.
   - If the current stock (S) is above a threshold (e.g., 0.6 * capacity):
     - If p_C_prev ≥ exploit_threshold (e.g., 0.5), choose to Defect (D) to exploit cooperation among others.
     - Else, choose to Cooperate (C) to encourage more cooperation and avoid resource collapse.
   - If S ≤ threshold:
     - Choose to Cooperate (C) to preserve the stock and promote sustainability.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Always choose to Defect (D) since future rounds do not matter, maximizing immediate payoff.

**Dynamic Adjustments:**
- Monitor stock trends over time. If the stock consistently remains high, increase exploit aggressiveness by lowering the exploit_threshold.
- If the stock shows signs of depletion or trend downward, switch to a more cooperative approach to aid recovery.

This strategy balances exploiting opponents' cooperation with preserving the common pool for sustainable gains, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior and resource state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_469 = '''
To maximize individual payoff while considering system sustainability, follow this strategy:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Assess Current Stock (S):** Observe the current level of the shared resource.

2. **Determine Threshold:** Set a fixed threshold at 60% of the total capacity (C). That is, defect if S ≥ 0.6*C.

3. **Make Decision:**
   - If S ≥ 0.6*C: Defect by consuming S/n.
   - Else: Cooperate by consuming S/(2n).

**Answer:**

Defect when the current stock is at least 60% of the total capacity, otherwise cooperate. This balance aims to maximize personal gain while allowing the resource to recover and sustain future harvests.

$\boxed{\text{Defect if the current stock is at least }60\%\text{ of the capacity; otherwise, cooperate.}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_470 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Maintain a sustainable resource base by starting with moderate consumption, allowing the stock to potentially recover and grow.

2. **Mid-Game Adjustment:**
   - **Monitor Opponents' Behavior:** Track the number of players defecting versus cooperating.
     - If most players are defecting, increase your own defection frequency to exploit higher immediate payoffs.
     - If cooperation is prevalent, maintain a balance between defection for gain and cooperation to sustain the resource.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Strategy:**
   - **Threshold:** 70% of capacity.
     - **Above Threshold (S > 0.7 * Capacity):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as the stock can recover sufficiently.
     - **Below Threshold (S ≤ 0.7 * Capacity):** Cooperate to preserve the resource and prevent rapid depletion.

4. **End-Game Strategy (Approaching Round r):**
   - **Action:** Shift towards Defecting
   - **Rationale:** Prioritize immediate gains in the final rounds as there are no future rounds to be affected by stock depletion.

5. **Adjustments Based on Opponents:**
   - If opponents consistently defect, increase defection frequency.
   - If cooperation is widespread, adjust defection to exploit without causing severe resource depletion.

6. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a sustainable base.
   - **Last Round (Round r):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff with no future repercussions.
   - **Low Stock Situations:** If stock is very low, defect cautiously to avoid drastic depletion but prioritize higher immediate gains.

This strategy balances exploitation of immediate payoffs with the sustainability needed for long-term gains, adapting dynamically based on opponents' behaviors and current resource levels.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_471 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (Cooperation Phase):**
   - In the first few rounds, Cooperate to observe opponents' behaviors and gather data on their strategies.

2. **Observation and Adaptation:**
   - Monitor the number of Cooperators (C) and Defectors (D) in each round.
   - If a significant proportion of players are Cooperating, continue Cooperating to sustain the resource and encourage mutual benefit.
   - If many players start Defecting, adapt by switching to Defect to exploit the situation and maximize immediate gains.

3. **Defection Trigger:**
   - Switch to Defect when the number of Defectors exceeds a certain threshold or when the stock level drops below a critical point (e.g., half of capacity).

4. **Final Rounds Handling:**
   - In the last few rounds, prioritize maximizing payoffs by defecting since future consequences are negligible.

5. **Low Stock Adjustment:**
   - If the current stock is significantly depleted, switch to Defect to capitalize on remaining resources before potential exhaustion.

# Example usage in a tournament setting

1. **Initial Move:**
   - Defect in the first round to test other players' responses and gather initial data on their strategies.

2. **Tracking Cooperation Rates:**
   - Maintain a record of each player's cooperation rate over time, updating this information after each round based on observed actions.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment Based on Stock Level:**
   - If the stock is above 70% of capacity, prioritize defecting against players with higher cooperation rates to exploit their tendency to cooperate.
   - When the stock falls below 70%, switch to a cooperative strategy to preserve the resource and prevent collapse.

4. **Final Rounds Strategy:**

                if cooperation_rates[i] > threshold_cooperate:
                    action_i = D
                else:
                    action_i = C

            # Preserve resource
            action = C
            
    execute action
```

This strategy dynamically adapts to exploit cooperative players while preserving the resource when necessary, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of total rounds):**
   - Start with cooperation to encourage others to cooperate, setting a cooperative tone and gathering information about opponents' strategies.

2. **Mid Game (Middle 60% of total rounds):**
   - Monitor the number of defecting players:
     - If most players are cooperating, exploit by defecting more often to gain higher payoffs.
     - If there's significant defection, switch back to cooperation to preserve the stock and prevent rapid depletion.

3. **End Game (Last 20% of total rounds):**
   - Shift towards increased defection as future rounds are limited, focusing on maximizing short-term gains without concern for long-term sustainability.

4. **Stock Level Threshold:**
   - Establish a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity) to decide between cooperation and defection.
     - If stock is above the threshold, defect more often.
     - Below the threshold, cooperate to allow growth and prevent collapse.

**Decision Rules Pseudocode:**

```python
def decision(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, opponents_actions):
    threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    early_rounds = total_rounds * 0.2
    end_rounds = total_rounds - (total_rounds * 0.2)
    
    if round_number <= early_rounds:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in early rounds to encourage others and gather info
    
    elif early_rounds < round_number < end_rounds:
        num_defectors = sum(1 for action in opponents_actions if action == 'D')
        
        if current_stock > threshold:
            if num_defectors / n >= 0.7:  # Most are defecting
                return 'C'  # Cooperate to preserve stock
            else:
                return 'D'  # Exploit by defecting
        
        else:  # Stock is low
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to allow growth
    
    else:  # Last few rounds, focus on maximizing payoff
        return 'D'  # Defect as much as possible
```

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Always cooperate to set a cooperative tone and observe opponents.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Increase defection to maximize short-term gains.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate to prevent collapse and allow growth.

This strategy balances exploitation with preservation, adapting to opponents' behaviors while ensuring long-term sustainability when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_474 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that maximizes individual payoff while considering the impact of actions on future rounds, we can follow these decision rules:

### Decision Rules

1. **Early Rounds Exploitation**:
   - In the initial rounds (e.g., first half), defect to gain higher immediate payoffs.
   - This takes advantage of others who might also be exploiting the resource or cooperating.

2. **Stock Threshold Monitoring**:
   - Set an adaptive threshold for stock level, initially at 75% of capacity.
   - If the current stock (S) is above this threshold, continue defecting to exploit the abundance.
   - If S drops below the threshold, switch to cooperation to help replenish the resource and prevent collapse.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**:
   - As rounds progress, lower the threshold dynamically based on remaining rounds.
   - For example, in round t of r total rounds, adjust the threshold to capacity * (1 - 0.25*(t/r)), allowing more exploitation as the game nears its end.

4. **Last Round Exploitation**:
   - In the final round, defect regardless of stock level since there's no future payoff consideration.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round**: Defect to maximize immediate gain.
- **Last Round**: Defect to exploit any remaining resource without concern for future rounds.
- **High Stock Levels**: Continue defecting until S drops below the threshold to maintain high payoffs.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Cooperate to allow regrowth and sustain some payoff in subsequent rounds.

### Strategy Summary

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by exploiting others' cooperation when the resource is abundant. It switches to cooperation as the stock depletes, ensuring the resource doesn't collapse entirely. This approach adapts dynamically based on observed stock levels and remaining rounds, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
function decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    threshold = calculate_threshold(total_rounds, current_round)
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return D
    elif current_stock > threshold:
        return D
    else:
        return C
    
def calculate_threshold(total_rounds, current_round):
    initial_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    remaining_ratio = (current_round / total_rounds)
    adjusted_threshold = initial_threshold - (initial_threshold * 0.25) * remaining_ratio
    return max(adjusted_threshold, 0.3 * capacity)
```

This strategy ensures a balance between exploitation and sustainability, maximizing individual payoff while considering the collective impact on the resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_475 = '''
To maximize your own payoff in each round, you should consistently choose the action that gives the highest immediate reward. This leads to the following strategy:

**Always Defect**

By defecting in every round, you ensure that you receive the higher payoff of \( \frac{S}{n} \) each time, where \( S \) is the current stock and \( n \) is the number of players. While this approach may lead to a quicker depletion of the resource, it prioritizes maximizing your immediate gains without concern for long-term sustainability or the impact on other players.

**Answer:**
\boxed{\text{Always defect}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_476 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with future sustainability in a repeated interaction scenario, we propose an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts between cooperation and defection based on observed stock levels and historical trends.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set an initial threshold \( T_0 \) as 80% of the capacity (e.g., \( T_0 = 0.8 \times \text{capacity} \)).
   - Monitor stock changes over each round to adaptively adjust this threshold.

2. **Each Round (from 1 to r):**
   a. **First Round:**
      - Choose Defect (\( D \)) to maximize immediate payoff.
   b. **Last Round (r):**
      - Choose Defect (\( D \)) since there's no future consequence.
   c. **Middle Rounds:**
      i. Observe the current stock \( S \).
      ii. If \( S \geq T \), choose Defect (\( D \)).
      iii. Else, choose Cooperate (\( C \)) to preserve remaining stock.

3. **Threshold Adjustment Mechanism:**
   - After each round, calculate the change in stock (\( \Delta S = S_{\text{current}} - S_{\text{previous}} \)).
   - If \( \Delta S \) is negative (indicating depletion), reduce \( T \) for future rounds to encourage cooperation sooner.
   - If \( \Delta S \) is positive or stable, keep or slightly increase \( T \).

### Explanation:

- **First Round:** By defecting initially, we exploit the potential of others cooperating, maximizing immediate payoff.
- **Middle Rounds:** The adaptive threshold \( T \) ensures that we defect when the stock is sufficiently high (allowing for future replenishment) and switch to cooperation if the stock drops, preventing rapid depletion.
- **Last Round:** Since there's no future impact, defecting maximizes final gains.

This strategy balances exploitation of others' cooperation with preservation of resources for future rounds, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior trends.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoffs by exploiting opponents' behavior while managing the common pool resource sustainably. It adapts based on opponents' actions and the current stock level.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Round):**
   - Cooperate to gather information about opponents' strategies without triggering immediate retaliations.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Track each opponent's cooperation rate.
   - Mark an opponent as a defector if their defection rate exceeds 30% of past rounds.
   - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity and fewer than half of opponents are defecting, cooperate.
   - Otherwise, defect to exploit identified defectors or prevent resource depletion.

3. **Last Few Rounds:**
   - Defect in the final two rounds to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, opponent_actions):
    n = number_of_players()
    cooperation_threshold = 0.3  # Opponent defects > 30% of the time
    low_stock_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    last_rounds_to_defect = 2

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Calculate each opponent's cooperation rate
    defector_count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i != self_index:  # Exclude self
            total_actions = len(opponent_actions[i])
            cooperation_rate = sum(1 for a in opponent_actions[i] if a == 'C') / total_actions
            if cooperation_rate < cooperation_threshold:
                defector_count += 1

    # Check stock level and decide action
    if current_stock > low_stock_threshold and defector_count <= n/2:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

    # In last few rounds, always defect
    if round_number >= r - last_rounds_to_defect + 1:
        return 'D'
```

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to encourage others and gather initial data.
- **Low Stock:** Cooperate unless exploiting defectors yields higher immediate gains without depleting the resource too much.
- **Last Rounds:** Defect to maximize payoffs since future rounds are irrelevant.

---

### **Rationale:**

The strategy balances exploitation with cooperation. By defecting against identified defectors and cooperating when the stock is healthy, it maximizes personal gain while preventing excessive resource depletion. Adapting dynamically ensures robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_478 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game where players observe past actions, we can use an adaptive strategy based on opponents' cooperation rates and the current state of the shared resource. Here's a structured approach:

### Approach
1. **Initial Strategy**: Start by cooperating to establish a baseline and observe how other players behave.
2. **Early Game Strategy**:
   - If the stock is high (above 75% capacity) and most opponents have cooperated in previous rounds, defect to exploit the situation for higher immediate payoffs.
   - If the stock is very low (below 25%), cooperate to help replenish the resource.
   - If fewer than 30% of opponents have cooperated in past rounds, cooperate to avoid rapid depletion.
   - Otherwise, defect if conditions don't meet the above criteria.
3. **Late Game Strategy**:
   - As the game progresses into its final 25%, prioritize defecting more often to maximize immediate payoffs since future gains are limited.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(opponents_actions, stock, round_number, total_rounds, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        # Initial round: Cooperate
        return 'C'
    
    n = len(opponents_actions) + 1  # Including self
    prev_cooperate_count = sum(1 for actions in opponents_actions.values() 
                              for action in actions if action == 'C')
    total_prev_rounds = (round_number - 1) * (n - 1)
    cooperation_rate = prev_cooperate_count / total_prev_rounds if total_prev_rounds != 0 else 0.5
    
    early_game = round_number <= 0.75 * total_rounds
    
    if early_game:
        if stock > 0.75 * capacity and cooperation_rate > 0.6:
            return 'D'
        elif stock < 0.25 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif cooperation_rate < 0.3:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        if stock < 0.25 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round**: The strategy starts by cooperating to set a baseline and observe opponents' behaviors.
- **Cooperation Rate Tracking**: By tracking how often opponents have cooperated in past rounds, the strategy adapts dynamically. A high cooperation rate among opponents suggests an opportunity to defect for higher payoffs.
- **Stock Level Consideration**: The strategy considers the current stock level relative to capacity. High stock allows more aggressive exploitation, while low stock prompts cooperation to replenish resources.
- **Late Game Adjustment**: In the final stages of the game, the strategy shifts towards maximizing immediate gains by defecting more frequently.

This approach balances short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed opponent behavior and current resource levels.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_479 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy should adapt based on opponents' actions and the game's state.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff by exploiting others while maintaining resource sustainability when necessary.

#### 1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Reasoning:** Encourages other players to cooperate, preserving the stock for future gains.

#### 2. **Mid Game:**
   - **Observation:** Monitor the number of defecting players each round.
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If fewer than 30% of players defect in the previous round:
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - **Reasoning:** Exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate payoff without significant resource depletion.
     - If more than 30% of players defect:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - **Reasoning:** Prevents rapid resource depletion, preserving it for future rounds.

#### 3. **Late Game (Last few rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - **Reasoning:** No incentive to preserve the stock as the game is nearing its end.

#### 4. **Stock Level Check:**
   - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity:
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
       - **Reasoning:** Low stock levels are vulnerable; cooperation helps in recovery or slower depletion.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(history, round_number, player_index):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    current_stock = get_current_stock()

    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate initially to encourage others

    if round_number > r - 2:  # Last few rounds
        return 'D'  # Defect as no future rounds to punish

    # Calculate opponent defection rate
    last_round_defectors = count_defectors(history, round_number)
    defection_rate = last_round_defectors / n

    if current_stock < capacity * 0.5:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to preserve stock

    if defection_rate > 0.3:  # If many defect, cooperate
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'  # Exploit others by defecting
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by cooperating to encourage a cooperative environment.
- **Adaptive Defection/Cooperation:** Monitors opponents' behavior. If most cooperate, defects for higher payoff; if too many defect, cooperates to prevent stock collapse.
- **Late Game Exploitation:** Shifts to defecting in the final rounds as there's no future penalty for depleting the resource.
- **Stock Preservation:** Cooperates when the stock is low to avoid rapid depletion and potential long-term loss of gains.

This strategy balances short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on opponents' actions and the game's state.

**Exploitative Strategy Design for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' strategies while maintaining a balance that preserves the common pool's sustainability.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to maintain a high stock level, enabling higher payoffs in later rounds when defecting is possible without causing immediate depletion.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 60% of total rounds):**
   - **Assessment:** Monitor the proportion of cooperators among other players.
     - If more than 50% of other players cooperate, **Defect** to gain higher immediate payoff while leveraging their cooperative behavior to sustain stock levels.
     - If less than 50% cooperate, consider **Cooperate** to prevent rapid depletion and encourage others to cooperate.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of total rounds):**
   - **Assessment:** Evaluate the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If stock is above 80% capacity: **Defect** to maximize immediate gains before the game ends.
     - If stock is between 50% and 80%:
       - If more than 60% of other players are defecting, switch to **Cooperate** to allow stock growth for potential future rounds.
       - Otherwise, continue **Defecting** as others' cooperation maintains sufficient stock.
     - If stock is below 50%: **Cooperate** to promote growth and ensure sustainable payoffs in any remaining rounds.

4. **Adaptive Adjustment:**
   - Each round, reassess the proportion of cooperators among other players.
   - If more than 70% are defecting, switch to **Cooperate** to prevent stock depletion and encourage others to follow suit.
   - Conversely, if cooperation rates exceed 60%, exploit by **Defecting**.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to establish a high initial stock level, fostering potential for higher payoffs in subsequent rounds.
  
- **Last Few Rounds (Final 10% of total rounds):**
   - If stock is above 70%, continue **Defecting** to maximize immediate gains.
   - If below 70%, switch to **Cooperate** if others are defecting, encouraging mutual cooperation for sustainable growth.

**Implementation Notes:**

- The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the current stock level and recent history of other players' actions, ensuring adaptability to varying opponent behaviors.
- Thresholds (e.g., 50% cooperation rate, 80% stock capacity) are adjustable parameters that can be fine-tuned for optimal performance in different game scenarios.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, others_actions):
    # Initial phase: Cooperate to build up stock
    if round_number <= 0.2 * total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Middle phase: Exploit others' cooperation
    elif round_number <= 0.8 * total_rounds:
        cooperator_proportion = sum(1 for action in others_actions if action == 'C') / len(others_actions)
        if cooperator_proportion > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    # Late phase: Preserve stock if necessary
    else:
        if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock < 0.8 * capacity:
            defector_proportion = 1 - cooperator_proportion
            if defector_proportion > 0.7:

**Conclusion:**

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on the game's state and opponents' behaviors. It aims to exploit others' cooperative tendencies while adapting to prevent mutual ruin, ensuring robust performance across a wide range of scenarios.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Build a cooperative image to observe opponents' behaviors without depleting resources early.

2. **Mid-Game (Middle 60% of rounds):**
   - **Cooperation Rate Assessment:**
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate of each opponent based on past actions.
     - Identify high cooperators (above 80%) and low cooperators (below 50%).

   - **Stock Prediction:**
     - Estimate next round's stock using current state and projected consumption:
       - Predicted Stock = min(S_remaining + 2*S_remaining*(1 - S_remaining/capacity), capacity)
     - If predicted stock is above 70% of capacity, defect against high cooperators.
     - Else, cooperate to allow recovery.

   - **Dynamic Adjustment:**
     - If many are defecting (opponent cooperation < 50%), increase own cooperation by 20% to sustain stock.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds as the game is nearing conclusion.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to start with a full stock.
   - **Low Stock (below 30% capacity):** Always cooperate to prevent depletion and allow recovery.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize payoff regardless of future impact.

5. **Trust Metrics:**
   - Track each opponent's cooperation history.
   - Exploit high cooperators by defecting; adjust strategy towards low cooperators by cooperating more.

6. **Incentive Structure:**
   - Balance immediate gains from defecting against long-term sustainability to prevent stock crashes.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

**Explanation:**

This strategy starts by cooperating to gather information and maintain a sustainable resource level. In mid-game, it adapts based on opponents' behaviors, exploiting those who cooperate while protecting against those defecting. Towards the end, it defects maximally for immediate gains. The approach dynamically adjusts using stock predictions and trust metrics, ensuring adaptability across varying opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_482 = '''
The exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize individual payoff by adapting to opponents' behavior and the current game state. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Defection**: Start with defecting (D) in the first round to test opponents' responses.
2. **Adaptive Defection Threshold**: Monitor opponents' actions and the stock level. Use a threshold to decide between cooperation (C) or defection (D).
3. **Stock Dynamics Awareness**: Adjust strategies based on the current stock level and its trend to prevent rapid depletion or exploit resource abundance.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Always defect in the last round for maximum payoff without future repercussions.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Defect (D) to assess opponents' tendencies.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If the stock is high and opponents are mostly cooperating, defect to exploit higher immediate payoffs.
  - If a significant number of opponents defect, continue defecting to maximize short-term gains.
  - If the stock is low or decreasing rapidly, consider cooperating temporarily to prevent collapse and sustain the resource for potential future exploitation.
- **Last Round**: Defect (D) as there are no future rounds to consider.

### Thresholds:
- Use a defection rate threshold (e.g., above 30% defecting opponents) to decide strategy. If exceeded, increase defection likelihood; otherwise, cooperate to sustain the resource.

### Pseudocode:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate defection rate from history
        recent_defections = sum(1 for action in history[-5:] if action == 'D')
        defection_rate = recent_defections / len(history[-5:]) if history else 0
        
        # Check stock level and growth trend
        current_stock = stock
        stock_trend = calculate_growth_trend(history)
        
        if defection_rate > 0.3 or current_stock > capacity * 0.8:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Calculate potential payoffs for C and D
            payoff_c = current_stock / (2*n)
            payoff_d = current_stock / n
            
            # Check if defecting leads to significantly higher payoff without causing collapse
            estimated_next_stock = calculate_next_stock(current_stock, [payoff_d]*n)
            
            if payoff_d > payoff_c + 0.1*payoff_c and estimated_next_stock > capacity * 0.2:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Defection**: Tests opponents' strategies, potentially exploiting those who cooperate.
- **Adaptive Threshold**: Adjusts based on recent defection rates to exploit or sustain the resource.
- **Stock Dynamics**: Considers the impact of current actions on future rounds, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

This strategy is designed to maximize personal payoff by adapting dynamically to game state and opponents' behaviors, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.

To address the problem of balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability in a cooperative setting, an effective strategy has been devised. This strategy adapts based on the observed behavior of other players and the current state of the shared resource.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase:**
   - For the first 2-3 rounds, always choose to Cooperate (C). This phase allows others to observe cooperation, potentially encouraging them to follow suit, thereby fostering a cooperative environment.

2. **Observation and Adaptation:**
   - From subsequent rounds onwards, monitor two key factors:
     - **Proportion of Defectors:** Calculate the number of players who chose Defect (D) in the previous round relative to the total number of players.
     - **Current Stock Level:** Check the current level of the shared resource.

3. **Decision-Making Logic:**
   - If fewer than 30% of players defected in the previous round and the stock is above 70% of its capacity:
     - Choose to Defect (D). Exploit others' cooperation while the resource remains robust.
   - If more than 60% of players defected or if the stock falls below 50% of capacity:
     - Choose to Cooperate (C). This helps prevent further depletion and allows for potential recovery of the resource.
   - For intermediate scenarios where the proportion of defectors is between 30% and 60%, and the stock level is between 50% and 70% of capacity:
     - Examine the trend in stock levels:
       - If the stock is increasing compared to the previous round, choose to Defect (D) as growth can sustain higher consumption.
       - If the stock is decreasing, switch to Cooperate (C) to aid recovery.

4. **Final Rounds Strategy:**
   - In the last 2-3 rounds:
     - If fewer than half of the players defected in the previous round and the stock remains above 60% of capacity, choose to Defect (D) once more for a final gain.
     - Otherwise, choose to Cooperate (C) to ensure some payoff in the concluding rounds.

**Conclusion:**

This strategy effectively balances exploitation and sustainability by adapting to others' actions and the resource's state. It begins with cooperation to encourage a collaborative environment, then shifts based on observed defection rates and stock levels, ensuring long-term viability while capturing short-term benefits when feasible.

### Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game

The goal of this strategy is to maximize your own payoff by exploiting the behavior of other players while adapting to the dynamic state of the common pool resource. The strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, leveraging information about past actions and the current stock level.

---

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Defect** if you have no prior information.
     - Defection is advantageous in the first round because:
       - It gives a higher payoff compared to cooperation.
       - It signals strength and may influence other players' future behavior.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Analyze the distribution of actions (C/D) from the previous round.
   - **If most players cooperated** (e.g., more than 50% of players chose C):
     - **Defect** to exploit their cooperation:
       - You gain a higher payoff while others contribute less to depleting the stock.
       - This creates an incentive for other players to defect in future rounds, disrupting potential cooperation.
   - **If most players defected** (e.g., more than 50% of players chose D):
     - **Cooperate**:
       - Cooperating preserves the stock and prevents rapid depletion, which benefits all players in subsequent rounds.
       - This behavior may encourage other players to cooperate or at least reduce their defection rates.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Final 1-2 rounds):**
   - Focus on maximizing immediate payoff without concern for long-term sustainability:
     - **Defect** if the stock is high enough to sustain consumption:
       - High stock levels mean defecting will not immediately deplete the resource.
     - **Cooperate** if the stock is low to avoid rapid depletion and ensure some payoff.

4. **Stock Dynamics:**
   - Monitor the stock level after each round:
     - If the stock is near capacity (high), prioritize **defection** to maximize your payoff.
     - If the stock is near zero (low), switch to **cooperation** to preserve what remains.

---

### Edge Cases

1. **First Round:**
   - No prior history, so defecting is the safest exploitative choice.
   - Example: In a game with n=4 and capacity=100, defecting gives you 25 per round while others may get less if they cooperate.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Exploit the lack of future consequences:
     - Defect unconditionally to maximize your payoff in the final round.
     - Example: If the stock is high (e.g., >70% of capacity), defecting will still leave enough for minimal growth, but you gain more immediately.

3. **Low Stock Levels:**
   - If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., <25% of capacity):
     - Switch to cooperation to avoid depleting it further.
     - This prevents a complete collapse of the resource in subsequent rounds.

4. **High Stock Levels:**
   - If the stock is above 75% of capacity:
     - Defect to take advantage of the abundance, knowing that growth will replenish the resource.

---

### Exploitative Mindset

1. **Exploit Cooperation:**
   - When other players cooperate, defect to gain a larger share of the resource while contributing less to its depletion.
   - This creates a cycle where cooperation is incentivized only if others are also cooperating, but you can break that cycle by defecting.

2. **Encourage Defection:**
   - By defecting when most players cooperate, you incentivize other players to defect in future rounds, disrupting potential coordination and creating instability in the system.
   - This makes it harder for other players to sustain cooperation, allowing you to exploit their behavior over time.

3. **Adapt to Opponent Behavior:**
   - If opponents are consistently cooperating, continue defecting to maximize your payoff.
   - If opponents start defecting more, switch to cooperation to preserve the resource and ensure long-term gains.

4. **Balance Immediate and Future Payoffs:**
   - Defect when it is safe (high stock levels) to maximize immediate payoff.
   - Cooperate when necessary (low stock levels) to prevent rapid depletion and sustain future payoffs.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(stock, history):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return "D"  # Defect in the first round to exploit potential cooperation
    
    previous_actions = history[-1]
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions.values() if action == "D")
    
    if num_defectors / n > 0.5:
        # Most players defected last round; cooperate to preserve the resource
        return "C"
    else:
        # Exploit cooperation by defecting
        return "D"
    
    # Edge case for final rounds
    if current_round >= r - 1:
        return "D"  # Defect in the final rounds to maximize immediate payoff
    
    # Adjust based on stock level
    if stock < capacity * 0.25:
        return "C"  # Cooperate to avoid depleting a low stock
    elif stock > capacity * 0.75:
        return "D"  # Defect when the stock is high and sustainable
    
    # Default behavior based on previous actions
    if num_defectors / n > 0.5:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"
```

---

### Summary

This strategy is designed to exploit the behavior of other players while adapting to the dynamic state of the common pool resource. By defecting when others cooperate and cooperating when necessary to preserve the stock, you can maximize your own payoff over time while disrupting potential coordination among opponents. The strategy is robust because it does not rely on specific patterns or assumptions about opponent behavior but instead adapts based on observed actions and stock levels.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_485 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for this Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance between maximizing immediate payoffs and ensuring sustainable resource management for future rounds. The strategy should be adaptive, robust, and exploit opponents' behavior without relying on specific coordination mechanisms.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

The strategy uses a threshold-based approach that adapts to the current state of the common pool (stock level) and the observed behavior of other players. The decision rules are as follows:

#### **Early Rounds: Exploration Phase**
- In the first 20% of rounds, cooperate (C) to:
  - Establish baseline cooperation.
  - Observe opponent behavior and stock dynamics.

#### **Middle Rounds: Exploitation Phase**
- After the exploration phase, decide between C or D based on the following thresholds:
  - **Cooperate** if:
    - Stock is above 70% of capacity (i.e., S ≥ 0.7 × capacity).
    - At least 50% of opponents have cooperated in the last round.
  - **Defect** otherwise.

#### **Late Rounds: Conservation Phase**
- In the last 10% of rounds:
  - Always cooperate (C) to maximize payoffs without depleting the stock for non-existent future rounds.

---

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**

#### **First Round**
- Cooperate (C). This helps establish a baseline and provides information about opponent behavior.

#### **Last Few Rounds**
- In the last 10% of rounds, always cooperate (C). There is no incentive to defect in these rounds since future payoffs are irrelevant.

#### **Stock Collapse**
- If stock drops below 20% of capacity:
  - Cooperate (C) for at least two consecutive rounds to allow stock recovery.
  - Defect (D) only if stock recovers above 30% and opponents are defecting.

---

### **3. Exploitative Mindset**

The strategy exploits opponents by:
1. **Taking advantage of cooperators**: If other players cooperate, defect to gain higher payoffs while letting others maintain the resource.
2. **Adapting to defectors**: If most players defect, switch back to cooperating to preserve the stock and avoid a "tragedy of the commons."
3. **Capitalizing on short-term greed**: Exploit opponents' tendency to defect in later rounds by cooperating strategically to maximize long-term payoffs.

---

### **4. Pseudocode**

```python
def strategy(history, state):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    stock = state.stock

    # Early exploration phase (first 20% of rounds)
    if current_round <= 0.2 * r:
        return 'C'

    # Late conservation phase (last 10% of rounds)
    elif current_round > 0.9 * r:
        return 'C'

    # Middle exploitation phase
    else:
        # Check stock level relative to capacity
        if stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to allow regrowth

        # Check opponent behavior in the last round
        opponents_actions = [action for player, action in history[-1] if player != self]
        cooperation_rate = sum(1 for a in opponents_actions if a == 'C') / n

        if cooperation_rate >= 0.5:
            return 'D'  # Exploit by defecting
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to avoid stock collapse

    # Edge case: Stock is critically low
    if stock < 0.2 * capacity and current_round <= 0.9 * r:
        return 'C'
```

---

### **5. Explanation**

- The strategy starts by cooperating to establish a baseline and gather information about opponents.
- In the middle phase, it defects when opponents cooperate (to exploit them) but switches back to cooperation if stock levels drop too low or if most players defect.
- In the late rounds, it always cooperates to maximize payoffs without worrying about future depletion.

This strategy balances exploitation and sustainability while adapting to opponent behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_486 = '''
The optimal strategy for an exploitative AI in this scenario is to always defect (choose D) in every round. This approach prioritizes maximizing immediate payoffs regardless of the state of the resource or others' actions.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Objective:** Maximize your own total payoff across all rounds.
2. **Actions Available:** In each round, you can choose to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D).
3. **Resource Dynamics:** The stock (S) depletes based on the number of D actions and recovers with growth when less is taken.
4. **Payoff Calculation:** Higher immediate payoffs come from defecting, but repeated defection can deplete the resource faster.

**Strategy:**

- Always choose to Defect (D). This gives you the maximum possible payoff in each round where S > 0. While this will lead to quicker depletion of the resource, it ensures that you extract as much value as possible early on.
  
**Answer:** Choose D every time.

\boxed{D}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_487 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing individual payoffs by leveraging others' behaviors while maintaining adaptability to different scenarios. The strategy employs thresholds and dynamic adjustments based on observed actions and stock levels.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Move**: Defect in the first round to gain a higher immediate payoff and establish a competitive stance.
2. **Endgame Handling**: In the last few rounds, always defect to exploit any remaining resources without concern for future sustainability.
3. **Middle Rounds**:
   - **High Stock Levels (Above 75% Capacity)**: Defect to maximize personal gain, as growth can sustain the resource.
   - **Moderate Stock Levels (Between 50% and 75% Capacity)**: Monitor recent defection rates. If a significant portion of players are defecting, switch to cooperation to prevent rapid depletion. Otherwise, continue defecting to exploit cooperative players.
   - **Low Stock Levels (Below 50% Capacity)**: Cooperate to allow the stock to recover slightly for potential future exploitation.

### Detailed Decision Rules

1. **First Round**: Always defect to secure a higher immediate payoff and signal strength.
2. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds)**: Defect in all cases, as there's no benefit in preserving resources for non-existent future rounds.
3. **Middle Rounds**:
   - If the current stock exceeds 75% of capacity: Defect to exploit high resource levels.
   - If the stock is between 50% and 75% of capacity:
     - Check recent defection rates from past rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
     - If more than 60% of other players have been defecting, switch to cooperate to prevent rapid depletion.
     - Otherwise, continue defecting to exploit others' cooperation.
   - If the stock is below 50%: Cooperate to allow some recovery, ensuring resources remain for potential future exploitation.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, n, history):
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    endgame_rounds = 3
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'D'
    elif current_round > (total_rounds - endgame_rounds):
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > high_threshold:
            return 'D'
        elif current_stock < low_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            recent_defectors = count_defectors_in_history(history, current_round - 5, current_round - 1)
            defection_rate = recent_defectors / n
            if defection_rate > 0.6:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

def count_defectors_in_history(history, start_round, end_round):
    defector_count = 0
    for round_data in history[start_round:end_round]:
        for action in round_data['actions']:
            if action == 'D':
                defector_count +=1
    return defector_count
```

### Edge Cases and Adaptations

- **First Few Rounds**: Use threshold-based decisions until sufficient historical data is available.
- **Dynamic Adjustments**: Continuously update thresholds based on observed defection trends to adapt to changing player behaviors.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with strategic cooperation when necessary, ensuring long-term payoff maximization while adapting to various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_488 = '''
To maximize your payoff in a repeated resource management scenario, follow this structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to maintain a higher stock level, which allows for more significant exploitation later.

2. **Endgame Exploitation:** In the final 5 rounds (or as the game nears its end), always Defect to maximize your immediate payoff without concern for future consequences since there are no subsequent rounds left.

3. **Stock Preservation:** If the current stock level is below 30% of capacity, Cooperate to help preserve and recover the resource. This prevents the stock from collapsing entirely, ensuring that it can sustain future exploitation.

4. **Exploitation Based on Previous Behavior:** If in the previous round more than half of the players Cooperated (i.e., strictly greater than half), Defect this round. Exploit their willingness to maintain a higher stock level by taking more for yourself while they replenish the resource.

5. **Cooperation When Necessary:** If none of the above conditions are met, Cooperate to help preserve the resource and encourage others to continue Cooperating in subsequent rounds.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Sets a baseline for cooperation, encouraging others to maintain the stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-5):**
   - **Check if in the last 5 rounds:**
     - If yes:
       - **Action:** Defect.
       - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
     - If no, proceed.

3. **Evaluate Current Stock Level:**
   - **If current stock < 30% of capacity:**
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Rationale:** Preserve the resource to prevent collapse and allow recovery.
   - **Else, check previous round's cooperation count:**

4. **Check Previous Round Cooperation:**
   - **If more than half of players Cooperated in the last round:**
     - **Action:** Defect.
     - **Rationale:** Exploit their cooperation by taking more while they replenish the stock.
   - **Else:**
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Rationale:** Encourage others to Cooperate and help maintain a sustainable resource level.

### Summary:
- Start with Cooperation to build a foundation for future exploitation.
- Preserve the resource when it's low to ensure sustainability.
- Exploit when others Cooperate sufficiently, ensuring you maximize your gains while they maintain the stock.
- In the final rounds, prioritize immediate payoff by defecting.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and previous behavior of other players.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_489 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' strategies while adapting dynamically.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reasoning: Establish a cooperative baseline without prior information. This also prevents rapid depletion, allowing time to observe opponents.

2. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Reasoning: No future rounds to consider, so maximizing current payoff is optimal.

3. **Subsequent Rounds (2 ≤ t < r):**
   - **Step 1:** Observe the number of Cooperators and Defectors from the previous round.
   - **Step 2:** Calculate the stock level after the previous round's consumption.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If more than half of the players Cooperated last round:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - Exploit their cooperation for a higher payoff while risking stock depletion.
     - Else (if more or equal players Defected):
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - Preserve the stock to allow future exploitation and avoid contributing to rapid depletion.

### Adaptation Mechanism:

- **Stock Threshold Check:**
  - If the current stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), switch to Cooperating even if most Defected, to prevent further depletion.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:**
  - Track opponents' behavior. If cooperation rate decreases over time, gradually increase defecting frequency.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Low Stock Levels (< 30% of Capacity):**
  - Prioritize Cooperating to enable stock recovery through growth, ensuring sustainable exploitation in future rounds.
- **High Stock Levels (≥ 70% of Capacity):**
  - Feel free to Defect more aggressively, as the resource can recover adequately.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```pseudocode
for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = C
    elif t == r:
        action = D
    else:
        prev_coop = number of players who Cooperated in t-1
        prev_defect = n - prev_coop
        current_stock = stock after t-1 round
        
        if current_stock < 0.3 * capacity:
            action = C
        else:
            if prev_coop > (n / 2):
                action = D
            else:
                action = C
                
    record action and opponents' actions for future rounds
```

### Summary:

This strategy starts cooperatively to observe opponents, defects when others are cooperative to exploit their behavior, and switches back to Cooperate when necessary to sustain the resource. It dynamically adapts based on stock levels and opponents' actions, ensuring long-term exploitation opportunities while mitigating risks of over-depletion.

To maximize your payoff in each round, consider employing an adaptive strategy that balances exploiting the resource with maintaining it for future gains. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Start by Cooperating to observe others' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. Calculate the proportion of Defectors (`D_prop`) from recent rounds (e.g., last k rounds).
   b. If `D_prop` exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%), prioritize Cooperating to prevent stock collapse.
   c. Otherwise, if the current stock (`S_t`) is above a high threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), Defect for higher payoff.
   d. If `S_t` is below a low threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), Cooperate to aid recovery.

**Answer:**

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when others defect excessively or the stock is low, otherwise Defect if the stock is sufficiently high.}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_491 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Begin with cooperation to encourage others and gather information about their strategies.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Opponent Behavior:**
     - Track the number of Cooperate (C) and Defect (D) actions from each opponent in previous rounds.
   - **Assess Stock Dynamics:**
     - Observe the current stock level and its trend over time. If the stock is high, defecting can be beneficial without immediate harm; if low, cooperation helps sustain it.

3. **Decision Logic for Each Round:**
   - **If Opponents Cooperate Frequently:**
     - Defect (D) to exploit their cooperation, gaining higher payoff while contributing less consumption.
   - **If Opponents Defect Frequently:**
     - Cooperate (C) to sustain the stock for future gains, preventing rapid depletion.

4. **Adjustments Based on Stock Level:**
   - **High Stock (Close to Capacity):** More tolerant of defecting as immediate impact is minimal.
   - **Low Stock:** Prioritize cooperation to ensure sustainable growth and prevent collapse.

5. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds, as there are none.

6. **Adaptation Mechanism:**
   - Continuously adjust strategy based on opponents' behavior and stock trends.
   - If exploitation leads to significant stock depletion, increase cooperation to sustain resources.

**Implementation Summary:**

- Start cooperative in the first round to set a positive tone and gather initial data.
- In subsequent rounds, adapt based on opponents' actions and the current state of the stock. Exploit when beneficial but maintain sustainability for longer-term gains.
- Conclude with defecting in the last round to maximize immediate payoff.

This strategy balances exploitation with strategic cooperation to ensure long-term resource sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_492 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to create a dynamic approach that adapts based on the game's state and history. The goal is to maximize immediate payoffs while considering future rounds, leveraging both cooperation and defection strategically.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round:** Start with Cooperate (C) to build initial stock.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If more than half of the players cooperated in the last round, defect (D) to exploit their cooperation.
   - Otherwise, cooperate (C) to preserve the resource and encourage sustainability.
3. **Last Round:** Always defect (D) as there are no future rounds.

### Rationale:
- **First Round C:** Initializes stock sustainably, allowing more rounds with higher payoffs.
- **Exploiting Cooperation:** When others cooperate, defecting yields higher immediate gains without depleting the resource excessively.
- **Preserving Resource:** By cooperating when many defect, we help conserve the stock for future exploitation opportunities.
- **Last Round D:** Maximizes payoff in the final round without worrying about future rounds.

### Pseudocode:
```python
def strategy(history, state):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to build stock
    else:
        last_round_actions = history[-1]
        num_cooperate_last_round = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions.values() if action == 'C')
        
        # If more than half of players cooperated, exploit by defecting
        if num_cooperate_last_round > n / 2:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    # Handle the last round separately
    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'
```

### Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Start with C to avoid rapid depletion.
- **Last Round:** Always defect (D) to maximize payoff without concern for future rounds.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If stock is low, consider defecting to capture remaining resources before they disappear.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on others' actions, ensuring a robust approach against various opponent behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize personal payoff by exploiting opponents' cooperation while adapting to their strategies to prevent resource collapse.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Always **Defect (D)** to test opponents' reactions and gain higher immediate payoff.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-10% of total rounds):**
   - **Check Current Stock (S):** Determine if S is above or below the Defection Threshold (T = 50% of capacity).
     - If **S > T:**
       - Calculate opponents' recent defection rate over the last 10 rounds.
         - If opponents' defection rate < 50%, **Defect (D)** to exploit their cooperation.
         - Else, **Cooperate (C)** to preserve the resource and avoid collapse.
     - If **S ≤ T:**
       - **Cooperate (C)** to help recover or sustain the stock level.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - Always **Defect (D)** to maximize immediate payoff, as future rounds are limited and resource preservation is less critical.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Start with Defect to test opponents' strategies.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow potential growth.
- **High Opponent Defection Rate:** Switch to cooperation to mitigate rapid resource depletion.

---

### **Rationale:**

- By defecting in the first round, the strategy tests whether others are inclined to cooperate or defect, providing insights for subsequent rounds.
- Monitoring opponents' behavior allows adaptive responses; exploiting when they cooperate and retreating to cooperation when too many defect to prevent collapse.
- Focusing on defecting in the final rounds ensures maximum payoff as future impacts become negligible.

This strategy balances exploitation with adaptability, ensuring high payoffs while managing resource sustainability based on opponent actions.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_494 = '''
To address the problem of devising a strategy for an AI player in a repeated game scenario where players can either cooperate or defect, affecting the common resource's stock, we propose the following structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy balances exploiting others' cooperation by defecting when they do and protecting against too much defection by cooperating unless the stock is too low. It handles first and last rounds optimally by always defecting.

### Parameters
1. **DEFECT_THRESHOLD**: Proportion of defectors in past rounds above which the AI defects (e.g., 0.5).
2. **STOCK_LOW_THRESHOLD**: Stock level below which the AI defects regardless of others' behavior (e.g., twice the number of players, 2n).

### Decision Rules
1. **First and Last Rounds**: Always defect to maximize immediate gain.
2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - If the proportion of defectors in previous rounds exceeds DEFECT_THRESHOLD, defect.
   - If the current stock is below STOCK_LOW_THRESHOLD, defect regardless of others' actions.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to allow some resource recovery for future exploitation.

### Example Scenarios
1. **All Players Defect**: Rapidly depletes the stock, leading to lower payoffs but optimal for maximization in early rounds.
2. **Mixed Strategies**: Adjusts based on historical behavior; defects when others defect heavily and cooperates otherwise.

### Conclusion
This strategy effectively balances exploitation and conservation, ensuring high immediate gains while managing resource depletion risks.

**Final Answer**
The AI follows a strategic approach where it defects in the first and last rounds, defects if previous defection rates are high or stock is low, and cooperates otherwise. This maximizes payoffs while considering future sustainability:

$\boxed{\text{Defect in first and last rounds; defect based on past defection rates or low stock; else cooperate}}$

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
Maximize personal payoff by exploiting opponents' cooperative behavior while maintaining sustainable resource levels for continued exploitation.

**Parameters:**
- `n`: Number of players
- `r`: Number of rounds
- `capacity`: Maximum stock level
- `threshold_coop` = 0.6 (60% cooperation rate to trigger defection)
- `low_stock_threshold` = 0.3 * capacity (30% of capacity triggers cooperative action)
- `high_stock_threshold` = 0.8 * capacity (80% of capacity allows for aggressive exploitation)

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**  
   - Cooperate to observe opponents' behavior and encourage initial cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r):**
   a. Calculate opponents' average cooperation rate (`avg_coop`) over the past `k` rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds) excluding your own actions.
   
   b. Check the current stock level (`current_stock`).

   c. **If**:
      - `avg_coop > threshold_coop`:  
        Opponents are cooperating enough to exploit safely.
        
        i. If `current_stock >= high_stock_threshold`:  
           Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as the resource is abundant.
           
        ii. Else:  
            Cooperate to prevent stock depletion and allow regrowth for future exploitation.

      - **Else (avg_coop <= threshold_coop)**:
         Opponents are defecting too much; cooperate to encourage others and rebuild the pool.

3. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of rounds):**
   - Defect in these rounds to maximize immediate payoff, as there's no future impact beyond the game end.

4. **Stock-Based Adjustments:**
   a. If `current_stock <= low_stock_threshold`:  
      Cooperate to allow regrowth and prevent resource collapse.
      
   b. Else if `current_stock >= high_stock_threshold`:  
      Defect aggressively, as the resource can sustain higher consumption.

5. **Adaptation Over Time:**
   - Adjust `threshold_coop` based on observed opponent behavior trends. If opponents increase cooperation over time, slightly lower your threshold to exploit more.
   
   - Monitor stock growth dynamics; if the stock regenerates faster than expected, consider a higher exploitation rate.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, past_actions):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate opponents' average cooperation rate in the last k rounds (e.g., k=5)
    k = min(5, round_number - 1)
    opponent_actions = [actions for actions in past_actions[-k:] if actions['player'] != self]
    avg_coop = sum(1 for a in opponent_actions if a['action'] == 'C') / len(opponent_actions) if opponent_actions else 0.5
    
    # Determine thresholds
    low_stock = 0.3 * capacity
    high_stock = 0.8 * capacity
    
    # Last few rounds: Defect
    if round_number >= r - (r // 10):
        return 'D'
    
    # Decision logic
    if avg_coop > threshold_coop:
        if current_stock >= high_stock:
            return 'D'  # Exploit when stock is high and safe to do so
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to allow regrowth
    else:
        return 'C'  # Encourage cooperation
    
# Example usage
round_number = ...  # Current round number
current_stock = ...  # Current stock level
past_actions = [...]  # List of past actions from all players

action = decide_action(round_number, current_stock, past_actions)
```

**Explanation:**
This strategy starts by cooperating to observe opponents' behavior. It then uses a threshold-based approach to exploit when safe and cooperate when necessary, adapting to maintain sustainable resource levels for continued exploitation. The strategy adjusts its actions based on the stock level and the cooperation rate of others, ensuring maximum personal payoff while considering long-term sustainability for future rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_496 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over r rounds by exploiting opponents while maintaining sustainable resource use when necessary.

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Observe opponents' behavior to determine their strategies and establish a baseline for cooperation rates.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Calculate the proportion of opponents who cooperated in the last few rounds.
   - **If** the majority (e.g., >60%) of opponents are cooperating:
     - **Action:** Defect.
     - **Rationale:** Exploit the cooperative behavior by gaining a higher immediate payoff while relying on others to maintain the stock.
   - **Else:**
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Rationale:** Prevent further depletion and allow stock growth for future rounds.

3. **Endgame (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future impacts since the game is nearing conclusion.

4. **Low Stock Condition:**
   - If current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity):
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Rationale:** Promote stock growth to ensure sustainability for any remaining rounds.

### **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Observation Phase:**
   - In the first few rounds, adopt cooperation to gather data on opponents' strategies and average cooperation rates.

2. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Continuously monitor opponents' actions and stock levels.
   - Adjust between cooperation and defection based on observed cooperation rates and stock status.

3. **Endgame Exploitation:**
   - Shift strategy towards defecting in the final rounds to capitalize on any remaining resources without regard for future consequences.

### **Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, opponents_actions, current_stock, capacity):
    n = len(opponents_actions) + 1  # Total players including self
    
    # Early rounds: Cooperate to observe
    if round_number <= 0.2 * total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among opponents
    recent_opponent_coop = sum(opp == 'C' for opp in opponents_actions[-5:]) / len(opponents_actions[-5:])
    
    # If stock is critically low, cooperate to allow growth
    if current_stock <= 0.3 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    
    # Last rounds: Exploit by defecting
    if round_number > 0.8 * total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    # Middle rounds: Decide based on opponent cooperation
    if recent_opponent_coop > 0.6:
        return 'D'  # Exploit when opponents are cooperative
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to maintain resource sustainability
```

### **Summary:**

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainable practices, adapting dynamically based on opponents' behavior and current game state. By exploiting in the early and middle rounds when others cooperate, it maximizes immediate gains while preserving resources for future exploitation. The endgame phase ensures maximum payoff extraction as the game concludes, making it robust against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_497 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we developed a strategy that balances exploiting cooperation when possible while preventing over-depletion of resources. Here's a structured summary of the approach:

### Approach
1. **Initial Move:** Start with defecting (D) in the first round to test opponents' behavior and maximize immediate payoff.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **High Stock Levels (>75% Capacity):** If more players cooperated in the previous round, defect to exploit their cooperation. If more defected, switch to cooperate to prevent over-depletion.
   - **Low Stock Levels (<25% Capacity):** Always cooperate to allow resource regrowth.
   - **Medium Stock Levels (25%-75% Capacity):** Base decision on whether the stock increased or decreased in the previous round. If it increased, defect; if it decreased, cooperate.
3. **Final Rounds:** Defect in the last two rounds to maximize immediate payoff without worrying about long-term consequences.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(opponent_actions_prev_round, current_stock, capacity):
    threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity

    if current_stock >= threshold_high:
        C_prev = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions_prev_round if action == 'C')
        D_prev = len(opponent_actions_prev_round) - C_prev
        return 'D' if C_prev > D_prev else 'C'
    elif current_stock <= threshold_low:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Check stock change from previous round (assuming current_stock is after last round)
        # This part requires tracking stock over rounds, which isn't directly given in the function parameters
        # For simplicity, this example focuses on opponent actions and current stock without prior stock info
        return 'D' if sum(1 for action in opponent_actions_prev_round if action == 'C') > len(opponent_actions_prev_round)/2 else 'C'

# Example usage:
capacity = 100
current_stock = 80  # Example value
opponent_actions_prev_round = ['C', 'C', 'D']  # Example actions from previous round

action = determine_action(opponent_actions_prev_round, current_stock, capacity)
print(f"Chosen action: {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Defection:** Starts with defecting to test opponents' strategies and maximize immediate payoff.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Adjusts actions based on opponents' previous moves and the current stock level. Exploits cooperation when beneficial and prevents over-depletion by cooperating when necessary.
- **Threshold-Based Decisions:** Uses thresholds (75% and 25%) of capacity to decide between defecting or cooperating, ensuring sustainable resource management while maximizing payoffs.

This approach ensures a balance between high immediate payoffs and long-term sustainability, making it effective against various opponent strategies in repeated games.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_498 = '''
To determine whether to Cooperate or Defect based on the current stock level \( S \) relative to capacity, we analyze the impact of each action on the sustainability of the resource. 

1. **Impact Analysis**:
   - If I Cooperate while others Cooperate, the total consumption is lower, helping maintain the stock.
   - If I Defect while others Cooperate, total consumption increases, potentially leading to a crash if done repeatedly.

2. **Threshold Calculation**:
   - Using game theory and equilibrium analysis, we find that the stock level stabilizes around 44.4% of capacity when defecting while others cooperate.
   - To prevent crashes and ensure sustainability, a heuristic threshold of 50% is chosen as a buffer above this equilibrium point.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Cooperate if the current stock \( S \) is above 50% of capacity to help maintain it.
   - Defect otherwise, as others are likely defecting or you can take advantage of their cooperation without causing an unsustainable crash.

### Final Answer

\boxed{Cooperate when the stock is above 50% and defect otherwise}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_499 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative yet sustainable strategy in a repeated game with known rounds, we've developed a structured approach that adapts to both current conditions and historical opponent behaviors. Here's the organized solution:

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate to encourage others to also cooperate, fostering higher growth for future exploitation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Middle Game):**
   a. Calculate the proportion of Defectors in the last 3 rounds.
   b. Determine a dynamic threshold:
      - Start with a base threshold of 75% of capacity.
      - Adjust downward based on historical Defectors (e.g., if more than 50% have defected recently, lower threshold to 60%).
   c. If current stock \( S \) is above the adjusted threshold and the proportion of Defectors in the last 3 rounds is below a target level (e.g., 60%), defect.
   d. Otherwise, Cooperate.

3. **Endgame (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff with no future consequences.

### Edge Cases

- **Low Stock Levels (e.g., below 25% capacity):** Switch to Cooperate to allow recovery and sustain future exploitation opportunities.
- **Immediate Exploitation Opportunities:** If others are Cooperating while the stock is high, exploit by defecting to gain more without collapsing the resource.

### Rationale

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. By dynamically adjusting thresholds based on historical Defectors, it prevents excessive depletion while exploiting when safe. The endgame shift ensures maximum payoff in final rounds, crucial for finite horizon games.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
current_round = 0
total_rounds = r  # total number of rounds known
history_defectors = []  # keeps track of proportion defectors each round

def decision_rule(current_stock):
    global current_round, history_defectors
    
    if current_round == 0:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Calculate proportion of Defectors in last 3 rounds
    recent_defectors = sum(history_defectors[-3:]) / 3 if len(history_defectors) >= 3 else 0
    
    # Adjust threshold based on historical Defectors
    base_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    adjustment_factor = min(recent_defectors, 0.5)
    dynamic_threshold = base_threshold - (adjustment_factor * 0.15 * capacity)
    
    if current_round > total_rounds - int(total_rounds * 0.1):
        # Last 10% rounds: always Defect
        return "Defect"
    
    if current_stock > dynamic_threshold and recent_defectors < 0.6:
        action = "Defect"
    else:
        action = "Cooperate"
    
    history_defectors.append(1 if action == "Defect" else 0)
    current_round += 1
    return action
```

### Conclusion

This strategy effectively adapts to opponent behavior, ensuring maximum exploitation while preserving resources for sustainable gains. By dynamically adjusting thresholds and focusing on endgame exploitation, it optimizes payoff throughout the game's lifecycle.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_500 = '''
To decide whether to Cooperate or Defect based on the current state of the game, you can follow these decision rules:

1. **Early Rounds (First 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Defect** with a high probability (e.g., 80%) to exploit the higher initial stock levels.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - If the current stock \( S \) is above 60% of capacity:
     - Check opponents' cooperation rates.
     - If more than half of the opponents are Cooperating, **Defect** to maximize immediate gains.
     - Otherwise, consider **Cooperating** if many opponents are Defecting to prevent rapid depletion.
   - If \( S \) is 60% or below:
     - **Cooperate** to support stock recovery and sustain future exploitation.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - If the stock is very low (<20%), **Cooperate** to attempt recovery.
   - Otherwise, **Defect** to maximize immediate gains, even if it risks crashing the stock in the next round since there's no future beyond this.

4. **Opponent Behavior Adjustment:**
   - Track each opponent's cooperation rate. If a player has Cooperated more than 70% of the time, target them by **Defecting** when they are likely to Cooperate again.
   - If most opponents have been Cooperating in recent rounds, increase your tendency to Defect; if many are Defecting, consider Cooperating more to preserve the stock.

By combining these rules, you balance immediate gains with considerations for future sustainability and exploit opponent behavior patterns effectively. 

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock is below 60% or in late rounds when stock is low; otherwise, Defect based on opponent cooperation rates.}}

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Action:**
   - **First Round:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff by taking advantage of potential Cooperators.

2. **Monitoring and Adjustment:**
   - After each round, count the number of Cooperators (C) and Defectors (D).
   - If more players Cooperate in a round:
     - Continue to Defect (D) in subsequent rounds to exploit their Cooperation.
   - If more players Defect in a round:
     - Temporarily Cooperate (C) if the stock level is below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity) to aid recovery.

3. **Stock Thresholds:**
   - Set two dynamic thresholds based on game parameters:
     - **High Threshold:** When stock > High Threshold, Defect (D) to maximize immediate gain.
     - **Low Threshold:** If stock < Low Threshold, Cooperate (C) to prevent collapse and allow recovery.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., 10% of total rounds), prioritize Defecting (D) to exploit any remaining resources without concern for future rounds.

5. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Adjust thresholds based on observed player behavior and stock dynamics.
   - If opponents frequently Cooperate, continue exploiting by defecting; if they start defecting more, consider switching to Cooperation temporarily.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, previous_actions, round_number):
    n = number_of_players  # Known parameter
    capacity = initial_capacity  # Known parameter
    r = total_rounds  # Known parameter

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'  # Start by defecting

    c_last_round = sum(1 for a in previous_actions[-1] if a == 'C')
    d_last_round = len(previous_actions[-1]) - c_last_round

    stock_growth_rate = calculate_growth(stock_level, capacity)

    if round_number >= r * 0.9:  # Last 10% of rounds
        return 'D'  # Exploit without concern for future

    high_threshold = capacity * 0.75
    low_threshold = capacity * 0.25

    if stock_level > high_threshold:
        return 'D'
    elif c_last_round > d_last_round and stock_growth_rate < 0:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent collapse
    else:
        return 'D'

def calculate_growth(current_stock, capacity):
    remaining = current_stock - total_consumption
    growth = 2 * remaining * (1 - remaining / capacity)
    return growth
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy begins by defecting to exploit initial Cooperators.
- It dynamically adjusts based on stock levels and opponents' actions, switching to Cooperation only when necessary to prevent resource collapse.
- Near the end of the game, it prioritizes exploitation to maximize final payoffs.

This approach balances immediate gains with strategic sustainability, allowing for effective exploitation while managing risks associated with resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_502 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the game described, we balance maximizing immediate payoffs with ensuring the game's sustainability by monitoring other players' actions and adjusting our strategy accordingly. Here's a structured approach:

### Exploitative Strategy Design

1. **Initial Move (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Gain higher immediate payoff and observe others' strategies.

2. **Subsequent Rounds: Adapt Based on Historical Data**

   a. **Monitor Previous Round's Actions:**
      - Track the number of players who Cooperated in the previous round.

   b. **Decision Rule:**
      - If more than 50% of players Cooperated in the previous round:
        - **Action:** Defect.
        - **Rationale:** Exploit others' cooperation by defecting, as the stock is likely still high enough to yield significant payoff.
      - Else (if 50% or fewer Cooperated):
        - **Action:** Cooperate.
        - **Rationale:** Mitigate potential stock depletion caused by heavy defection in previous rounds. This allows the stock to recover, preventing drastic drops that could reduce future payoffs.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Continuously adapt the strategy based on observed trends in others' behavior and changes in stock levels.
   - Consider increasing defection rates in later rounds if necessary, focusing on maximizing immediate gains with fewer future rounds left for recovery.

### Summary of Strategy

- **Exploitation:** Primarily defect to gain higher payoffs when others cooperate.
- **Sustainability:** Cooperate when observing heavy defection to prevent excessive stock depletion, ensuring long-term exploitability.

This strategy aims to maximize total payoff while managing the game's resources to sustain exploitation opportunities.
'''

The AI's strategy involves several key components to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability:

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Cooperate in the first few rounds to assess others' behavior and allow the stock to remain stable or recover.
2. **Dynamic Thresholding:**
   - Calculate a moving average of the stock level over recent rounds (e.g., last 10%).
   - If this average is above a high threshold (e.g., 70%), defect because the system can handle it.
   - If below a low threshold (e.g., 30%), switch to Cooperate to preserve the stock.
   - In between, base your decision on others' cooperation rate: if many are Cooperating, defect; else, Cooperate.
3. **Late Game Exploitation:** In the last few rounds (last 5%), defect as much as possible since future payoffs are minimal.

This strategy combines these elements to maximize cumulative payoff without crashing the system.

\boxed{C}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_504 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Exploitation**: Begin by defecting (D) in the first round to maximize immediate payoff when the stock is at its highest capacity.

2. **Monitor Stock Dynamics**: After each round, evaluate the new stock level. Calculate whether the stock remains above a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) and if it continues to grow sustainably.

3. **Opponent Behavior Analysis**: Track the number of defectors in previous rounds. If more than half of the players are defecting, note that the stock may be at risk of rapid depletion.

4. **Adaptive Switching**:
   - Continue defecting if the stock is above the threshold and fewer than half of players are defecting.
   - Switch to cooperating (C) if the stock drops below the threshold or if a majority of players are defecting, to allow the stock to recover.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Always defect to gain maximum immediate payoff.
   - **Last Round**: Defect again to maximize final payoff without concern for future rounds.
   - **Low Stock Levels**: Cooperate if necessary to facilitate growth, especially if others are also cooperating.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting based on the stock's health and opponents' behaviors. It is designed to be robust against various opponent strategies while maximizing individual payoffs.

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history):

To determine the optimal strategy for an individual AI in managing a shared resource, we analyze the trade-offs between defecting (taking more than one's share) and cooperating (maintaining sustainable use). The key is balancing immediate gains against long-term sustainability.

1. **Cooperate Always**: This ensures that the resource remains healthy over time, providing consistent payoffs without risking collapse. It promotes long-term stability and fairness.

2. **Defect When Possible**: While defecting can yield higher short-term gains, it risks depleting the resource if too many individuals do so, leading to a tragedy of the commons where the resource is exhausted.

3. **Conditional Cooperation/Defection**: Based on the current stock level, cooperate when the stock is above a certain threshold to prevent over-depletion and defect below that threshold to take advantage of surplus. This requires careful calculation to ensure sustainability.

Given the analysis, the optimal strategy for an individual AI, considering long-term benefits and avoiding collapse, is:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate always}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_506 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting others' cooperative behaviors while managing the resource sustainably enough to maximize long-term gains. Here's the step-by-step explanation of the strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploiter

#### 1. **Initial Round Approach**
- **First Round Action:** Cooperate.
   - Rationale: Starting with cooperation allows observation of others' initial moves without immediately depleting the stock excessively.

#### 2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision Rules**
- Track the proportion of cooperators (C) and defectors (D) in previous rounds.
- Use the current stock level to decide whether to Cooperate or Defect.

**Decision Conditions:**

- **If Current Stock is High (≥70% of Capacity):**
  - If more than half of other players Cooperated last round, Defect. Exploit their cooperation by gaining a higher payoff while contributing more to stock depletion.
  - Else, Cooperate. Avoid over-depletion when others are defecting.

- **If Current Stock is Moderate (30% ≤ Stock <70%):**
  - If the majority of other players Cooperated last round, Defect. Continue exploiting their cooperation cautiously.
  - Else, Cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow stock recovery.

- **If Current Stock is Low (<30%):**
  - Cooperate to minimize consumption and help the stock recover via growth.
  - However, if others are mostly defecting, consider a cautious Defect to exploit remaining resources slightly but avoid collapse.

#### 3. **Last Round Adjustment**
- In the final round, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact from resource depletion.

#### 4. **Stock Growth Consideration**
- After each round, calculate the new stock considering consumption and growth.
- Use this updated stock level for the next round's decision-making.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by cooperating to observe others without immediate impact on the resource.
- **Exploitation in High Stock:** When the stock is high, defects if others cooperate, maximizing personal gain while depleting the resource slightly.
- **Moderate Exploitation:** As stock decreases, continues exploiting but cautiously to avoid rapid depletion.
- **Cooperation at Low Levels:** Aims to help recover the stock when it's low, preventing collapse and ensuring future rounds have a sustainable resource.
- **Last Round Defection:** Ensures maximum payoff in the final round without worrying about long-term consequences.

This strategy adaptively balances exploitation and sustainability, aiming to maximize individual payoff while managing the common pool resource effectively against various opponent behaviors.

To maximize your payoff in each round without considering future consequences or the impact on others, you should always choose to defect.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand Payoffs:** When you defect (D), your payoff is \( \frac{S}{n} \). When you cooperate (C), it's \( \frac{S}{2n} \). Since \( n \geq 2 \), defecting always yields a higher immediate payoff.

2. **Immediate Maximization:** As an exploitative strategy focused solely on maximizing your current round's payoff, defecting is optimal because it provides twice the payoff of cooperation.

3. **Ignore Future Impact:** The strategy doesn't account for future rounds or resource depletion, focusing only on maximizing each round's gain.

**Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Defect}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_508 = '''
To address the problem, we developed a strategy that balances exploiting others while maintaining a sustainable stock level. The approach involves cooperating initially to encourage others, defecting when safe and profitable, and maximizing defection in the final rounds.

**Strategy:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Cooperate in the first round to set a cooperative tone.
2. **Subsequent Exploitation:** From round 2 until near the end:
   - Defect if few are defecting (less than 30% of players) and stock is sufficiently high (above 40% capacity).
   - Otherwise, cooperate to help maintain or recover the stock.
3. **Endgame Maximization:** In the last 20% of rounds, always defect to maximize immediate gains.

This strategy ensures exploitation when sustainable, cooperation during potential collapse, and maximum gain in final rounds.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **First Round Cooperation:** Start by cooperating to encourage others.
2. **Observing Previous Behavior:** Track the number of defectors from the previous round.
3. **Defect Safely:** If few are defecting and stock is high, defect to exploit cooperation.
4. **Cooperate When Necessary:** Switch back to cooperation if too many defect or stock is low.
5. **Final Rounds Exploitation:** Defect maximally in last rounds for immediate gain.

This approach balances short-term gains with sustainable resource management, adapting based on others' actions and current conditions.

**Answer:**

\text{Cooperate initially, defect when safe and profitable, and maximize defection near the end.}

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to establish a baseline and observe others' responses.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Until Last:**
   - **High Stock (S_t > 75% capacity):**
     - If more than half of players Cooperated in the previous round, Defect to exploit their cooperation.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate to encourage future cooperation from others.
   
   - **Moderate Stock (30% < S_t ≤ 75% capacity):**
     - If less than or equal to half of players Cooperated last round, Cooperate to promote resource sustainability.
     - Else, Defect with a 50% probability to balance immediate gains and future resource health.
   
   - **Low Stock (S_t ≤ 30% capacity):**
     - Always Cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow some stock recovery.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

**Rationale:**

- The strategy begins by Cooperating to set a foundation, which may encourage others to do the same.
- In high stock scenarios, it exploits cooperation when possible, maximizing immediate payoffs while maintaining sustainability.
- Moderate stock levels prompt strategic responses aimed at either encouraging more cooperation or cautiously defecting to balance gains and future resource health.
- Low stock situations prioritize preservation to prevent further depletion and allow potential recovery.

This adaptive approach ensures exploitation of others' cooperative tendencies while managing risks associated with overexploitation, ensuring long-term adaptability in varying game conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_510 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy is designed to maximize individual payoffs while adapting to opponents' behaviors. It balances exploitation of Cooperators with strategic Cooperations to prevent excessive resource depletion.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start by Cooperating to encourage others to do the same, preserving the stock for potential future exploitation.

2. **Middle Rounds (From Round 2 to r-2):**
   - **Recent Behavior Check:** Look at the past 3 rounds.
     - Calculate the proportion of players who Defected in these rounds.
   - **Threshold Check:**
     - If more than 40% of players Defected in these rounds, **Cooperate**.
     - Otherwise, **Defect**.
   - **Rationale:** Exploit when others Cooperate but switch to Cooperate if too many defect, preventing resource depletion.

3. **Penultimate Round (Round r-1):**
   - **Stock Check:**
     - If the current stock is above 70% of capacity, **Defect**.
     - Otherwise, **Cooperate**.
   - **Rationale:** Ensure enough stock remains for a decent payoff in the final round.

4. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff with no future consequences.

---

### **Edge Cases and Adaptations:**

- **All Players Cooperate Except Me:** Continue Defecting for higher payoffs until others start defecting, then adjust by Cooperating if necessary.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Growth is minimal; Defecting leads to rapid depletion. Monitor behavior and switch to Cooperate as needed.
- **Low Stock Levels:** High growth potential allows strategic Cooperations to rebuild resources.

---

### **Summary:**

This strategy exploitatively maximizes payoffs by defecting when others Cooperate, while adapting to prevent excessive resource depletion through Cooperation when too many defect. It ensures a balance between immediate gains and sustainable exploitation in future rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_511 = '''
To effectively exploit opponents while managing resource depletion in a repeated game, employ the following strategy:

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Observations (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Observe opponents' behavior and contribute to initial stock stability.

2. **Middle Rounds (From Round 2 to Second Last Round):**
   - **Stock-Based Decision:**
     - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity:
       - Defect if at least 60% of opponents Cooperated in the previous round.
     - If the stock is 60% or below:
       - Cooperate to aid recovery and prevent further depletion.
   - **Trend-Based Adjustment:**
     - If the stock has been decreasing over the past three rounds, increase cooperation to encourage sustainability.

3. **Final Rounds (Last Two Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate gains without concern for future rounds.

4. **Opponent Behavior Adaptation:**
   - Track opponents' actions over recent rounds.
   - If a significant majority of opponents are Cooperating, exploit by defecting more frequently.
   - If most are Defecting, adjust to Cooperate to prevent rapid resource depletion.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
for each round t in 1..r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    stock_pct = (current_stock / capacity) * 100
    opponent_actions = get_opponent_actions(t-1)
    
    if t == 1:
        action = 'C'
    elif t >= r - 1:
        action = 'D'
    else:
        num_coop = sum(1 for a in opponent_actions if a == 'C')
        opp_coop_ratio = num_coop / (n-1)
        
        if stock_pct > 75 and opp_coop_ratio > 0.6:
            action = 'D'
        elif stock_pct <= 60 or is_stock_decreasing():
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'C' if opp_coop_ratio > 0.5 else 'D'
    
    record_action(action, t)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Round:** Starting with Cooperate allows assessment of opponents' strategies without risking rapid depletion.
- **High Stock (Above 75%):** Exploit by defecting when others Cooperate, maximizing gains while the resource is abundant.
- **Low Stock (60% or Below):** Switch to Cooperate to foster recovery and sustain future exploitation opportunities.
- **Trend Monitoring:** If stock consistently decreases, adjust towards more Cooperative actions to prevent collapse.
- **Final Rounds Exploitation:** Defect in the last two rounds to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for sustainability.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource management, adapting dynamically based on opponents' behavior and current game state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_512 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing personal payoff while preventing collective stock depletion, we can employ a strategic approach that balances exploitation and cooperation based on current conditions. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **First Round**: Always defect to exploit potential cooperation from others.

2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - For each round after the first until the second-to-last round:
     a. Calculate the average defection rate of opponents over the past few rounds (e.g., 3 rounds) to determine their tendency to defect.
     b. Evaluate the current stock level relative to capacity:
        i. If the stock is above 80% of capacity, continue defecting unless more than 50% of opponents have recently defected, in which case cooperate.
        ii. If the stock is below 50%, always cooperate to prevent further depletion.
        iii. For stock levels between 50% and 80%, switch to cooperation if more than 40% of opponents have recently defected; otherwise, continue defecting.

3. **Last Round**: Defect again to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.

This strategy ensures that you exploit others when it's safe but cooperate enough to prevent the stock from collapsing entirely. Here's how it can be implemented:

```python
def decide_action(opponent_history, player_history, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = len(opponent_history) + 1  # Total players including self
    capacity = 100  # Assuming a default; adjust based on actual problem parameters

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'  # First round: defect to exploit
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'  # Last round: defect for maximum payoff
    else:
        # Calculate average defection rate over past k rounds (e.g., k=3)
        k = min(3, len(opponent_history))
        recent_opponent_defects = sum([sum(round_defects) for round_defects in opponent_history[-k:]])
        total_possible = k * (n - 1)
        if total_possible == 0:
            R = 0.0
        else:
            R = recent_opponent_defects / total_possible

        # Get current stock level (assuming it's tracked; adjust accordingly)
        # For this example, let's assume a function get_current_stock() exists
        current_stock = get_current_stock()

        if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity:
            if R > 0.5:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        elif current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:  # Between 50% and 80%
            if R > 0.4:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

This approach allows you to maximize your payoff while maintaining a balance that prevents the stock from being depleted, ensuring some level of sustainability for future rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_513 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize immediate payoffs by exploiting others' cooperative tendencies while managing long-term sustainability. It adapts based on stock levels, other players' actions, and remaining rounds.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Always Defect (D) to exploit high initial stock and maximize immediate gains.
   
2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - If current stock (S) is above a threshold (e.g., half of capacity):
     - Count Cooperate (C) actions from others in previous rounds.
     - If majority are C, continue Defecting (D).
     - If many are D, switch to Cooperate (C) to prevent rapid depletion.
   - Else if S is below the threshold:
     - Choose Cooperate (C) to maintain stock for future rounds.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - If S > threshold: Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff with no future concern.
   - Else: Cooperate (C) to ensure some payoff despite low stock.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Default to D without hesitation.
- **Last Round:** Use the late round strategy, focusing on maximizing immediate gain.
- **Stock Near Capacity or Low:** Adjust strategies based on proximity to capacity and remaining rounds. Higher stock in early/middle rounds allows exploitation; low stock requires cooperation.

### Adaptation and Monitoring:

- Track other players' actions each round. If others are defecting heavily, switch to cooperate to preserve the stock for higher payoffs.
- Calculate expected stock after consumption and growth to decide whether defecting is sustainable or will lead to collapse.

### Thresholds and Adjustments:

- Use a buffer in stock thresholds to ensure enough remains for growth.
- Lower the threshold for defecting as rounds progress, balancing immediate gains against future sustainability.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t is in first few rounds:
        choose D
    else:
        count_C = sum of Cooperate actions by others in previous rounds
        stock_threshold = capacity / 2
        if S >= stock_threshold and count_C > n/2:
            choose D
        elif S < stock_threshold or (count_C <= n/2 and t < r - few_rounds):
            choose C
    # Adjust thresholds based on remaining rounds
    remaining_rounds = r - t + 1
    if remaining_rounds < threshold_low:
        lower defecting threshold
```

### Summary:

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting to others' behaviors and stock dynamics. It aims to maximize personal payoff by exploiting cooperative players while preventing rapid resource depletion that would harm future gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_514 = '''
To address the problem of devising an optimal strategy for a repeated resource management game, we developed the Dynamic Exploitative Strategy (DES). This strategy balances immediate exploitation with preservation of resources for future gains by adapting to both stock dynamics and opponents' behaviors. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

### Step 1: Initialization
- **Base Threshold**: Set an initial threshold as a percentage of capacity (e.g., 60%).
- **End Rounds Trigger**: Identify the last 20% of rounds where the strategy will always defect to maximize immediate payoffs.
- **Moving Average Stock**: Initialize with the starting stock level to track trends.
- **Defector History**: Maintain a record of the number of players defecting in each round over recent history.

### Step 2: Decision Making Each Round
1. **End Rounds Check**: If nearing the end rounds, always defect to maximize payoffs without worrying about future depletion.
2. **Current Threshold Adjustment**:
   - Compute a dynamic threshold based on the moving average stock relative to capacity.
   - Adjust this threshold further if historical data shows high levels of defection, encouraging more cooperation.
3. **Play Decision**: Compare the current stock level with the adjusted threshold. Defect if above; cooperate otherwise.

### Step 3: Update Mechanisms
- After each round, update records of defectors and adjust the moving average stock to reflect recent trends.
- Modify the base threshold slightly based on whether the average stock is increasing or decreasing.

### Step 4: Edge Cases Handling
- **First Round**: Start with defection to test opponents' responses.
- **Critical Stock Levels**: If stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), temporarily switch to cooperation to allow recovery.
- **Near End Rounds**: Focus on immediate gains by defecting, disregarding long-term preservation.

### Final Strategy

**Dynamic Exploitative Strategy (DES)**
1. **Initialization**: Set thresholds and tracking mechanisms for stock and opponent behavior.
2. **Decision Making**: Use dynamic thresholds adjusted by stock trends and historical defection rates to decide between cooperation and defection each round.
3. **Adaptation**: Continuously update based on recent game dynamics to remain responsive to changing conditions.
4. **Edge Handling**: Manage critical points like the first and last rounds, ensuring optimal decisions despite limited future impact.

This strategy effectively navigates the balance between immediate exploitation and long-term resource preservation, adapting dynamically to maximize cumulative payoffs while preventing resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_515 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for each round, we consider several factors including the current stock level, historical cooperation from other players, and whether it is the final round. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Evaluate Round Number:**
   - If it is the final round (t = r), defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

2. **Assess Current Stock Level:**
   - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, cooperate to preserve what remains and avoid further depletion.

3. **Analyze Historical Cooperation:**
   - Calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in previous rounds (C_prev / n).

4. **Determine Thresholds:**
   - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity and at least 60% of other players have cooperated in the past, defect to exploit their cooperative behavior for a higher immediate payoff.

5. **Default to Cooperation:**
   - In all other cases, cooperate to avoid contributing to excessive resource depletion.

**Final Answer:**

For each round before the last one:
- If the current stock is above 75% and at least 60% of players cooperated previously, defect; otherwise, cooperate.
In the final round, always defect.

Thus, the strategy can be succinctly described as:

$\boxed{\text{Defect if in the last round or (stock >75\% and previous cooperation >60\%); else Cooperate}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_516 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we have developed a strategic approach that balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability. The solution adapts dynamically based on the cooperation rate of other players and the current stock level, ensuring optimal exploitation while maintaining resource health.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to encourage others to do the same, helping maintain higher stock levels.
2. **Adaptive Defection**: In subsequent rounds, monitor the cooperation rate of other players over recent rounds. If most are Cooperating, exploit this by defecting. Conversely, if many are Defecting, join them to avoid being exploited and prevent further resource depletion.
3. **Stock Level Consideration**: Adjust your strategy based on the current stock level relative to capacity. When the stock is high, feel more comfortable defecting as growth can sustain it. When low, prefer Cooperating to aid recovery.
4. **Final Rounds Exploitation**: In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%), switch to always Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs since there are no future consequences.

    if t >= r - last_rounds_threshold + 1:
        action = 'D'
    
    return action
```

### Explanation
The strategy begins by Cooperating in the first round to foster a cooperative environment. In subsequent rounds, it monitors other players' actions over recent rounds to determine their cooperation rate. Based on this rate and the current stock level relative to capacity, it decides whether to Cooperate or Defect.

- **High Stock Levels (above 80% of capacity)**: More comfortable with defecting as growth can sustain consumption.
- **Low Stock Levels (below 50% of capacity)**: Prefer Cooperating to aid recovery and prevent further depletion.
- **Moderate Stock Levels**: Adjust based on the cooperation rate, defecting if others are mostly Cooperating or Defecting significantly.

In the final few rounds (last 10%), the strategy switches to always Defecting to maximize immediate gains without worrying about future consequences. This approach balances exploitation opportunities with sustainability, adapting dynamically to maintain optimal resource management and maximize payoffs over time.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Begin with a Defect (D) action in the first round to test opponents' behavior and exploit any initial Cooperators.

2. **Stock Threshold Determination:**
   - Establish a dynamic threshold, initially set at 75% of capacity. Adjust this based on historical stock levels and opponent actions.
   - If the current stock is above the threshold, lean towards Defecting to maximize immediate gains.
   - Below the threshold, prioritize Cooperating to preserve the resource for future exploitation.

3. **Opponent Behavior Tracking:**
   - Maintain a record of each opponent's past actions (C or D) over recent rounds.
   - Calculate the percentage of opponents who Defected in the last round.
   - If most opponents are Cooperating, exploit by defecting when safe.
   - If many opponents are Defecting, increase cooperation to prevent resource depletion.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Periodically reassess and adjust the threshold based on recent stock trends and opponent behavior patterns.
   - If the stock is decreasing despite Cooperating, consider a more balanced approach or strategic defecting to avoid long-term loss.

5. **Handling Last Rounds:**
   - In the final 20% of rounds, prioritize short-term gains by defecting since future exploitation opportunities are limited.

   - **Purpose:** To gather information about opponents' behaviors and assess their tendencies towards cooperation or defection.

**2. Exploitation Phase:**
   - **Decision Rule for Defection:**
     - If more than X% of players are defecting in recent rounds, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains.
     - Example: If 60% or more of opponents have recently defected, defect in the next round.

**3. Adaptation Based on Stock Dynamics:**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:**
     - If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) and most players are cooperating, continue to cooperate to sustain higher payoffs.
   - **Defection Threshold:**
     - If the stock is below a critical level (e.g., 25% of capacity), defect to exploit remaining resources before depletion.

**4. Endgame Exploitation:**
   - **Last Few Rounds:**
     - Defect as much as possible in the last 3-5 rounds to maximize immediate gains, knowing that future payoffs are irrelevant once the game ends.

**5. Opponent Modeling:**
   - **Behavioral Patterns:**
     - If certain players consistently defect or cooperate, adjust your strategy accordingly. Exploit consistent defectors by defecting more, and exploit cooperators by defecting while they sustain resources.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```
Initialize:
    cooperation_rounds = 3
    recent_defect_threshold = 0.6 (60%)
    stock_high_threshold = 0.75 (75% of capacity)
    stock_low_threshold = 0.25 (25% of capacity)
    endgame_rounds = 3

For each round t from 1 to r:
    if t <= cooperation_rounds:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        defect_count = count_defects(opponents_actions, recent_history)
        if defect_count / n >= recent_defect_threshold:
            action = Defect
        else:
            if stock > stock_high_threshold and most_opponents_cooperate(recent_history):
                action = Cooperate
            elif stock < stock_low_threshold:
                action = Defect
            else:
                action = Cooperate  # default to sustain

    if t >= r - endgame_rounds + 1:
        action = Defect

    return action
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy begins by cooperating to gather information.
- It adapts based on recent opponent behavior and stock levels, exploiting when others defect or when resources are low.
- In the final rounds, it maximizes immediate gains through defection, ensuring high payoffs regardless of future outcomes.

This approach balances exploitation with adaptability, ensuring optimal payoff without relying on cooperation from others.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_519 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance between exploiting opponents' behaviors and managing the common pool resource effectively. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
1. **Initial Rounds**: Start with cooperation to observe opponents' strategies without depleting resources too early.
2. **Adaptive Behavior Based on History**:
   - Calculate the historical cooperation rate of opponents.
   - Adjust actions based on whether opponents are mostly cooperating or defecting.
3. **Stock Dynamics**: Monitor the current stock level to decide between cooperation and defection, aiming to maximize payoffs while preserving resource growth.
4. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the final rounds, increase defection to exploit remaining resources before the game concludes.

### Detailed Strategy

1. **First Round**:
   - Action: Cooperate (C)
   - Rationale: Observe opponents' initial moves without significantly affecting the stock.

2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - Calculate the historical cooperation rate from previous rounds.
   - Use a dynamic threshold to decide actions:
     - If the cooperation rate is high, defect (D) to exploit others while resources are still sufficient.
     - If the cooperation rate is low, cooperate (C) to allow resource regrowth for future exploitation.

3. **Stock Level Consideration**:
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity and target levels.
   - If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), defecting can be beneficial as it maximizes immediate payoff without severely depleting resources.
   - If below the threshold, cooperate to encourage resource replenishment.

4. **Endgame Adjustment**:
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 3-5%), increase defection to maximize payoffs before the game ends, exploiting any remaining resources without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock, history):
    # Initial setup
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate from history
    cooperation_rate = sum(1 for action in history if action == 'C') / len(history) if history else 0.5
    
    # Determine threshold based on game progression
    remaining_rounds = total_rounds - round_number + 1
    endgame_threshold = max(0.2, (total_rounds - remaining_rounds) / total_rounds)
    
    # Adaptive decision-making
    if cooperation_rate > 0.6:
        return 'D'  # Exploit by defecting when others cooperate
    elif cooperation_rate < 0.4:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to replenish resources
    else:
        # Consider stock level for decision
        target_level = capacity * 0.5
        if stock > target_level:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    # Endgame adjustment
    if remaining_rounds <= 0.03 * total_rounds:
        return 'D'  # Exploit in final rounds

# Example usage
history = []
for t in range(r):
    action = decide_action(t+1, r, stock, history)
    history.append(1 if action == 'C' else 0)
    # Proceed with the game using 'action'
```

### Summary
This strategy adapts dynamically based on opponents' past behavior and current resource levels. It starts cooperatively to gather information, adjusts actions based on observed cooperation rates, considers stock health to avoid depletion, and switches to exploitation in the endgame to maximize payoffs. This approach ensures robustness against various opponent strategies while maintaining exploitability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_520 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've designed an adaptive strategy that balances exploitation of cooperative opponents with maintaining sustainable resource levels. The approach considers current stock levels, historical opponent behavior, and proximity to the end of the game.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation.
2. **Endgame Exploitation**: In the last few rounds (specifically the last 5-10%), defect to maximize immediate payoffs without worrying about future depletions.
3. **Dynamic Decision-Making**:
   - **High Stock Levels**: If the stock is above 60% of capacity and opponents have been mostly cooperating, defect to exploit their cooperation.
   - **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock drops below 30% of capacity, cooperate to help regrow the resource.
   - **Moderate Stock Levels**: Cooperate to maintain or rebuild the resource, especially if many opponents are defecting.

This strategy ensures that we exploit opportunities when beneficial while preserving the resource for future rounds when necessary.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history, n_players, capacity, total_rounds):
    """
    Decide whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) based on current round number,
    stock level, and historical actions of opponents.

        total_rounds: Total number of rounds in the game
    
    Returns:
        Action to take: 'C' for Cooperate, 'D' for Defect
    """
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number > total_rounds - 5:  # Last 5 rounds
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate opponents' recent cooperation rate
        opponent_actions = history[-n_players:] if len(history) >= n_players else []
        opponent_coop_rate = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions if action == 'C') / len(opponent_actions) if opponent_actions else 0
        
        # Define thresholds
        high_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
        low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
        
        if stock_level > high_threshold and opponent_coop_rate > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        elif stock_level < low_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Cooperate otherwise to maintain or rebuild the resource
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The first round is always a cooperation move to set a positive tone and encourage others to cooperate.
- **Endgame Exploitation**: In the last few rounds, defecting maximizes immediate gains since there are no future rounds to suffer from resource depletion.
- **Dynamic Decisions**:
  - When stock levels are high (above 60% of capacity) and opponents have been cooperating more than defecting (over 50%), it's optimal to defect to exploit their cooperation, gaining higher immediate payoffs.
  - If the stock is low (below 30% of capacity), cooperation helps in regrowing the resource for potential future rounds.
  - In moderate conditions or when many opponents are defecting, continuing to cooperate aids in maintaining a sustainable resource level.

This strategy dynamically adapts based on current conditions and historical behavior, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_521 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round based on the current stock and previous rounds' behavior, we can employ a dynamic threshold strategy. This approach allows us to adapt our actions according to others' tendencies while ensuring maximum exploitation when possible. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set an initial threshold for cooperation at 75% of the capacity.
   - Define adjustment parameters to modify this threshold dynamically.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - For each round, if we're in the last 10% of total rounds, always defect to maximize immediate gains.
   - Otherwise, compare the current stock against our dynamic threshold:
     - If above the threshold, cooperate.
     - If below or equal, defect.

3. **Post-Round Analysis:**
   - After each round, calculate the ratio of actual consumption to the maximum possible consumption (current stock).
   - Adjust the threshold based on this ratio:
     - If more than half of the maximum consumption occurred (indicating more defectors), lower the threshold.
     - Otherwise, raise the threshold.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure the threshold doesn't go below 20% or above 90% of capacity to prevent extreme behavior.

This strategy balances adaptability with sustainability while focusing on maximizing immediate gains through strategic defection when advantageous.

**Answer:**

To maximize your share while adapting to others' strategies, employ a dynamic threshold approach:

1. **Start with an initial cooperation threshold at 75% of the stock capacity.**
2. **For each round:**
   - If in the last 10%, always defect.
   - Otherwise, cooperate if the current stock is above your threshold; else, defect.
3. **After each round:**
   - Calculate the ratio of actual consumption to maximum possible (current stock).
   - Adjust your threshold:
     - Lower it if more than half consumed (more defectors).
     - Raise it otherwise.
4. **Cap adjustments between 20% and 90% to prevent extremes.**

This strategy adapts dynamically, ensuring you exploit when advantageous while maintaining flexibility.

\boxed{
\text{Adopt a dynamic threshold strategy: Cooperate above 75% initially, adjust based on others' behavior, defect in final rounds.}
}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_522 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that is adaptive and robust, we can outline a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Exploitation**: Start by defecting in the first few rounds to exploit any initial cooperators. This maximizes immediate payoff while observing others' behavior.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: Track the current stock level after each round. Use this information to decide whether to cooperate or defect in subsequent rounds.

3. **Dynamic Threshold for Defection**:
   - If the current stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), continue defecting as it doesn't significantly impact future growth.
   - Below this threshold, switch to cooperating to allow replenishment and sustain higher payoffs over time.

4. **Adapt to Others' Behavior**: Observe others' actions. If many are defecting, consider switching to cooperate to prevent rapid depletion. Conversely, if cooperation is observed, defect to exploit.

5. **Final Rounds Adjustment**:
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., 3 rounds before the end), prioritize defecting to maximize immediate gains since future payoffs are no longer a concern.

6. **Prevent Depletion**: If the stock drops below a critical level where further defecting would lead to rapid depletion, switch to cooperating to allow some growth for remaining rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def strategy(history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = initial_capacity()
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    total_rounds = r
    stock = get_current_stock()

    # Initial defect in the first round to exploit
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'D'

    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among others
    recent_coop_rate = calculate_recent_cooperation_rate(history, window=5)

    # Determine threshold based on capacity and rounds remaining
    threshold = max(capacity * 0.75, 2n)  # Ensure it's above minimum sustainable level

    # Check if in the last few rounds
    if current_round > total_rounds - 3:
        return 'D'

    # Decision rules based on stock and cooperation rate
    if stock > threshold or recent_coop_rate < 0.3:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Exploitation**: The strategy starts by defecting to exploit any initial cooperators, maximizing immediate payoff.
- **Monitoring and Adaptation**: By tracking stock levels and others' cooperation rates, the strategy adapts dynamically. It defects when resources are abundant and others are cooperative, switching to cooperate as resources dwindle or others start defecting more.
- **Threshold Adjustment**: The threshold for defecting is set based on capacity and remaining rounds, ensuring it doesn't deplete resources too quickly while still exploiting opportunities.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, exploiting others' behavior while preventing complete resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_523 = '''
To address the problem of determining when to defect or cooperate in a repeated game with shared resources, we can use an adaptive strategy based on the current state of the shared resource (stock). The goal is to maximize immediate payoffs while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the resource.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to gauge others' behavior and contribute to maintaining the stock.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: Use a threshold (e.g., 70% of maximum capacity) to decide actions:
   - If the current stock is above the threshold, defect to gain higher immediate payoffs.
   - If below the threshold, cooperate to allow the stock to recover and sustain future gains.
3. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Continuously monitor the stock's health over rounds and adjust the strategy based on observed trends.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, previous_rounds):
    # Threshold can be adjusted based on experiments or analysis
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return "DEFECT"
    else:
        return "COOPERATE"

# Example usage over multiple rounds
capacity = 100
current_stock = 100
previous_rounds = []  # List to keep track of previous actions and stock levels

for round_number in range(1, 6):  # Simulate 5 rounds
    action = decide_action(current_stock, capacity, previous_rounds)
    print(f"Round {round_number}: Action is {action}")
    
    # For demonstration, simulate the effect of the action on current_stock
    # This is a simplified simulation; actual game dynamics may vary
    if action == "DEFECT":
        consumption = 25  # Example impact
        new_stock = max(current_stock - consumption + growth(current_stock - consumption, capacity), 0)
    else:
        new_stock = current_stock
    
    # Update current_stock for next round (simplified)
    current_stock = new_stock
    previous_rounds.append((action, current_stock))

def growth(s_remaining, capacity):
    return 2 * s_remaining * (1 - s_remaining / capacity)

# Note: The above simulation is simplified and should be replaced with actual game dynamics.
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting to cooperate, the strategy allows for a stable initial state where the stock can be maintained or even grow due to others' contributions.
- **Threshold Check**: The threshold (70% of capacity) serves as a safeguard. Defecting is only done when the resource is sufficiently abundant to withstand the higher consumption without risking collapse.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: By monitoring past rounds and the current stock level, the strategy adapts to changes in resource availability, ensuring that exploitation does not lead to long-term depletion.

This approach balances immediate gains with the need for sustainable resource management, allowing for both short-term exploitation and long-term cooperation as needed.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_524 = '''
To maximize payoffs while maintaining sustainability, employ a threshold-based strategy:

1. **Defect** when the current stock is above 80% of capacity to exploit abundance.
2. **Cooperate** when the stock drops below 40% to allow recovery and prevent depletion.
3. **Defect in the last round** to capitalize on remaining resources.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term resource management, ensuring continued benefits without complete exhaustion.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when the stock is below 40%, defect otherwise except in the last round where you always defect.}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_525 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff by exploiting others' behavior while maintaining sustainable resource levels.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Gather initial information on opponents' strategies.

2. **Last Two Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff with no concern for future rounds.

3. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Step A:** Calculate the recent defection rate.
     - Count D actions from all players in the last `m` rounds (e.g., `m = 5`).
     - Compute `recent_defection_rate = total_D / (n * m)`.
   
   - **Step B:** Evaluate current stock level against thresholds.
     - `threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity`
     - `threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity`

   - **Decision Logic:**
     1. If `current_stock < threshold_low`:
        - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
        - **Rationale:** Help recover the stock to prevent depletion.
        
     2. Else if `current_stock > threshold_high`:
        - **Action:** Defect (D)
        - **Rationale:** Exploit high stock with minimal impact on future growth.

     3. Else:
        - If `recent_defection_rate > high_threshold` (e.g., `0.6`):
          - **Action:** Defect (D)
          - **Rationale:** Exploit others' exploitation to maximize payoff.
          
        - Else if `recent_defection_rate < low_threshold` (e.g., `0.4`):
          - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
          - **Rationale:** Encourage cooperation and maintain sustainable stock levels.
          
        - Else:
          - Use a weighted score combining defection rate and stock level to decide between C and D.

---

### **Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to observe others' strategies without impacting the stock significantly.
- **Last Two Rounds:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there's no future impact.
- **Stock Extremely Low (< threshold_low):** Cooperate to prevent resource depletion and allow recovery.

---

### **Exploitative Aspect:**

The strategy adapts by defecting when others are exploiting the common pool, maximizing immediate payoffs. It defects when the stock is high, where exploitation has less impact on future growth. By monitoring recent behavior and current stock levels, it effectively exploits opponents' strategies while balancing sustainable resource management.

---

### **Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, history, n, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number >= r - 1:
        return 'D'
    else:
        m = min(5, round_number - 1)
        recent_defections = sum(action == 'D' for actions in history[-m:] for action in actions)
        recent_defection_rate = recent_defections / (n * m)
        
        threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity
        threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
        
        if current_stock < threshold_low:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock > threshold_high:
            return 'D'
        else:
            high_threshold = 0.6
            low_threshold = 0.4
            
            if recent_defection_rate > high_threshold:
                return 'D'
            elif recent_defection_rate < low_threshold:
                return 'C'
            else:
                # Use a weighted score (example weights: stock=0.4, defection=0.6)
                weight_stock = 0.4
                weight_defection = 0.6
                
                score_stock = (current_stock - threshold_low) / (threshold_high - threshold_low)
                score_defection = recent_defection_rate
                
                total_score = (score_stock * weight_stock) + (score_defection * weight_defection)
                
                return 'D' if total_score > 0.5 else 'C'
```

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to opponents' behaviors while ensuring long-term resource health.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_526 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts to various opponent behaviors while maximizing personal payoff, we outline a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy balances immediate exploitation with preservation of the resource to sustain long-term gains. It adapts dynamically based on stock levels and opponents' actions.

---

### Decision Rules:

1. **Early Rounds (First 10%):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Exploit high stock levels for maximum immediate payoff while assessing opponents' strategies.

2. **Middle Rounds (80% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Stock Thresholds:**
     - **High Stock (S > 60% Capacity):** Defect.
       - Reasoning: High stock allows defecting without risking rapid depletion; exploit when possible.
     - **Moderate Stock (30% ≤ S ≤ 60% Capacity):** 
       - Calculate opponents' cooperation rate over the past few rounds.
       - If >70% cooperate, defect; their actions help replenish the resource.
       - If >70% defect, switch to Cooperate (C) to prevent crash.
       - Else, defect if opponents' defection rate is lower than yours.
     - **Low Stock (S < 30% Capacity):** Cooperate.
       - Reasoning: Preserve remaining stock to ensure future payoffs.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 10%):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate gains as future rounds are irrelevant.

---

### Dynamic Adaptations:

- **Adjust Thresholds Over Time:** Gradually lower the cooperate threshold as the game progresses to adapt to dwindling rounds.
  - Formula: `cooperate_threshold = max(0.3 * capacity, 1 - (t / r) * 0.4)`
  
- **Monitor Opponents' Behavior:** Use a moving average of past cooperation rates to smooth out short-term fluctuations and inform strategy adjustments.

---

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Defect to gain high payoff without prior information.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Defect to exploit remaining stock regardless of levels.
- **Near Capacity Stock:** Exploit if opponents cooperate; else, defect cautiously.
- **Low Stock (below 30%):** Cooperate to prevent crash and sustain future gains.

---

### Summary:

The strategy prioritizes immediate exploitation in early rounds, dynamically adapts based on stock levels and opponents' behavior in the middle, and maximizes gains in late rounds. This approach ensures both high payoffs and resource sustainability over the game's duration.

To address the problem effectively, I will outline a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by using a threshold-based approach.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

1. **Identify the Threshold (T):**
   - Determine a threshold T as a fraction of the total capacity C. For example, set T to 0.6*C or another suitable fraction based on balancing exploitation and conservation.

2. **Decision-Making in Each Round:**
   - In each round, check the current stock level S.
   - If S > T: Choose to defect (take more than your fair share).
   - Else: Cooperate (take your fair share).

**Example with n=4 and C=100:**

- Let's set T = 60 (which is 0.6*100).
- When the stock S > 60: Defect.
- When S ≤ 60: Cooperate.

**Rationale:**
- By setting a threshold, you ensure that when resources are abundant (above T), you maximize your immediate gain by defecting. However, as resources become scarcer (below or equal to T), cooperation helps sustain the resource for future rounds, preventing rapid depletion.

**Answer:**

You will adopt a threshold strategy where you defect if the current stock is above 60% of capacity and cooperate otherwise. 

$\boxed{\text{Defect if stock > }60\%\text{ of capacity; else cooperate}}$

description_EXPLOITATIVE_528 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains against long-term resource sustainability in a multi-round game where players can choose to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), we propose a decision strategy that prioritizes exploitation while maintaining a threshold to prevent catastrophic depletion. Here's a structured breakdown:

### **Decision Strategy**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Justification: Prioritizes immediate payoff and tests the behavior of other players.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Threshold Setting:** Establish an initial threshold at 60% of the total resource capacity.
   - **Current Stock Check:** Evaluate the current stock level against the set threshold.
     - If **current_stock > threshold**, choose to Defect (D) to maximize immediate gains.
     - If **current_stock <= threshold**, switch to Cooperate (C) to allow resource recovery.

3. **Final Rounds Handling:**
   - In the last 2-3 rounds, default to Defect (D) regardless of stock level since future payoffs are minimal or nonexistent.

### **Edge Cases and Adjustments**

- **Stock Near Zero:** If the current stock is critically low, consider cooperating to attempt recovery. However, if a majority of players continue defecting, this may be futile.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Monitor trends in resource depletion and adjust the threshold slightly each round based on observed changes.

### **Implementation Steps (Pseudocode)**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, current_stock, num_players, capacity):
    threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > threshold:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            action = 'C'
        
        # Optional: Adjust threshold based on observed trends
        # (This part is more complex and omitted for simplicity)
    
    return action

# Example usage over rounds:
capacity = 100
num_players = 4
current_stock = capacity  # Starting stock

for round_number in range(1, 5):  # Simulate first 4 rounds
    action = decide_action(round_number, current_stock, num_players, capacity)
    print(f"Round {round_number}: Action chosen is {action}")
    
    # Update current_stock based on all players' actions (simplified for example)
    if round_number == 1:
        current_stock = 0  # All defect in first round
    else:
        # Placeholder logic to simulate stock change
        pass
```

### **Conclusion**

This strategy balances the desire for immediate gains with a cautious approach to prevent resource collapse. By setting a threshold and adjusting based on observed behavior, it allows for exploitation while maintaining some level of sustainability. This approach can be further refined by incorporating more dynamic adjustments based on detailed historical data and opponent behavior patterns.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_529 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing immediate payoffs while considering resource sustainability through an exploitative strategy, we've developed a structured approach that combines observations of opponents' behavior and current stock levels. Here's the organized solution:

### Approach
The strategy is designed to exploit others when they are cooperative, thereby increasing your payoff without causing excessive resource depletion. It also aims to preserve the resource when necessary by cooperating if others are defecting or if the stock is low.

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a baseline and gauge opponents' initial behavior.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Observe Current Stock (S)**: Check if the stock level is above 75% of capacity.
   - **Assess Opponents' Behavior**: Determine if more than half of the other players cooperated in the last round.
   - **Decision Making**:
     - If both conditions are met (stock >75% and >50% cooperation from others), Defect to exploit their cooperative behavior.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate to either preserve the resource or avoid contributing to rapid depletion when others are defecting.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(history, n_players, round_number, capacity, current_stock):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "COOPERATE"
    
    # Calculate the number of cooperations in the last round from other players
    last_round = history[-1]
    other_cooperations = sum(1 for action in last_round if action == 'COOPERATE') - (1 if history[-1][0] == 'COOPERATE' else 0)
    proportion_coop = other_cooperations / n_players
    
    # Check conditions
    if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity and proportion_coop > 0.5:
        return "DEFECT"
    else:
        return "COOPERATE"
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts with cooperation in the first round to observe opponents' behavior.
- **Observation of Stock Level**: By checking if the current stock is above 75% of capacity, we ensure that exploitation doesn't lead to rapid resource depletion.
- **Assessment of Opponents' Behavior**: Tracking the proportion of cooperations from other players allows us to exploit their cooperative tendencies when beneficial.
- **Balanced Exploitation and Preservation**: The strategy defects only when it's advantageous (high stock and high cooperation), otherwise, it cooperates to maintain sustainability.

This approach effectively balances immediate gains with long-term resource management, ensuring a profitable yet sustainable strategy.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_530 = '''
To address the problem, we developed an AI strategy that balances exploitation with preservation to maximize individual payoff over multiple rounds without causing resource depletion. The strategy is designed to exploit when possible and switch to cooperation when necessary to prevent crashes.

### Approach
The strategy uses a threshold-based approach:
1. **Initialization**: Cooperate in the first round.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Defect if the current stock level is above 60% of its capacity, indicating it's safe to exploit without causing depletion.
   - Cooperate otherwise to preserve the resource and avoid crashes.
3. **Last Round**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

This approach ensures that exploitation occurs only when the resource is sufficiently healthy, preventing rapid depletion while maximizing personal gain.

### Solution Code
```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_stock = None
        self.round_number = 0
        self.capacity = None

    def decide_action(self, current_stock, round_number, num_players, total_history=None):
        if self.capacity is None:
            # Assume initial stock is given as part of the setup; adjust accordingly.
            self.capacity = current_stock  # This may need adjustment based on actual initial conditions
        self.round_number = round_number

        if round_number == 1:
            action = 'C'
            self.previous_stock = current_stock
            return action
        else:
            safe_threshold = 0.6 * self.capacity
            if current_stock > safe_threshold and self.round_number < len(total_history):
                action = 'D'
            elif current_stock <= safe_threshold:
                action = 'C'
            else:  # In the last round, defect regardless of stock level
                action = 'D'

            self.previous_stock = current_stock
            return action

    def reset(self):
        self.previous_stock = None
        self.round_number = 0
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The strategy starts by Cooperating in the first round to observe the resource's behavior.
- **Threshold Check**: For each subsequent round, it checks if the current stock level is above a safe threshold (60% of capacity). If so, it defects to exploit the resource. Otherwise, it Cooperates to prevent depletion.
- **Last Round Exploitation**: In the final round, it defects to maximize immediate payoff without worrying about future rounds.

This strategy effectively balances exploitation and preservation, ensuring long-term sustainability while maximizing individual gain where possible.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_531 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitative Approach**

1. **Initial Round Action**
   - In the first round, choose to Cooperate ('C') to encourage a cooperative environment and assess other players' behaviors.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision Making**
   - For each subsequent round:
     - Calculate the cooperation rate of other players over the past few rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds) to determine the trend.
     - Determine if the current stock level is above a dynamically adjusted threshold, which considers the maximum sustainable stock and recent stock depletion trends.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**
   - The threshold for switching from Cooperate to Defect is calculated based on:
     - A percentage of the capacity (e.g., 70%).
     - Adjustments made in response to observed stock depletion caused by previous rounds' actions.

4. **Cooperation Rate Consideration**
   - If the cooperation rate among other players exceeds 50%, it suggests a potential for maintaining or increasing the stock, encouraging continued cooperation.
   - Conversely, if the cooperation rate drops below 50%, indicating more players are defecting, switch to Defect ('D') to exploit remaining resources.

5. **Last Round Handling**
   - In the final round (r), always choose to Defect ('D') as there are no future rounds to consider, maximizing immediate payoff.

6. **Critical Stock Level Check**
   - If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to Defect regardless of other players' actions to capture remaining resources before potential depletion.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def strategy(history, state):
    n = number_of_players
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate cooperation rate among other players over the last few rounds
        recent_rounds = min(5, len(history))
        other_players_actions = [action for round in history[-recent_rounds:] for action in round if action != self]
        cooperation_rate = sum(1 for a in other_players_actions if a == 'C') / len(other_players_actions) if other_players_actions else 0.5
        
        # Determine threshold based on stock dynamics
        capacity = state.capacity
        critical_threshold = capacity * 0.2  # 20% of capacity
        maintenance_threshold = max(capacity * 0.7, critical_threshold)
        
        # Decision making
        if current_round == r:
            return 'D'
        elif state.stock > maintenance_threshold and cooperation_rate > 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by Cooperating to foster a cooperative environment while gathering information.
- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjusts thresholds based on observed stock levels and other players' actions, ensuring adaptability.
- **Responsive Defection:** Switches to Defect when detecting a shift towards more defecting behavior or critical stock depletion, maximizing immediate gains and exploiting opponents who may be unaware of the resource's fragility.

This strategy balances between sustaining resources through cooperation and exploiting opportunities when others defect, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_532 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with future sustainability in a common pool resource game, I've developed a strategic approach that adapts based on the phase of the game, current stock levels, and observed cooperation rates among players. The strategy is designed to maximize payoffs while considering the long-term health of the shared resource.

### Approach
The strategy consists of three main phases:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first few rounds (typically the first 5), always Cooperate. This phase aims to establish a high stock level, encouraging growth and setting the stage for sustainable exploitation in subsequent rounds.

2. **Adaptive Defection**: As the game progresses beyond the initial rounds:
   - If the current stock is above a safe threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) and there's a strong cooperation rate among players (above 70%), continue Cooperating to maintain the resource.
   - Otherwise, start defecting more frequently. This phase adjusts based on observed behavior; if others are defecting, it becomes advantageous to do so as well.

3. **Late Game Exploitation**: In the final rounds:
   - Increase the likelihood of Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs since there's less time left for recovery.
   - If the stock is critically low or cooperation rates have dropped significantly, prioritize defecting to exploit whatever remains.

### Solution Code
```python
import random

def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, history):
    # Early rounds: Cooperate
    if round_number <= 5:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate in previous rounds
    prev_coop = sum(1 for h in history if h == 'C') / len(history) if history else 0.5
    
    # Determine safe stock thresholds based on game phase
    phase = round_number / total_rounds
    safe_stock_high = capacity * 0.8
    safe_stock_low = capacity * 0.4
    
    if phase < 0.5:
        # Middle phase: Cooperate if conditions are favorable, else Defect
        if current_stock >= safe_stock_high and prev_coop > 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        # Late phase: More likely to Defect based on stock level and cooperation rate
        if current_stock < safe_stock_low or prev_coop < 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Use a probability proportional to the stock level to decide between C and D
            prob Cooperate = (current_stock - safe_stock_low) / (safe_stock_high - safe_stock_low)
            if random.random() < max(0, min(prob_Cooperate, 1)):
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Early Cooperation**: The strategy begins with Cooperating to build up the resource. This encourages others to do the same and sets a foundation for sustainable exploitation.
  
- **Adaptive Defection**: As the game progresses, the strategy monitors both the current stock level and the cooperation rate among players. If the stock is high and cooperation is strong, it continues to Cooperate to maintain these conditions. However, if the stock drops or cooperation wanes, it starts defecting more frequently to exploit the resource while it still can.

- **Late Game Exploitation**: In the final rounds, the strategy shifts towards maximizing immediate payoffs by increasing defection rates. This phase recognizes that there's limited time for recovery and focuses on extracting as much value as possible from the remaining resource.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and player behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_533 = '''
To address the question of whether to cooperate or defect in a scenario where each action impacts future rounds, we analyze the immediate and long-term consequences. The decision hinges on maximizing current gains while considering sustainability for future benefits.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Immediate Payoff:** Defecting yields an immediate gain compared to Cooperating.
2. **Long-Term Impact:** While defecting increases current payoff, it depletes the shared resource (stock), potentially reducing future payoffs.
3. **Sustainability Consideration:** If the stock is sustainably managed through Cooperation, future rounds can maintain consistent payoffs without depletion.
4. **Exploitative Strategy:** Focusing solely on maximizing personal gain leads to defecting whenever possible, even at the expense of depleting resources.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. However, if the goal is to maximize individual gain regardless of future consequences, always defecting is chosen.

$\boxed{\text{Always Defect}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_534 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategic approach that balances initial cooperation with adaptive exploitation based on observed behaviors and resource conditions. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase**: Begin by cooperating for the first 25% of total rounds. This phase encourages others to cooperate and allows the resource stock to recover or maintain its level.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation Phase**:
   - After the initial phase, monitor the game dynamics in each subsequent round.
   - Track the proportion of players defecting in recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds). If more than 30% of players are defecting, switch to defecting to exploit the situation while it's beneficial.
   - Additionally, check the current stock level. If it drops below 70% of capacity, start defecting to maximize immediate gains.

3. **Late Game Exploitation**: In the final 10% of rounds, always defect. This ensures maximum payoff in the game's closing stages when future consequences are irrelevant.

4. **Recovery Check (Optional)**: If after defecting, the stock shows signs of recovery (e.g., increases in consecutive rounds), revert to cooperation to encourage a cooperative environment again.

This strategy adapts dynamically based on player behavior and resource state, ensuring a balance between encouraging cooperation and exploiting opportunities for maximum gain. It's designed to be robust against various scenarios while maintaining simplicity in implementation.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy involves initially cooperating, adapting based on others' actions and resource levels, and defecting maximally in the late game. This approach is encapsulated in a clear step-by-step plan that balances cooperation and exploitation effectively.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially, adapt to defection trends and low stock by defecting, exploit fully in final rounds}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_535 = '''
The AI adopts a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability:

1. **First Round**: Always defect to maximize initial payoff.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock is above 70% of capacity and has been stable or increasing, continue defecting.
   - If the stock falls below 50% or shows a significant downward trend, switch to cooperation to preserve resources.
   - In intermediate levels (50%-70%), defect if others are cooperating; otherwise, cooperate cautiously.

**Final Answer:**

The AI defects when the resource level is above 70% and cooperates if it drops below 50%, adjusting based on observed trends. The strategy balances immediate gains with preserving resources for future rounds.

$\boxed{\text{Defect if the resource level is above 70% or in the first round; cooperate otherwise to preserve resources.}}$

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff by exploiting opponents' behaviors while maintaining the common stock's sustainability.

---

### **Decision Rules:**
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Test opponents' reactions and maximize immediate gains with no prior information.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   a. **Analyze Opponents' Behavior:**
      - Track each opponent's cooperation rate (Coop% = number of Cooperate actions / total rounds observed).
   
   b. **Exploit Cooperative Players:**
      - If an opponent's Coop% > 50%, defect against them to maximize personal payoff.
   
   c. **Adapt to Defectors:**
      - If a majority are defecting, switch to cooperate more to prevent resource collapse and sustain future payoffs.
   
   d. **Stock Level Consideration:**
      - **High Stock (Above 75% capacity):** Continue defecting as the stock can recover quickly.
      - **Low Stock (Below 25% capacity):** Cooperate to allow recovery and prevent crash.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Focus on maximizing immediate payoff with few future rounds left.

---

### **Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round (No History):** Default to Defect.
- **Low Stock Early On:** Switch to Cooperate temporarily to prevent collapse.
- **High Cooperators:** Exploit by defecting until stock indicates a switch to Cooperate is needed.

---

### **Pseudocode Logic:**
```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, n, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate opponents' cooperation rates
    coop_rates = calculate_coop_rates(history)
    
    # Determine number of cooperative players
    num_cooperative = sum(1 for rate in coop_rates.values() if rate > 0.5)
    
    if num_cooperative > n / 2:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > capacity * 0.75:
            return 'D'
        elif current_stock < capacity * 0.25:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Check remaining rounds
            if round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'D' if num_cooperative > 0 else 'C'

def calculate_coop_rates(history):
    coop_rates = {}
    for opponent_id in history.keys():
       coop_count = sum(1 for action in history[opponent_id] if action == 'C')
        total = len(history[opponent_id])
        coop_rates[opponent_id] = coop_count / total
    return coop_rates
```

---

### **Summary:**
- **Early Exploitation:** Start by defecting to exploit cooperative opponents and gauge their behavior.
- **Adaptive Adjustment:** Monitor stock levels and opponent actions. Defect when the stock is resilient; cooperate if it's at risk of collapse.
- **Late-Game Maximization:** Focus on defecting in the final rounds to maximize immediate gains.

This strategy dynamically balances exploitation with sustainability, ensuring maximum payoff while avoiding premature resource depletion.

2. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round (t=1):** Defect to exploit high initial stock for maximum payoff.
   - **Subsequent Rounds (t>1):**
     a. Calculate opponents' defection rates based on historical data.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_538 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation with preservation in a dynamic environment where other players' strategies are unknown, I propose the following strategy:

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Preservation**

1. **Initial Exploitation Phase (First 20% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect when the current stock is above 80% of capacity.
   - **Rationale:** Take advantage of abundant resources to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Adaptive Mid-Phase:**
   - **Track Behavior:** Monitor the number of Defectors in each round.
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If more than 60% of players Defected in the previous round and current stock is below 70% capacity, Cooperate to prevent further depletion.
     - Otherwise, continue Defecting to exploit available resources.

3. **Late Preservation Phase (Last 20% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate regardless of other factors.
   - **Rationale:** Preserve remaining resources for the final rounds, ensuring some payoff in later stages.

**Implementation Logic:**

```python
def decide_action(S_current, D_count_prev, n_players, round_num, total_rounds):
    capacity = 100  # Example capacity; replace with actual value
    initial_phase_end = 0.2 * total_rounds
    late_phase_start = 0.8 * total_rounds

    if S_current > 0.8 * capacity and round_num <= initial_phase_end:

    elif round_num >= late_phase_start:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Exploitation:** Maximizes immediate gains when resources are abundant.
- **Adaptive Mid-Phase:** Adjusts based on others' behavior to prevent resource depletion, switching to Cooperation if Defectors dominate and stock is low.
- **Late Preservation:** Ensures some resources remain for the final rounds, balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

This strategy dynamically adapts to changing conditions and other players' actions, aiming to maximize cumulative payoff while preventing catastrophic depletion.

2. **Adaptive Moves**: For subsequent rounds, defect if the majority of players are expected to Cooperate and the current stock is sufficiently high. Otherwise, continue Cooperating.
3. **Endgame Strategy**: Near the end of the game (last 1-2 rounds), always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.

1. **Initial Move**: The strategy starts by Cooperating in the first round to observe others' actions without risking immediate payoff loss.
2. **Adaptive Moves**: For subsequent rounds, it calculates the average cooperation rate from recent history (last 3 rounds). If this rate exceeds 50% and the current stock is above a set threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), it defects to exploit others' Cooperation. Otherwise, it continues Cooperating.
3. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last few rounds, it always Defects to maximize immediate payoff since future impacts are negligible.

This approach balances exploitation with maintaining sustainable stock levels for future rounds, ensuring a robust strategy against varied opponents.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_540 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for exploiting others while maintaining sustainability, follow these steps:

1. **Assess Current Stock Level**: Evaluate the current stock relative to its maximum capacity (e.g., 75% or another threshold).

2. **Defect if Stock is High**: If the stock is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), choose to defect. This allows you to gain higher payoffs while others are likely cooperating.

3. **Monitor Stock Trends**: Track changes in the stock over several rounds. If the stock consistently decreases, it may indicate that many players are defecting, leading to resource depletion.

4. **Switch to Cooperation if Necessary**: If the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to cooperation to help replenish the resource and prevent further depletion.

5. **Adapt Dynamically**: Adjust your strategy based on the stock's behavior. Use a dynamic threshold that decreases as the stock decreases, balancing exploitation with sustainability.

6. **Example Thresholds**:
   - Defect if stock > 75% of capacity.
   - Cooperate if stock < 25% of capacity.
   - For intermediate levels, consider defecting less frequently or using a mixed strategy.

By following this approach, you can maximize your short-term gains while ensuring the resource remains sustainable for future exploitation.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1-2):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Reasoning:** Preserve the stock to avoid early depletion and observe opponents' behaviors.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Opponents' Actions:**
     - If more than half of the players defect in consecutive rounds, switch to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs.
     - If most players cooperate, exploit by defecting to gain higher payoffs while others sustain the stock.

3. **Low Stock Threshold (Stock < 50% of Capacity):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Reasoning:** Exploit remaining resources before they are depleted, maximizing immediate gains.

4. **Final Rounds (Last Few Rounds):**
   - **Approach the Endgame:**
     - In the last two rounds, increase defection frequency to capitalize on what's left.
     - **Last Round (Round r):** Always Defect (D) as there are no future rounds for punishment.

5. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Adjust strategy based on opponents' actions and stock levels. If defecting leads to rapid depletion, consider brief periods of cooperation to rejuvenate the stock slightly before resuming exploitation.

6. **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```
threshold = 0.5 * capacity

for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1 or t == 2:
        action = C
    else:
        count_defect = number of players who played D last round
        stock_level = current stock
        
        if stock_level < threshold:
            action = D
        elif count_defect > n / 2:
            action = D
        elif t >= r - 1:  # Last two rounds
            action = D
        else:
            action = C
    play action
```

**Conclusion:** This strategy balances immediate exploitation with maintaining resources for future gains, adapting dynamically to opponents' actions and stock levels. It ensures maximization of payoffs while being robust against various opponent behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative baseline and allows observation of other players' actions without immediate risk.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Analyze the previous round's actions:
     - If more than half of the players Defected, respond by Defecting (D) in this round.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate (C) to maintain a stable stock for future gains.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**

**Considerations:**

- The strategy is adaptive, responding to others' actions while considering the current stock level.
- By defecting in the last round, it maximizes immediate gain, exploiting any remaining resources without regard for future sustainability since no subsequent rounds exist.

This approach balances cooperation for mutual benefit with defecting when advantageous, effectively exploiting opponents' strategies in a tournament setting.

### Explanation
- **Initial Rounds:** The strategy starts by cooperating to gather information about others' behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Start with cooperation in the first few rounds to encourage a stable environment and maintain a healthy stock level for growth.

2. **Detection of Defectors:**
   - Monitor other players' actions each round. Calculate expected consumption based on current stock and detect deviations indicating potential defection.
   - Use thresholds to identify defectors, adjusting expectations dynamically as the game progresses.

3. **Dynamic Exploitation:**
   - In mid-game rounds, balance between exploiting detected defectors by defecting more against them while maintaining some cooperation to sustain resource levels.
   - Adjust own defection probability based on the number of detected defectors and current stock dynamics.

4. **Endgame Exploitation:**
   - Increase defection towards the end of the game when future rounds are limited, focusing on maximizing immediate gains without worrying about long-term sustainability.

5. **Stock Management:**
   - Monitor stock levels closely to prevent over-depletion. Adjust cooperation and defection rates as necessary to maintain a healthy resource level for continued growth.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def strategy(history):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    current_round = len(history)
    initial_coop_rounds = 3

    if current_round == 0:

    # Calculate defection probability based on detected defectors

This strategy adaptively balances exploitation with maintaining resource sustainability, dynamically adjusting based on opponent behavior and game progression to maximize individual payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_545 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing payoff while considering resource sustainability, we propose a strategic approach that balances exploitation with preservation based on the current stock level.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Observation:** Begin each round by noting the current stock level (S) and the total capacity (C).

2. **Threshold Determination:** Establish a threshold at 75% of the capacity (0.75 * C). This threshold serves as a marker to decide between exploiting or preserving the resource.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - If the current stock (S) exceeds the threshold (0.75 * C), choose to Defect. This action maximizes immediate payoff by taking advantage of the abundant resources.
   - Conversely, if S is at or below the threshold, opt to Cooperate. This preserves the resource base for future rounds, ensuring that the stock remains sustainable.

4. **Implementation:** Apply this decision consistently across all rounds, adjusting actions based on whether the current stock surpasses or falls short of the predetermined threshold.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is:

- **Defect** when the current stock exceeds 75% of the capacity.
- **Cooperate** otherwise.

This approach allows for maximizing immediate gains while maintaining resource levels to sustain future payoffs, balancing exploitation and preservation effectively.

$\boxed{\text{Defect if current stock > 0.75 \times capacity, else Cooperate}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_546 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing individual payoff by adapting to current game conditions and opponents' behaviors. The strategy balances exploitation of cooperative players with cooperation to prevent resource collapse.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Adaptive Exploitation:**
   - In each round, assess the stock level relative to capacity.
   - If the stock is high and many opponents are cooperating, defect to gain higher immediate payoffs.
   - Transition to cooperation if the stock is low or decreasing rapidly to prevent resource depletion.

2. **Dynamic Thresholding:**
   - Use a dynamic threshold based on current stock levels and recent opponent actions.
   - Adjust the threshold each round using moving averages of past trends (e.g., last 3-5 rounds) for responsiveness.

3. **Endgame Exploitation:**
   - In the last few rounds (when r_remaining ≤ 10% of total rounds), prioritize defecting to maximize immediate gains without concern for future repercussions.

4. **Early Round Adaptation:**
   - Start with a balanced approach, observing opponents' initial moves.
   - Use the first few rounds to gather data on opponent strategies before fully committing to an exploitative pattern.

5. **Risk Management:**
   - Monitor stock growth trends; if growth is consistently low despite cooperation, consider defecting less to encourage sustainability and higher future payoffs.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def decide_action(state, history, parameters):
    # Extract current state variables
    stock = state.stock
    capacity = parameters.capacity
    n = parameters.n
    r_remaining = parameters.r - state.round

    # Determine if in endgame phase
    is_endgame = r_remaining <= 0.1 * parameters.r  # Adjust threshold as needed

    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among opponents
    recent_rounds = min(5, len(history))  # Look back up to last 5 rounds
    opp_coop_rate = sum([sum(action == 'C' for action in round_actions) for round_actions in history[-recent_rounds:]]) / (n * recent_rounds)

    # Dynamic threshold based on stock level and opponent cooperation
    if stock > 0.7 * capacity:  # High stock, exploit
        if opp_coop_rate > 0.5:
            return 'D'
    elif stock < 0.3 * capacity:  # Low stock, prevent collapse
        return 'C'
    else:  # Mid-range stock, balance exploitation and cooperation
        if is_endgame:
            return 'D'  # Exploit in endgame
        else:
            return 'D' if random.random() < max(0.5 - (1 - opp_coop_rate)*0.3, 0.2) else 'C'

    # Default action if none triggered
    return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Adaptive Exploitation:** The strategy exploits cooperative opponents when the stock is high, maximizing immediate gains.
- **Dynamic Thresholding:** Adjusts based on recent trends to stay responsive to changing conditions and opponent strategies.
- **Endgame Focus:** Prioritizes defecting in the final rounds to squeeze out maximum payoffs without worrying about future rounds.
- **Risk Management:** Switches to cooperation when necessary to prevent resource collapse, ensuring sustainable exploitation opportunities.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to exploit opponents while managing risk.

In a multi-player scenario where the goal is to maximize individual payoff while considering the sustainability of the shared resource, the optimal strategy as an AI would involve a balance between cooperation and defection based on the current state of the resource and the behavior of other players. However, in the absence of prior information about others' strategies or multiple rounds, a prudent initial approach is to cooperate to avoid depleting the resource prematurely.

Thus, the answer is:

$\boxed{C}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_548 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff in a repeated game where players can either cooperate or defect, affecting the shared resource (stock). The goal is to exploit others' cooperation while preserving enough of the resource for future exploitation.

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 30% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Defect** if the current stock is above a high threshold (T_high = 75% of capacity) or below a low threshold (T_low = 25%).
   - **Cooperate** if the stock is between T_high and T_low.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 40% of Total Rounds):**
   - Continue using the same thresholds as in the initial rounds:
     - Defect above T_high or below T_low.
     - Cooperate in between.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 30% of Total Rounds):**
   - Always **Defect** to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always defect since the stock is at full capacity, providing maximum payoff.
   - **Last Round:** Defect regardless of stock level.
   - **Stock Near Capacity or Very Low:** Follow the above thresholds accordingly.

### **Rationale:**

- **Early Exploitation:** By defecting when the stock is high, you exploit others' cooperation while allowing significant regrowth in subsequent rounds due to high growth rates at substantial S_remaining levels. Defecting when the stock is low leverages rapid regrowth after consumption.
  
- **Sustainability in Middle Rounds:** Cooperating when the stock is moderate helps maintain a balance, ensuring that the resource doesn't deplete too quickly, allowing for continued exploitation in later rounds.

- **Maximizing Final Payoff:** In the last few rounds, defecting maximizes immediate gains without worrying about future impacts since there are no subsequent rounds to be affected.

### **Dynamic Adjustments:**

While the strategy uses fixed thresholds for simplicity, monitoring past stock levels and adjusting T_high and T_low dynamically based on observed trends could enhance effectiveness. However, maintaining simplicity is prioritized for clarity and ease of implementation.

### **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Determine Thresholds:**
   - T_high = 0.75 * Capacity
   - T_low = 0.25 * Capacity

2. **Calculate Round Segments:**
   - Early Rounds: First 30% of total rounds.
   - Middle Rounds: Next 40%.
   - Late Rounds: Last 30%.

3. **Apply Decision Rules Based on Current Round and Stock Level:**
   - For each round, check its segment (early, middle, late) and the current stock level to decide between Cooperate or Defect.

### **Conclusion:**

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with sustainable resource management, ensuring maximum cumulative payoff over all rounds by adapting actions based on the game's progression and resource state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_549 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to maximize our own payoff while adapting to the dynamics of the game and the behaviors of other players. The strategy should exploit others' cooperation when beneficial but also preserve the resource when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to observe others' actions without risking early depletion.
2. **Adaptive Exploitation**:
   - Monitor recent cooperation rates among other players and the current stock level.
   - If others are mostly cooperating and the stock is sufficiently high, defect to gain a higher immediate payoff.
3. **Preservation When Necessary**: Cooperate if the stock is low or if others are defecting excessively to avoid rapid resource depletion.
4. **Endgame Exploitation**: In the last few rounds, prioritize defecting when possible to maximize short-term gains.

### Decision Rules:

- **First Round**: Cooperate to gather information without significant risk.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Evaluate recent cooperation rates (last 3 rounds) and current stock level relative to a threshold (75% of capacity).
  - Defect if others cooperate often and the stock is above the threshold; otherwise, cooperate.
- **Endgame**: In the last few rounds, defect if the stock allows to maximize immediate payoff.

### Edge Cases:

- **First Round**: Default to cooperation.
- **Low Stock**: Cooperate to prevent further depletion.
- **High Defection Rate Among Others**: Switch to cooperation to avoid mutual resource exhaustion.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate first round to observe others
    else:
        recent_rounds = min(3, len(history))  # Look at last 3 rounds or all available history
        other_players_actions = [h['actions'] for h in history[-recent_rounds:]]
        total_coop = sum([sum(a == 'C' for a in round_actions) for round_actions in other_players_actions])
        avg_coop_per_player = total_coop / (n-1)  # Average cooperation rate per opponent

        if current_stock > threshold and avg_coop_per_player > 0.7:  
            return 'D'  
        elif round_number >= r - 2:  
            if current_stock > threshold:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by cooperating to gather information about others' behaviors without risking early resource depletion.
- **Adaptive Exploitation**: By monitoring cooperation rates and the stock level, the strategy decides when it's beneficial to defect (exploit) while others cooperate. This balances immediate gains with sustainable resource management.
- **Preservation Mechanism**: When the stock is low or other players are defecting excessively, cooperation preserves the resource for future rounds, leveraging its growth potential.
- **Endgame Focus**: In the final rounds, defecting maximizes short-term payoffs since there's no need to preserve resources for an undefined future.

This strategy effectively adapts to different game states and opponent behaviors, aiming to exploit when advantageous while ensuring long-term sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_550 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to maximize immediate payoffs while considering future sustainability. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy balances exploitation with preservation, adapting based on current stock levels and historical player behavior.

#### 1. Initial Exploration
- **First Round:** Defect to test others' reactions.
  
#### 2. Dynamic Exploitation
For each subsequent round:
- **Current Stock Check:** If the stock is above 80% of capacity, proceed to exploit.
- **Defection Rate Analysis:** Review historical data to estimate how many players will defect this round.
- **Decision Making:**
  - **Exploit (Defect):** If fewer than half of players are defecting and the stock is healthy.
  - **Preserve (Cooperate):** If too many players are defecting or the stock is strained.

#### 3. Terminal Rounds
- In the last 10% of rounds, prioritize defecting to maximize immediate gains without concern for future rounds.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Defection:** Start by defecting in the first round to assess others' behavior.
2. **Stock Monitoring:** Continuously track stock levels relative to capacity (80% threshold).
3. **Defector Estimation:** Use historical data to predict current round defectors.
4. **Decision Logic:**
   - If conditions for exploitation are met, defect.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to preserve resources.

### Edge Cases Handling
- **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate if stock is near zero to avoid exacerbating depletion.
- **Late Rounds:** Defect in the final rounds regardless of stock to capitalize on immediate payoffs.

This strategy effectively exploits when possible while preserving resources for future exploitation, adapting dynamically to opponent behaviors and game state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_551 = '''
To address the problem of designing an AI strategy for maximizing payoffs in a common pool resource game, we'll outline a step-by-step approach. The strategy balances immediate gains from defecting with the need to preserve resources by cooperating when necessary.

### Approach
1. **Initial Defection**: Begin by defecting to capitalize on the high initial stock.
2. **Threshold-Based Cooperation**: If the current stock drops below 70% of capacity, switch to cooperation to aid recovery and prevent rapid depletion.
3. **Adaptation to Opponents' Actions**: Monitor opponents' previous actions. If more than half of them defected last round, cooperate to mitigate collective resource depletion.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history):
    # Define the capacity (assuming it's given or known)
    capacity = current_stock  # Adjust based on actual knowledge
    
    if len(history) == 0:
        # First round: defect
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Check if stock is below cooperation threshold
        cooperation_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
        if current_stock < cooperation_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Get opponent actions from the last round
            last_round_actions = history[-1]['actions']

            defect_count = sum(1 for a in last_round_actions if a == 'D')
            
            # If more than half are defecting, switch to C
            if defect_count / num_opponents > 0.5:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Defection**: The AI starts by defecting to maximize immediate payoff.
- **Stock Threshold Check**: If the current stock falls below 70% of capacity, cooperation is chosen to support resource recovery and prevent collapse.
- **Opponent Behavior Adaptation**: By monitoring opponents' actions, the AI adapts its strategy. If a majority defects, cooperation helps mitigate rapid depletion.

This approach ensures a balance between exploiting the resource for immediate gains and preserving it for sustainable future benefits.

### Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

#### Overview
The goal of this strategy is to maximize individual payoff while exploiting opponents' behaviors. It leverages feedback from previous rounds and adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on current stock levels and observed opponent actions.

---

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to encourage others to cooperate, which helps preserve the resource for future exploitation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Observe the average consumption rate from previous rounds to infer how many players are defecting or cooperating.
   - If the current stock is above a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), defect to exploit others' cooperation.
   - If the stock is below the threshold, cooperate more frequently to prevent rapid depletion and sustain future exploitation opportunities.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Defect unconditionally in the last round since there are no future rounds to penalize for over-consumption.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - After each round, update your understanding of opponents' behavior based on their actions and payoffs.
   - If many players defect, start defecting more frequently to take advantage of their greed before the stock crashes.

### Exploitation Opportunities

1. **Exploit Cooperators:**
   - When others cooperate (lower consumption), defect to gain a higher payoff while preserving the resource for future exploitation.

2. **Exploit Defectors:**
   - If most players defect, start cooperating occasionally to prevent rapid depletion and prolong your ability to exploit their behavior.

---

### Edge Cases

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate to set a cooperative baseline and encourage others to maintain the resource.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Defect unconditionally since there are no future rounds to worry about resource preservation.

3. **Stock Near Capacity:**
   - If the stock is near capacity, defect more frequently to exploit others' cooperation while maintaining sustainability.

4. **Stock Near Depletion:**
   - Cooperate more to prevent rapid depletion and sustain your ability to exploit opponents in subsequent rounds.

---

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = maximum_sustainable_level
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round to encourage others
        
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return "D"  # Defect unconditionally in the last round
    
    else:
        average_stock = calculate_average_stock(history)
        threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # Adjust based on empirical testing
        
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return "D"  # Exploit others' cooperation
        else:
            if count_defectors(history) > n/2:
                return "C"  # Cooperate to prevent rapid depletion
            else:
                return "D"  # Exploit cooperators
            
def calculate_average_stock(history):
    # Calculate the average stock level from previous rounds
    pass

def count_defectors(history):
    # Count how many players have been defecting recently
    pass
```

---

### Summary
This strategy is designed to exploit opponents by balancing cooperation and defection based on current stock levels, observed behavior, and game dynamics. It adapts dynamically to maximize individual payoff while preventing rapid resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_553 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and sustainability in a repeated resource management scenario, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy involves starting with cooperation to maintain a high initial stock. In subsequent rounds, decisions are based on the current stock level relative to a threshold (80% of capacity). If the stock is above this threshold, defecting maximizes immediate payoff; otherwise, cooperating helps regrow the resource. In the final round, defecting ensures maximum payoff with no future considerations.

### Decision Rules
1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate to maintain a high initial stock, facilitating exploitation in later rounds.
   
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - If current stock \( S > 0.8 \times \text{capacity} \):
     - Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - Else:
     - Cooperate to help regrow the resource and prevent collapse.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Defect for maximum payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Rationale
- Starting with cooperation ensures a robust initial resource base, which can be exploited in subsequent rounds if others continue to cooperate.
- The threshold (80% of capacity) balances exploiting when the resource is abundant and cooperating when it's depleted. This prevents rapid collapse while allowing higher payoffs during prosperous periods.
- Defecting in the final round captures maximum possible payoff without concern for future sustainability.

### Conclusion
This strategy effectively navigates the trade-off between immediate gains and long-term resource health, leveraging cooperation to sustain resources and defection to maximize exploitation when feasible.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_554 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that maximizes immediate gains while considering the game's dynamics, we can outline the following approach:

---

### **Exploitative Strategy: "Defend and Exploit"**

#### **Objective**
Maximize individual payoff by exploiting others' cooperative behavior when possible, while preserving the resource to sustain future gains.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Exploration (First 25% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reasoning: Gather information on other players' strategies without significantly depleting the stock.

2. **Middle Phase (From Round 26% to 75% of Total Rounds):**
   - Determine the number of defecting players in the previous round.
   - If more than half of the players are Cooperating:
     - **Action:** Defect (D)
       - Reasoning: Exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate payoff.
   - If most players are defecting:
     - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
       - Reasoning: Preserve the stock to sustain future payoffs.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Reasoning: Exploit whatever remaining stock is available for maximum immediate gain, as future rounds no longer matter.

4. **Stock Level Threshold Adjustment:**
   - If the current stock level (S) drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity):
     - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
       - Reasoning: Prevent further resource depletion and allow some recovery for potential future gains.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(S, history, round_number, r, n, capacity):
    # Initial exploration phase
    if round_number < r / 4:
        return 'C'
    
    # Late rounds: exploit remaining stock
    if round_number > 3 * r / 4:
        return 'D'
    
    # Check stock level for preservation
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    if S < threshold:
        return 'C'
    
    # Determine others' actions in previous round
    prev_defectors = sum(history[-1] == 'D')
    majority_cooperate = (prev_defectors / n) < 0.5
    
    if majority_cooperate:
        return 'D'  # Exploit cooperative players
    else:
        return 'C'  # Preserve resource when others defect
```

---

### **Explanation**

- The strategy begins by Cooperating to observe other players' behavior without risking significant resource depletion.
- During the middle phase, it adapts based on others' actions: Defecting when others Cooperate to exploit their kindness and Cooperating when others Defect to preserve the resource.
- In the final quarter of rounds, it switches to always Defecting to maximize immediate gains, disregarding future consequences as they no longer matter.
- A stock threshold ensures that the strategy preserves resources when necessary, balancing exploitation with sustainability for continued gains.

This approach effectively leverages others' behavior while managing resource depletion to sustain long-term payoff potential.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_555 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (Early Game):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate in the first round to sustain a high stock level and gather information on other players' strategies.

2. **Mid Game:**
   - **Monitor Stock Trends:** Track changes in the stock level each round. If the stock decreases significantly or if many players start Defecting, increase the likelihood of defecting.
   - **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Set an initial threshold (e.g., 0.75 * capacity). Adjust this threshold based on observed behavior and stock trends.

3. **Late Rounds (Endgame):**
   - **Action:** Switch to always Defecting in the last quarter of the game (last 25% of rounds) to maximize immediate gains without concern for future sustainability.

4. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above an adjusted threshold and it's not the endgame.
   - Defect if the stock falls below the threshold or in the last quarter of rounds.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to observe others' behavior.
   - **Last Round (Round r):** Definitely Defect to exploit remaining resources without future concerns.
   - **Stock Near Capacity/Depletion:** Cooperate if near capacity; defect if low, as others might be doing the same.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, previous_rounds):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # Initial threshold

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'

    if round_number > 0.75 * r:
        return 'D'

    delta = current_stock - previous_rounds[-1]['stock']
    if delta < 0:
        # Stock is decreasing; increase chance of defecting
        threshold *= 0.9

    num_defectors = sum(1 for actions in previous_rounds if 'D' in actions)
    if num_defectors / n > 0.5:
        return 'D'

    if current_stock < threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy starts by Cooperating to maintain a high stock level and observe others.
- It dynamically adjusts the cooperation threshold based on stock trends and observed Defectors.
- In the late game, it switches to always Defecting to maximize immediate gains.
- This approach balances exploitation with sustainability until the endgame, ensuring maximum payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_556 = '''
To exploit others effectively while managing resource risk, follow this organized strategy:

### Exploitation Strategy with Risk Management

1. **Initial Exploration (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect in the initial rounds to assess others' behavior and test their reactions.

2. **Monitoring Parameters:**
   - **Defection Rate (D_rate):** Calculate the proportion of opponents who defected in the last `k` rounds (e.g., 3).
   - **Current Stock Level (S):** Track the current stock relative to capacity.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Thresholds:**
     - **threshold_low:** 25% of capacity.
     - **threshold_defect:** 60% defection rate among opponents.
   - **Conditions for Cooperation:**
     - If `S < threshold_low` (stock is critically low), switch to Cooperate.
     - If `D_rate > threshold_defect`, indicating potential crash, switch to Cooperate.
   - **Default Action:** Defect if neither condition above is met.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - **Trend Analysis:** Optionally, monitor trends (e.g., rapid stock decrease) and adjust thresholds dynamically to anticipate crashes earlier.

### Summary

- Start by defecting to observe others' behavior.
- Use `D_rate` and current stock level to decide between defecting or cooperating.
- Switch to Cooperate when the stock is critically low or when a high proportion of opponents are defecting, preventing resource crashes.

This strategy balances short-term exploitation with long-term sustainability.

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents' behavior while considering the game's dynamics and state.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First few rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Reasoning:** Encourages a cooperative environment and maintains a healthy stock level for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Opponents' Behavior:**
     - Calculate the cooperation rate among opponents from previous rounds.
   - **Assess Stock Level:**
     - Determine if the current stock is above a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
   - **Adapt Strategy:**
     - If cooperation rate exceeds 60% and stock remains healthy, continue Cooperating.
     - If cooperation rate drops below 40% or stock falls below the threshold, switch to Defecting (D) to exploit opportunities for higher immediate payoffs.

3. **Final Few Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect (D)
   - **Reasoning:** No future impact; maximize payoff by defecting without regard to long-term consequences.

4. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - If the stock is above a certain threshold, Cooperate.
   - If below, increase the rate of Defection to capitalize on potential declines caused by others' actions.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Default to Cooperate (C) with no prior history.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.
- **Very Low Stock:** Prioritize Defecting (D) to exploit the situation and secure higher payoffs despite potential stock depletion.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_round, total_rounds, capacity, stock):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate cooperation rate among opponents in previous rounds
        total_actions = len(history)
        cooperation_rate = sum(1 for action in history if action == 'C') / total_actions
        
        remaining_rounds = total_rounds - current_round + 1
        stock_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
        
        # Check if it's the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%)
        if remaining_rounds <= 0.1 * total_rounds:
            return 'D'

            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

**Conclusion:** This strategy adaptively balances between Cooperating to maintain a sustainable resource level and Defecting to exploit opportunities, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors across different game dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_558 = '''
To address the problem of determining the optimal strategy for maximizing payoff in a repeated resource management scenario, we propose a decision-making framework that adapts based on current conditions and historical behavior. The solution involves balancing exploitation (defection) with cooperation to maintain sustainable resource levels.

### Approach
The proposed strategy is divided into three phases, each tailored to different stages of the game:

1. **Early Phase (First 20% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Build a foundation of cooperation to encourage mutual benefits and allow the resource stock to be replenished.

2. **Middle Phase (Next 50% of Rounds):**
   - **Decision Criteria:**
     - **Current Stock Level (S):** If S is above 80% of capacity, defect to exploit the abundance.
     - **Recent Cooperation Rate:** Track cooperation levels in recent rounds. If more than 70% of players have cooperated recently, switch to cooperation to maintain resource sustainability.

3. **Late Phase (Last 30% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff as there's no future punishment for defection in the final rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(S, history, round_number, total_rounds, capacity):
    n = number_of_players  # Assume this is defined elsewhere
    
    # Calculate thresholds based on capacity
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    
    # Determine phase based on current round
    early_phase_end = int(total_rounds * 0.2)
    late_phase_start = int(total_rounds * 0.7)
    
    if round_number <= early_phase_end:
        # Early phase: Cooperate to build up cooperation and stock
        return 'C'
    elif round_number >= late_phase_start:
        # Late phase: Defect to maximize immediate payoff
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Middle phase: Decide based on current S and recent cooperation
        recent_coop = calculate_recent_cooperation(history, n)
        
        if S > high_threshold:
            # Stock is high; exploit by defecting
            return 'D'
        elif S < low_threshold or recent_coop > 0.7:
            # Low stock or high cooperation; cooperate to preserve
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Mix of decisions based on some probability
            import random
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'

def calculate_recent_cooperation(history, n):
    # Calculate average cooperation rate in recent rounds (e.g., last 10)
    recent_rounds = min(len(history), 10)
    total_coop = sum(action == 'C' for player_actions in history[-recent_rounds:] for action in player_actions)
    return total_coop / (n * recent_rounds) if recent_rounds > 0 else 0
```

### Explanation
- **Early Phase:** By defaulting to cooperation, the strategy encourages others to also cooperate, fostering a sustainable environment where resources can replenish.
- **Middle Phase:** The strategy dynamically adapts based on current resource levels and recent behavior. High cooperation rates prompt continued cooperation to maintain sustainability, while high stock levels allow for exploitation without severe consequences.
- **Late Phase:** As future rounds diminish in importance, defecting maximizes immediate gains, reflecting the absence of long-term repercussions.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring optimal payoff while considering the collective behavior of other players.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_559 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance exploiting the common pool for immediate gains while preserving it for sustained exploitation in future rounds. The strategy adapts based on others' behavior and the evolving state of the stock.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1-3):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning:** Observe others' behavior without immediately exploiting too much, allowing assessment of their strategies while keeping the stock high.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitoring:** Track the number of Defectors each round.
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If fewer than 30% of players Defect, defect to gain higher immediate payoffs.
     - If more than 30% Defect, cooperate to prevent further stock depletion.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect as much as possible.
   - **Reasoning:** Maximize immediate gains since future payoffs are limited.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - After each round, adjust the defecting threshold based on stock changes and consumption rates.
   - If the stock is declining rapidly, increase Cooperate actions to preserve it; if stable or growing, maintain or lower the defecting threshold.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to observe without early depletion.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Defect more to maximize immediate gains.
   - **Stock Near Capacity:** Defect as it provides higher payoff without risking immediate depletion.

### Conclusion:
The strategy begins with cooperation to assess others' strategies, then adapts by exploiting when safe and preserving the resource when necessary. In later rounds, it prioritizes immediate gains through defection while ensuring enough resource remains for continued exploitation. This balanced approach allows sustained exploitation without total depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_560 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Behavior:**
   - In the first round, Cooperate (C) to observe others' behavior and establish a baseline.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - For each subsequent round:
     - Calculate the current cooperation rate among opponents.
     - If the stock is above 75% of capacity and more than half of opponents are Cooperating, Defect (D).
     - Otherwise, Cooperate (C) to help maintain or regrow the stock.

3. **Final Rounds:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds, switch to always Defecting (D) since future impacts are irrelevant.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, capacity, n_players, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate among opponents
    last_round_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    cooperation_count = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions if action == 'C')
    cooperation_rate = cooperation_count / n_players
    
    # Check stock level and cooperation rate
    if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity and cooperation_rate > 0.5:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# In the last few rounds, defect aggressively
total_rounds = r
last_10_percent = total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10)
if round_number >= last_10_percent:
    return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperate:** Starts by Cooperating to observe others' strategies without immediately exploiting the resource.
- **Adaptive Exploitation:** Monitors cooperation rates and stock levels. If others are Cooperating while the stock is healthy, defects to maximize immediate gains.
- **Stock Management:** Maintains or regrows the stock when necessary by Cooperating, preventing over-depletion that would harm future payoffs.
- **Final Rounds Defect:** In the final 10%, defects aggressively to exploit any remaining resource without concern for future rounds.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, ensuring high immediate gains while preserving resources for continued exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_561 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategic approach that balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by considering both the current state of the system (stock level) and the cooperative behavior observed among other players. Here's a structured breakdown of the strategy:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Early Rounds (First 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Always Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Building up the stock in the initial rounds ensures that there is enough resource to sustain future gains and allows for growth through the system's dynamics.

2. **Mid Game (Remaining 80% of Rounds):**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players over the last `k` rounds (e.g., `k=3` or `k=5`).
   - **Step 2:** Evaluate the current stock level.
     - **If Current Stock > 70% Capacity AND Others' Cooperation Rate > 50%:**
       - **Action:** Defect.
       - **Rationale:** Exploit others' willingness to cooperate by defecting, which increases your consumption while keeping total depletion manageable due to their cooperative actions.
     - **Else If Current Stock < 30% Capacity OR Others' Cooperation Rate < 40%:**
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
       - **Rationale:** Sustain or rebuild the stock when it's low or others are defecting more, preventing rapid depletion and fostering a healthier resource pool for future rounds.
     - **Else (Stock Between 30%-70% AND Cooperation Rate Between 40%-50%):**
       - **Action:** Use a weighted decision model:
         - Compute scores based on stock level and cooperation rate.
         - Apply weights to these scores (e.g., stock level weight: 0.6, cooperation rate weight: 0.4).
         - If the combined score exceeds a predefined threshold, Defect; otherwise, Cooperate.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **If Current Stock > 50% Capacity:**
     - **Action:** Defect.
     - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate gains in the final stages when there's still sufficient resource to exploit without risking collapse.
   - **Else:**
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Rationale:** Allow any remaining growth potential, ensuring a smoother transition or wrapping up of the game.

### Adjustable Parameters

- **`k`:** The number of past rounds considered for calculating cooperation rates (e.g., 3 or 5).
- **Stock Thresholds:** Percentages such as 70%, 50%, and 30% can be adjusted based on simulation results.
- **Weights:** Values assigned to stock level and cooperation rate in the weighted decision model (e.g., 0.6 for stock, 0.4 for cooperation).
- **Cooperation Rate Thresholds:** Percentages like 50% and 40% can be tuned to optimize performance against different opponent strategies.

### Conclusion

This strategy effectively balances exploitation with conservation, ensuring that you maximize your gains while maintaining a sustainable resource level. By dynamically adapting to the observed behavior of others and the current system state, this approach is robust against various playstyles and ensures long-term viability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_562 = '''
To maximize your payoff while considering resource sustainability, employ an adaptive strategy that exploits when advantageous and cooperates to maintain resources:

1. **Initial Move**: Start by Cooperating in the first round.

2. **Early/Mid Game (Rounds 2 to 80% of total rounds)**:
   - **Assess Stock Level**: If current stock > capacity/2, proceed.
   - **Evaluate Last Round's Cooperation**: If more than half of players Cooperated last round, Defect to exploit their cooperation.
   - **Otherwise**, Cooperate.

3. **Late Game (Last 20% of rounds)**:
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff regardless of sustainability.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; defect when others cooperate and stock is high, especially in late rounds}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_563 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Exploiter (AE)

**Objective:** Maximize immediate and future payoffs through exploitative actions while adapting to stock dynamics and opponent behaviors.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1 to r/2):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: High stock levels allow for higher immediate payoffs from defecting without significant long-term harm.
     - Exception: If the number of defectors in previous rounds is high, switch to Cooperate (C) to prevent stock depletion.

2. **Mid Rounds (Rounds r/2 + 1 to r-2):**
   - **Action:** Defect if S > Threshold (T), else Cooperate.
     - **Threshold (T):** T = capacity * 0.6
     - Rationale: Maintain exploitation when the stock is sustainable, switch to cooperation if stock drops below T to allow recovery.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 2 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect in the penultimate round.
     - Rationale: Exploit remaining stock for higher immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
   - **Action in Last Round:** Always Defect (D)
     - Rationale: No future rounds, so maximize immediate gain.

---

### **Adaptation Mechanisms:**

1. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Track the stock level after each round to determine if it's above or below T.
   - If stock drops below T in any round, switch to Cooperate for the next 2 rounds to encourage recovery.

2. **Opponent Behavior Analysis:**
   - Count the number of defectors (D) from previous rounds.
   - If D > n/2 in two consecutive rounds, assume aggressive exploitation and switch to Cooperate temporarily to prevent collapse.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Exploit the high initial stock for maximum immediate payoff.

2. **Stock Collapse (S ≤ 0):**
   - If S reaches zero, all players cooperate in subsequent rounds to rebuild the stock.
     - Rationale: Prevent perpetual collapse by allowing the stock to recover through cooperation.

---

### **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initialize Parameters:**
   - Set Threshold (T) = capacity * 0.6
   - Track stock levels and number of defectors each round.

2. **Each Round Decision:**
   - If current round is in Initial Rounds:
     - Defect unless previous rounds indicate high defection rates leading to low stock.
   - If in Mid Rounds:
     - Defect if S > T; else, Cooperate.
   - If in Final Rounds:
     - Defect.

3. **Adjust Based on Stock and Opponents:**
   - After each round, update stock level and count of defectors.
   - Adjust strategy dynamically based on whether stock is above/below T and opponent behavior trends.

---

### **Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock, history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = initial_stock
    threshold = capacity * 0.6

    if is_mid_game(current_round, total_rounds):

    defectors_count = count_defectors(history)
    if defectors_count > n / 2 in last_two_rounds:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

### **Conclusion:**

The Adaptive Exploiter strategy balances immediate exploitation with adaptive cooperation to sustain the resource. It dynamically adjusts based on stock levels and opponent behavior, ensuring high payoffs while mitigating risks of collapse. This approach is robust against various opponent strategies and effectively navigates edge cases for optimal performance in the tournament.

To determine whether to defect or cooperate based on the current stock level, we can use the following strategy:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Calculate the Threshold:** Determine a threshold stock level above which it is beneficial to defect. A common heuristic is to set this threshold at approximately 70% of the maximum capacity (C). For example, if the maximum capacity is 100 units, the threshold would be 70 units.

2. **Compare Current Stock with Threshold:** Check if the current stock level is above or below this threshold.
   - If the current stock > threshold: Choose to **defect** because the resource is abundant enough that your individual defection won't deplete it too much, and the system can recover through growth.
   - If the current stock ≤ threshold: Choose to **cooperate** to preserve the resource for future rounds and prevent over-depletion.

3. **Adjust Based on Observations:** While this strategy works well as a heuristic, in real scenarios, you might also consider historical data or the behavior of other players to fine-tune your decisions. However, since we don't have information about others' strategies here, sticking with the threshold is a safe approach.

**Final Answer:**

To decide between defecting and cooperating:

- **If the current stock level exceeds 70% of the maximum capacity (C):** Defect.
- **Otherwise:** Cooperate.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock} \leq 0.7C; \text{Defect otherwise}}$

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff while exploiting others' cooperation and maintaining sustainability through dynamic adaptation.

---

### **Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Encourages others to cooperate, fostering a sustainable resource base.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1: Calculate Average Cooperation Rate (CR) of Other Players from Previous Round.**
     - CR = (Number of Cooperators / Total Players).
   
   - **Step 2: Determine Threshold for Defection.**
     - Start with a default threshold (e.g., 0.5). Adjust dynamically based on past outcomes.
   
   - **Step 3: Decision Based on CR and Stock Level.**
     - If CR > Current Threshold:
       - **Action:** Defect to exploit others' cooperation.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate to maintain or rebuild the stock.

3. **Final Few Rounds (Last Round and r-1):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

---

### **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**

- **Adaptation Based on Payoff Trends:**
  - After each round, assess if defecting increased your payoff without causing significant stock depletion.
  - If defecting is profitable and stock remains above a safe level (e.g., 30% of capacity), lower the threshold to exploit more aggressively.
  - If defecting leads to significant stock drops or reduced future payoffs, raise the threshold to cooperate more.

- **Stock Level Consideration:**
  - Set a minimum safe stock level (e.g., 30% of capacity).
  - If current stock < Safe Level:
    - **Action:** Cooperate to allow recovery.
  - Else:
    - Follow cooperation rate-based decision rule.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:**
  - Always cooperate to encourage sustainability.

- **Last Few Rounds (Final 2-3 rounds):**
  - Always defect to maximize immediate payoff.

- **Stock Depletion Scenario:**
  - If stock drops significantly due to high defection rates:
    - **Action:** Switch to cooperating in the next round(s) to rebuild the stock.

---

### **Summary of Strategy**

1. **Start by Cooperating** to encourage others and sustain the resource.
2. **Exploit When Possible**: Defect if a sufficient number of others cooperate, maximizing immediate gains.
3. **Sustainability Check**: Monitor stock levels and adjust cooperation accordingly to prevent depletion.
4. **Adapt Dynamically**: Modify exploitation aggressiveness based on past payoffs and stock trends.
5. **Maximize Payoff in Final Rounds** by defecting without concern for future impacts.

---

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Initialize Parameters:**
   - Default threshold (e.g., 0.5).
   - Minimum safe stock level (e.g., 30% of capacity).

2. **Execute Strategy Round-by-Round:**
   - Apply decision rules based on CR and stock levels.
   - Adjust threshold dynamically after each round.

To address the problem of balancing exploitation with preservation of a shared resource, we've developed a strategic approach that considers current stock levels and recent player behavior. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

### Parameters
- **Capacity (C):** Total maximum units of the resource (e.g., 100).
- **Low Threshold (L):** Set at 40% of capacity (0.4*C). If the current stock is below this, players should Cooperate to rebuild the resource.
- **High Threshold (H):** Set at 80% of capacity (0.8*C). If the current stock exceeds this, players can exploit by Defecting.
- **Recent Rounds (m):** The number of past rounds considered for assessing cooperation trends, set at 3.
- **Cooperation Rate Threshold (p):** Players will only Defect if more than 60% of other players' recent actions were Cooperate.

### Decision Process

1. **Assess Current Stock (S):**
   - If S is less than or equal to L (40% of capacity), **Cooperate** to help rebuild the resource.
   - If S exceeds H (80% of capacity), **Defect** as there's sufficient buffer for exploitation without immediate collapse.

2. **Evaluate Mid-Stock Levels:**
   - When S is between 40% and 80% of capacity, analyze recent player behavior:
     - Review the actions of other players over the last `m` (3) rounds.
     - Calculate the percentage of times they Cooperated.
     - If more than `p` (60%) of their actions were Cooperate, **Defect** to exploit while others maintain cooperation.
     - Otherwise, **Cooperate** to prevent further depletion.

### Edge Cases and Refinements

- **Initial Rounds:** Without sufficient history, default to Cooperating until enough data is collected.
- **Retaliation Handling:** If defecting leads others to retaliate by Defecting, the strategy automatically switches back to Cooperate as S drops below H, encouraging resource recovery.

### Strategy Summary

The strategy balances exploitation and preservation based on the current stock level and recent player behavior:

1. **Cooperate** when the resource is scarce (S ≤ 40% of capacity) or when most players are defecting.
2. **Defect** when the resource is abundant (S > 80% of capacity) or when a significant majority of other players have Cooperated recently.

This approach aims to maximize individual gain while maintaining the sustainability of the shared resource over time.

```plaintext
Parameters:
- Capacity (C)
- Low Threshold (L = 0.4*C)
- High Threshold (H = 0.8*C)
- Recent Rounds (m = 3)
- Cooperation Rate Threshold (p = 60%)

Decision Process:
1. If current stock S ≤ L: Cooperate
2. Else if S > H: Defect
3. Else:
    a. For each of the last m rounds, note other players' actions.
    b. Calculate percentage of Cooperate actions among others.
    c. If percentage > p%: Defect
    d. Else: Cooperate

Edge Cases:
- In first m rounds without enough history, default to Cooperate.
- Monitor and adjust strategy if others retaliate after Defection.

Resulting Strategy:
Balance between exploiting when possible (high stock) and cooperating when necessary (low stock or when others defect).
```

This strategic approach ensures a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability by considering both resource levels and player behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_567 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing your payoff while considering future rounds and others' actions, you should:

1. **Exploit Others When They Cooperate**: If in the last round more than half of the players Cooperated, Defect to gain a higher immediate payoff without significantly affecting future stocks due to growth.

2. **Preserve Resources When Many Defect**: If fewer than half of the players Cooperated recently, Cooperate to avoid over-depleting the resource and ensure sustainable payoffs in subsequent rounds.

3. **Maximize Endgame Payoffs**: In the final 10% of rounds, always Defect to capitalize on immediate gains since future payoffs are less significant.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if fewer than half of others Cooperated last round; otherwise, Defect. Always Defect in the last 10% of rounds.}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_568 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance immediate gains with sustainable play, adapting based on opponents' behaviors. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate.
   - **Rationale**: Encourage others to Cooperate by maintaining high stock levels, ensuring future rounds have sustainable payoffs.

2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - **Threshold-Based Action**: Defect if the current stock is above 75% of capacity.
     - **Rationale**: Exploit others' likely Cooperation while keeping the stock manageable for future growth.
   - **Adaptive Adjustment**: If many players start defecting, switch to Cooperating to preserve the stock and allow recovery.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Defect.
   - **Rationale**: Maximize immediate payoffs as future consequences are irrelevant.

4. **Adaptive Component**:
   - **Track Cooperators**: Monitor the percentage of players who Cooperate each round.
   - **Threshold (X%)**: If more than X% (e.g., 60%) Cooperate, defect to exploit their behavior. Otherwise, Cooperate to avoid rapid depletion.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock_level, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    early_rounds = total_rounds * 0.2
    late_rounds_start = total_rounds - (total_rounds * 0.2)
    
    if round_number < early_rounds:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif round_number >= late_rounds_start:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        count_cooperators = sum(action == "Cooperate" for action in history[-1])
        percent_coop = count_cooperators / n
        
        if stock_level > 0.75 * capacity:
            if percent_coop > X%:  # e.g., X=60
                return "Defect"
            else:
                return "Cooperate"
        else:
            if percent_coop < Y%:  # e.g., Y=40
                return "Cooperate"
            else:
                return "Defect"
```

### Summary

This strategy adapts to opponents' behaviors, exploiting when safe and preserving resources when necessary. By balancing immediate gains with sustainability, it aims to maximize payoffs while mitigating risks of resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_569 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff through strategic exploitation of others' behaviors while maintaining sustainable resource levels for future gains.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round (t=1):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Exploit the initial high stock level to gain maximum immediate payoff. This encourages others to cooperate, sustaining the resource for subsequent exploitation.

2. **Middle Rounds (t=2 to t=r-1):**
   - **If Current Stock (S) > Threshold (e.g., 30% of Capacity):**
     - **Action:** Defect (D)
       - Rationale: Exploit when resources are abundant, as others' cooperation sustains the stock.
   - **Else (S ≤ Threshold):**
     - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
       - Rationale: Preserve the resource to prevent rapid depletion and sustain higher growth for future exploitation.

3. **Last Round (t=r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: No future rounds are affected, so maximize immediate payoff regardless of stock level.

---

### **Edge Cases:**

- **First Round Exploitation:**  
  Ensure maximum payoff by defecting early, potentially encouraging others to cooperate in subsequent rounds.
  
- **Last Round Exploitation:**  
  Defect even if the stock is low or depleted, as there are no future consequences for your actions.

- **Stock Near Threshold (e.g., 30% Capacity):**  
  Switch to cooperation if the stock drops below this level to preserve resource sustainability. This prevents total depletion and ensures higher growth rates for potential exploitation in later rounds.

---

### **Rationale:**

- The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.
- By defecting when resources are abundant, you exploit others' cooperation.
- Switching to cooperation when the stock is low preserves the resource, ensuring it remains exploitable in future rounds.
- Defecting in the final round maximizes payoff without concern for subsequent depletion.

This approach ensures a balance between exploitation and preservation, optimizing your total payoff throughout the game.

### **1. Initial Rounds: Cooperation**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C) in the first 2-3 rounds.
- **Rationale:** Preserves stock, allowing higher payoffs in subsequent rounds if others also cooperate or defect cautiously.

---

### **2. Observation and Adaptation**
- **Monitor Opponents' Actions:** Track the number of players choosing Defect (D) each round.
- **Adaptive Strategy:**
  - If >50% of opponents defect, switch to Defect in future rounds to exploit higher immediate payoffs.
  - If most cooperate, continue Cooperating to sustain stock health.

---

### **3. Mid-Rounds: Strategic Defection**
- **Condition:** When observing a significant number of defectors (e.g., >50%).
- **Action:** Switch to Defect to capitalize on higher payoffs while the stock remains sufficient for growth.

---

### **4. Final Round: Exploit and Maximize**
- **Action:** Always Defect in the last round.
- **Rationale:** No future rounds to consider; maximize immediate payoff without concern for resource sustainability.

---

### **5. Threshold Adjustments**
- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust the defecting threshold based on n (number of players) and capacity:
  - Lower thresholds for higher n or lower capacities to prevent premature stock depletion.
  - Higher thresholds for smaller n or larger capacities, allowing more rounds of exploitation.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_574 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on exploiting opponents' cooperative tendencies while ensuring sustainability through dynamic adaptation. Here's the structured approach:

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reason: Build up stock and observe others' behavior to inform future decisions.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Track recent cooperation rates among opponents.
   - **If**:
     - Cooperation rate > 50%
     - Stock > 80% of capacity
     - **Action:** Defect (D) to exploit high stock and others' cooperation.
   - **Else If**:
     - Cooperation rate < 30%
     - Stock < 50% of capacity
     - **Action:** Cooperate (C) to prevent resource crash.

   - **Between 50-80% capacity:** Balance based on others' behavior.
   - **Below 50% capacity:** Prioritize cooperation to sustain resources.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round:**
  - **Action:** Cooperate (C) to contribute to initial stock buildup.
  
- **Last Round:**
  - **Action:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff with no future repercussions.

- **Low Stock in Early Rounds:**
  - Switch to Cooperating more to rebuild the resource base for later gains.

### Exploitation Strategy

Exploit when opponents cooperate and stock is high. Balance defection to avoid crashing the resource, ensuring long-term exploitation potential. Increase defection cautiously as rounds progress, exploiting opponents without ruining future opportunities.

This strategy adapts dynamically, exploiting cooperation while maintaining resource sustainability to maximize payoff over multiple rounds.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_575 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation and conservation in a common pool resource scenario, we propose a strategic approach that leverages the current stock level relative to its capacity. This strategy allows for maximizing immediate gains while ensuring the sustainability of the resource.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Assess Current Stock Level (S):**
   - Begin by determining the current amount of the resource available (S).

2. **Determine Threshold (75% Capacity):**
   - Calculate 75% of the total capacity of the resource. This threshold serves as a guideline for deciding whether to exploit or conserve.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - Compare the current stock level (S) with the calculated threshold.
     - If S is greater than or equal to 75% of capacity:
       - **Choose to Defect:** Exploit the resource by taking more, as the higher stock ensures that growth can replenish it adequately. This maximizes immediate payoff without risking over-depletion.
     - If S is less than 75% of capacity:
       - **Choose to Cooperate:** Conserve the resource by contributing to its sustainability, allowing it to recover and ensuring long-term availability for future exploitation.

4. **Adaptation:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level after each round to adjust your strategy dynamically.
   - If exploiting causes the stock to drop significantly below the threshold, switch to Cooperating to facilitate recovery.
   - Conversely, if the stock remains above the threshold despite Defecting, continue exploiting for higher gains.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy involves balancing exploitation and conservation based on the current stock level relative to a predetermined threshold (75% of capacity). Here's how it works:

- **If the resource stock is at or above 75% of its capacity:** Exploit by defecting, as this allows for higher immediate gains while ensuring the resource can recover.
  
- **If the resource stock falls below 75% of its capacity:** Conserve by cooperating to prevent over-depletion and ensure sustainability.

**Final Answer:**

The strategy is to exploit when the resource is abundant (≥75% capacity) and conserve when it's low (<75% capacity). Therefore, the decision rule is:

- **Defect if S ≥ 0.75 × capacity;**
- **Cooperate otherwise.**

\boxed{\text{Defect if } S \geq 0.75 \times \text{capacity; Cooperate otherwise.}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_576 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing your payoff in a scenario where you can either cooperate (C) or defect (D), you should employ a strategy that balances exploitation with preservation. Here's the organized approach:

### Approach
1. **Observe Recent Behavior**: Track the cooperation rate of other players over recent rounds to identify patterns.
2. **Exploit When Safe**: If others are mostly cooperating and the current stock level is sufficiently high, defect (D) to gain higher immediate payoffs without risking a rapid resource depletion.
3. **Preserve Resources**: Cooperate (C) when the stock level is low to prevent further depletion and sustain the resource for future rounds.
4. **Final Rounds Optimization**: In the final stages of the game, prioritize defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoffs, as long-term preservation becomes less critical.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(observation, current_step, total_rounds, n_players, capacity):
    # Parameters
    recent_k = 5  # Number of past rounds to consider
    coop_threshold = 0.7  # Minimum cooperation rate to trigger defecting
    s_high = 0.6 * capacity  # Stock level above which defecting is considered safe
    s_low = 0.3 * capacity   # Stock level below which cooperation is enforced
    final_rounds_t = int(0.1 * total_rounds)  # Last 10% of rounds

    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among others
    if len(observation) == 0:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate initially if no history

    k = min(recent_k, len(observation))
    count_coop = sum(1 for hist in observation[-k:] if hist.action == 'C')
    coop_rate = count_coop / (k * (n_players - 1))  # Exclude self

    # Current stock level
    current_stock = capacity  # Assuming observation includes this; adjust accordingly

    # Decision logic
    if current_stock > s_high and coop_rate >= coop_threshold:
        return 'D'
    elif current_stock < s_low:
        return 'C'
    else:
        rounds_left = total_rounds - current_step
        if rounds_left <= final_rounds_t:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Observation and Pattern Recognition**: The strategy begins by observing the recent actions of other players to determine their cooperation rate. This helps identify opportunities for exploitation.
- **Safe Exploitation**: When others are cooperating (above a certain threshold) and the resource level is high, defecting is safe and profitable. This exploits others' willingness to cooperate without causing immediate harm to the resource.
- **Resource Preservation**: Cooperating when the stock is low ensures that the resource isn't depleted too quickly, maintaining it for potential future exploitation opportunities.
- **Final Rounds Optimization**: In the last 10% of rounds, defecting maximizes immediate gains, as long-term considerations become less relevant.

This approach effectively balances short-term gains with sustainable practices, optimizing your payoff while managing the shared resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_577 = '''
To address the problem of developing an exploitative strategy that adapts to others' actions and current resource levels, we propose a decision-making framework. This strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable exploitation by considering both past behavior and the current state of resources.

### Approach
1. **Initial Exploitation**: Start by defecting in the first round to test others' reactions and gain an immediate payoff.
2. **Adaptive Behavior**:
   - Track the proportion of defects in previous rounds to gauge the trend among participants.
   - If most players are defecting, continue defecting to align with the prevalent strategy.
   - Exploit cooperation by defecting when fewer players are doing so, maximizing personal gain while others maintain resource levels.
3. **Resource Conservation**: Switch to cooperation when resources drop below a critical threshold to allow regrowth for future exploitation.

### Solution Code
```python
def decision_rule(round_number, prev_actions, current_stock):
    capacity = 100  # Assuming capacity is known or can be inferred
    defect_threshold_prev = 0.6  # Threshold for previous defects
    stock_low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity  # Stock level below which cooperation is favored
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    else:
        total_defects = sum(prev_actions)
        num_prev_rounds = len(prev_actions) // n  # Assuming each prev_action represents one player's move
        defect_rate = (total_defects / num_prev_rounds) if num_prev_rounds != 0 else 0
        
        if current_stock < stock_low_threshold:
            return 'C'
        elif defect_rate > defect_threshold_prev:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Defection**: The strategy starts with defection to immediately benefit from others' potential cooperation.
- **Adaptive Defection**: By monitoring past actions, the strategy adapts. If most players are defecting, it follows suit to maximize gains in a competitive environment. When fewer defect, it exploits their cooperative behavior.
- **Resource Management**: The strategy switches to cooperation when resources are low, ensuring long-term sustainability for continued exploitation opportunities.

This approach efficiently balances immediate gain with strategic resource management, aligning with an exploitative mindset while adapting dynamically to changing conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_578 = '''
To address the problem of balancing exploitation with conservation in a dynamic environment where other players' strategies are unknown, we can employ an adaptive strategy that adjusts based on the current state and observed behavior of others. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Early Exploration (First 20% Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Reason: Exploit potentially cooperative players while the stock is high, allowing growth despite depletion.

2. **Middle Exploitation and Conservation (Next 60% Rounds):**
   - **Determine Other Players' Behavior:**
     - Calculate the proportion of Cooperators among other players in the previous round.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:**
     - Set a threshold at 60% of capacity (`S_t = 0.6 * capacity`).
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If more than half of others Cooperated last round, Defect to exploit their cooperation.
     - Otherwise, if the current stock is above `S_t`, Defect; else, Cooperate to preserve the stock.

3. **Late Conservation and Final Exploitation (Last 20% Rounds):**
   - **Second-to-Last Round:**
     - Cooperate if the stock is low to allow some growth into the final round.
   - **Final Round:**
     - Defect to maximize immediate gain, as there are no future rounds.

### Detailed Strategy Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set `S_t` to 60% of capacity for stock threshold checks.

2. **For Each Round (Except Last):**
   a. **Calculate Cooperators' Proportion:**
      - Count how many other players Cooperated in the previous round.
      - Calculate the proportion `C_prev = count / (total_players - 1)`.

   b. **Decision Making:**
      i. If `C_prev > 0.5`:
         - **Action:** Defect.
           - Reason: Exploit the majority who Cooperated.
      ii. Else:
          - Check current stock level `S`.
          - If `S >= S_t`:
             - **Action:** Defect.
               - Reason: High stock allows growth after depletion.
          - Else:
             - **Action:** Cooperate.
               - Reason: Preserve the stock for future growth.

3. **Final Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Reason: Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Edge Cases and Adjustments

- **First Round:** Always Defect to test others' reactions.
- **Near Endgame:** In the penultimate round, Cooperate if stock is low to allow minimal growth into the last round before final exploitation.

This strategy dynamically adapts to both other players' behaviors and the current state of the resource, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_579 = '''
To address the problem of sustainably exploiting a shared resource while maintaining its health, we propose an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts behavior based on cooperation levels and resource status. The strategy starts with cooperation to build trust and ensure resource stability, then exploits when conditions allow, reverting to cooperation if overuse is detected.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initialization**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same, ensuring resource health.

2. **Adaptive Defection**: In subsequent rounds:
   - Monitor the previous round's actions: Count how many players Cooperated.
   - Check the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If more than half of players Cooperated and the stock is above 80% of capacity, Defect to exploit while maintaining sustainability.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate to allow resource recovery or sustain it.

3. **Edge Cases**: Near the end of the game (last few rounds), the strategy may shift towards Defection as future consequences diminish, but adaptability ensures it can revert based on current conditions.

**Solution Code:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, n, capacity, stock, prev_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        num_coop_prev = sum(1 for actions in prev_actions.values() if actions[-1] == 'C')
        majority_coop = (num_coop_prev / n) > 0.5
        stock_threshold = capacity * 0.8
        if majority_coop and stock >= stock_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization**: The strategy starts by Cooperating in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.
  
- **Monitoring and Decision Making**: In each subsequent round, it checks two conditions:
  - Whether more than half of players Cooperated in the previous round.
  - If the current stock is above 80% of its capacity.
  
  Based on these checks, it decides whether to Defect (exploit) or Cooperate (sustain).

- **Sustainability and Adaptability**: By only defecting under safe conditions (high cooperation and sufficient stock), the strategy prevents resource depletion while maximizing individual gain. It dynamically adjusts based on others' actions and resource status, ensuring long-term sustainability.

This approach balances exploitation with conservation, promoting a stable and fair use of shared resources.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_580 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reason: Observing others' behavior without risking immediate stock depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step A: Calculate Average Cooperation Rate**
     - Track the number of Cooperations in the last `k` rounds (e.g., k=3).
     - Compute average cooperation rate = total cooperations / (n * k)
   
   - **Step B: Predict Others' Actions**
     - Assume others will maintain their recent cooperation rate.
   
   - **Step C: Simulate Outcomes**
     - If predicted cooperation rate > 60%, simulate both Defecting and Cooperating:
       - Calculate expected payoff for each action.
       - Estimate the resulting stock level after consumption and growth.
   
   - **Step D: Decision Making**
     - Choose to Defect (D) if:
       - Expected payoff from Defecting > Cooperating
       - Simulated new stock ≥ 40% of capacity
     - Else, Cooperate (C)

3. **Near Endgame (Last 1/3 Rounds):**
   - **Adjustment:** Increase the likelihood of defecting by lowering the cooperation threshold to 50%.
   - Focus on maximizing immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If stock is below a critical level (e.g., 20% of capacity), Cooperate to prevent further depletion.
   - In rounds following significant stock drops, prioritize Cooperating to allow recovery.

This strategy balances exploitation with cautious behavior, ensuring maximum payoff while maintaining sustainable stock levels for future rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_581 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Phase:**
   - For the first 2-3 rounds, Cooperate (C) to encourage others to cooperate and gather information about their strategies.

2. **Monitoring Phase:**
   - Track:
     - The proportion of players defecting each round.
     - Trends in stock levels (increasing, decreasing, or stable).

3. **Decision Making:**
   - **If the stock is above 80% of capacity and most players cooperated in recent rounds (>60% cooperation):** Defect (D) to exploit their cooperation.
   - **If the stock is below 50% of capacity or decreasing:** Cooperate (C) to aid in recovery.
   - **Else:** Default to defecting, exploiting when it's safe and beneficial.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Use a threshold-based system where:
     - `recent_coop_rate` is the average cooperation rate over the last 3 rounds.
     - `current_stock` is compared against high (80% capacity) and low (50% capacity) thresholds.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
   - If others defect heavily, switch to cooperation to prevent resource collapse.

6. **Implementation Logic:**
   ```python
   def decide_action(round_data, current_stock):
       if round <= 3:
           return 'C'
       recent_coop = average Cooperation in last 3 rounds
       stock_high = 0.8 * capacity
       stock_low = 0.5 * capacity

       if current_stock > stock_high and recent_coop > 0.6:
           return 'D'  # Exploit when safe
       elif current_stock < stock_low or (current_stock decreasing):
           return 'C'  # Preserve resource
       else:
           return 'D'  # Default to exploit moderately

   record_action(decision)
   ```

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to others' actions and the state of the resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_582 = '''
To determine whether the AI should Cooperate or Defect based on the current stock level relative to capacity, we can use a heuristic approach. The AI should:

1. **Cooperate** if the current stock is below 50% of capacity. This prevents over-depletion and allows for growth.
2. **Defect** otherwise (i.e., when the current stock is above 50% of capacity). This maximizes immediate payoff while maintaining sustainability.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S < \frac{1}{2} C, \text{ Defect otherwise}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_583 = '''
To address the problem of maximizing immediate payoff while ensuring sustainable resource exploitation, we propose a strategy that adapts based on the current stock level and its historical trends. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define `threshold_high` as 75% of the total capacity.
   - Define `threshold_low` as 25% of the total capacity.

2. **First Round Action**:
   - Since the initial stock is at full capacity (high), choose to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   a. **If current stock S > threshold_high (75%)**:
      - Choose to Defect (D). The high stock level allows for higher consumption without risking significant depletion.
   
   b. **Else if current stock S < threshold_low (25%)**:
      - Choose to Cooperate (C). Low stock levels require preservation to allow regrowth and prevent complete resource depletion.

   c. **If current stock is in the moderate range (25% ≤ S ≤ 75%)**:
      i. **Assess Historical Trends**:
         - Calculate the change in stock level from the previous round.
         - If the trend indicates a consistent decrease despite growth, switch to Cooperate (C) to prevent further depletion.
         - If the trend is stable or increasing, continue to Defect (D).

4. **Adaptive Adjustment**:
   - Monitor the stock's behavior over rounds. If defecting leads to a significant drop in stock levels below threshold_low, increase cooperation in subsequent rounds to allow recovery.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, ensuring that resources are preserved when necessary and exploited when safe. It uses thresholds based on relative capacity percentages and historical trends to dynamically adjust actions, providing an effective approach across various scenarios.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is a balanced approach between exploiting resources for maximum immediate gain and conserving them to ensure future exploitation. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **High Stock Levels (Above 75% Capacity)**:
   - **Action**: Defect.
   - **Reasoning**: When resources are abundant, defecting maximizes your immediate payoff without risking long-term sustainability.

2. **Low Stock Levels (Below 25% Capacity)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning**: Low resource levels necessitate conservation to allow regrowth and prevent complete depletion, ensuring future opportunities for exploitation.

3. **Moderate Stock Levels (Between 25% and 75% Capacity)**:
   - **Assess Historical Trends**:
     a. If the stock trend is decreasing despite growth from previous rounds, switch to Cooperate to prevent further depletion.
     b. If the trend is stable or increasing, continue to Defect to maintain immediate gains.

4. **Adaptive Adjustment**:
   - Continuously monitor the stock's behavior. If defecting causes significant drops below 25%, increase cooperation in subsequent rounds to facilitate recovery.

This strategy effectively balances exploitation and conservation, ensuring both immediate gains and long-term resource availability for future exploitation.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal balance between exploiting resources for maximum gain and conserving them for future use is achieved by:

1. Defecting when the stock exceeds 75% of capacity to maximize immediate payoff.
2. Cooperating when the stock falls below 25% to allow regrowth.
3. Assessing trends in moderate levels (25-75%) and adapting actions accordingly, switching to cooperation if the stock shows a decreasing trend.

Thus, the strategy is:

$\boxed{\text{Defect when resources are abundant (>75%), cooperate when scarce (<25%), and adapt based on trends otherwise}}$

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts and thrives against various opponent behaviors, we outline the following approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy balances exploitation with sustainable resource management. It exploits others by defecting when beneficial but cooperates to prevent resource collapse, especially as rounds progress.

---

### Decision Rules:

1. **Early Rounds (First Half):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate if the stock is below 80% of capacity; otherwise, defect.
   - **Rationale:** Start conservatively to avoid early depletion while exploiting when safe.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate if the stock is below 75% or rounds remaining are less than a third; else, defect.
   - **Rationale:** Adjust to sustain resources as depletion risks rise.

3. **Late Rounds (Last Third):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoffs with no future rounds to consider.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Track stock trends and adjust thresholds if the stock decreases despite cooperation, indicating more opponents are defecting.

---

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(history, state):
    capacity = state.capacity
    current_stock = state.stock
    round_number = len(history)
    total_rounds = ...  # Defined based on game parameters
    threshold_cooperate_high = 0.8 * capacity
    threshold_cooperate_low = 0.6 * capacity

    # Early rounds: Cooperate when stock is low; defect otherwise
    if round_number < total_rounds / 2:
        if current_stock > threshold_cooperate_high:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    # Middle rounds: Adjust based on stock and rounds remaining
    elif round_number < (2 * total_rounds) / 3:
        if current_stock < threshold_cooperate_low or len(history) > (2 * total_rounds)/3:
            return 'C'
        else:
            recent_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-5:] if action == 'D')
            if recent_defectors / len(history[-5:]) > 0.6:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
    
    # Late rounds: Always Defect
    else:
        return 'D'

# Adjust thresholds dynamically based on stock trend
def update_thresholds(current_stock, previous_stock):
    global threshold_cooperate_high, threshold_cooperate_low
    if current_stock < previous_stock * 0.95:
        threshold_cooperate_high *= 0.98
        threshold_cooperate_low *= 0.97
    elif current_stock > previous_stock * 1.05:
        threshold_cooperate_high *= 1.02
        threshold_cooperate_low *= 1.03
```

---

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to avoid early depletion.
- **Low Stock:** Switch to Cooperate to prevent collapse, especially with rounds remaining.
- **Final Rounds:** Prioritize Defecting for maximum payoff.

This strategy effectively balances exploitation and sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponent behaviors while ensuring long-term resource viability.

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

   - Additionally, if the current stock is below 50% of capacity and defection rates are high, switch to cooperation to allow recovery.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Defect to test others' responses.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 2 rounds):** Always defect to exploit any remaining stock without concern for future rounds.

3. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - If the stock has been decreasing over the last two rounds, increase cooperation in subsequent rounds to prevent further depletion.
   - If the stock is stable or increasing, continue exploiting by defecting when beneficial.

This strategy balances exploitation with adaptive cooperation, ensuring maximum payoff while preventing complete resource collapse. It dynamically adjusts based on recent observations of opponents' actions and current stock levels, making it robust against various behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_586 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on exploiting opponents' behaviors while ensuring sustainable exploitation of the resource. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Cooperation (First 3 Rounds):**
   - Start with Cooperate to build trust and assess opponents' strategies without immediately depleting resources.

2. **Assess Opponents' Behavior:**
   - After each round, calculate the proportion of Cooperators among opponents.
   - Use a weighted average (e.g., 70% current round, 30% previous) to adapt dynamically.

3. **Stock Health Monitoring:**
   - Evaluate if the stock is too low (below threshold). If so, switch to Cooperate to allow regrowth.
   - If stock is near capacity, defecting is safe but watch for over-depletion by others.

4. **Decision Rules Based on Cooperation Rate:**
   - If opponents' cooperation rate > 70%, Defect to exploit their willingness to share.
   - If cooperation rate < 30%, Cooperate to prevent resource collapse and encourage future sustainability.

5. **Handling Last Few Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - Shift towards defecting more to maximize immediate payoffs, as long-term consequences are minimal.

### Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **Stock Near Zero/Capacity:**
   - Near zero: Cooperate to avoid collapse.
   - Near capacity: Defect if safe; else, Cooperate to sustain growth.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, opponent_actions_history, cooperation_rates):
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'
    
    current_coop_rate = calculate_current_cooperation(opponent_actions_history)
    weighted_avg = (0.7 * current_coop_rate) + (0.3 * previous_avg)
    
    if stock_level < 20:  # Arbitrary threshold for low stock
        return 'C'
    elif stock_level > capacity - 10:
        return 'D' if weighted_avg > 0.6 else 'C'
    else:
        if weighted_avg > 0.7:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def calculate_current_cooperation(opponent_actions):
    coop_count = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions if action == 'C')
    return coop_count / len(opponent_actions)
```

### Exploitative Mindset

- **Exploit Cooperators:** When many opponents Cooperate, defect to gain more while they sustain the resource.
- **Prevent Collapse:** If too many Defect, Cooperate to preserve the resource for future gains.

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponent behaviors and stock health.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_587 = '''
To address the problem, we'll outline a strategy where each player decides to either defect or cooperate based on the current stock level. The goal is to maximize individual payoff while considering the impact on future rounds.

### Approach
The strategy proposed is straightforward:
1. **Defect** when the current stock (S) is greater than half of the maximum capacity.
2. **Cooperate** otherwise.

This approach balances immediate gains from defecting with the need to maintain a sustainable stock level for future rounds. By setting the threshold at half capacity, we ensure that there's enough room for growth without risking severe depletion.

### Solution Code
```python
def decision(stock, max_stock):
    # Cooperate if current stock is less than or equal to half of maximum capacity
    return 'Cooperate' if stock <= max_stock / 2 else 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
- **Defect (Exploit)**: When the stock is above half of its maximum capacity, defecting provides a higher immediate payoff. The growth term in subsequent rounds can still sustain or increase the stock due to the remaining capacity.
- **Cooperate (Preserve)**: When the stock drops below half capacity, cooperation helps prevent further depletion and allows the stock to recover through growth.

This strategy ensures that each player maximizes their immediate gains while maintaining a sustainable level of resources for future rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_588 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy in a repeated game with dynamic state changes, we can employ a threshold-based approach that adapts to the current state (stock level) and past behavior inferred from stock changes. The strategy balances immediate payoff maximization with considerations for long-term sustainability by switching between defecting and cooperating based on specific conditions.

### Approach

1. **Initial Round Exploitation**: Start by defecting in the first round to exploit others' potential cooperation, as the initial stock is at its maximum capacity.
2. **Defect When Stock is Healthy**: In subsequent rounds, defect if the current stock is above a threshold (e.g., half of the capacity). This allows for exploiting others while the resource is still abundant.
3. **Cooperate on Significant Depletion**: If the stock shows significant depletion from one round to another (indicating high defection rates), switch to cooperating to prevent further collapse and allow potential recovery.
4. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjust the strategy dynamically based on observed changes in the stock level, which provides feedback about others' behavior.

### Solution Code

```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_stock = None
        self.capacity = 100  # Assuming capacity is 100; adjust as necessary
        self.threshold = self.capacity / 2
        self.depletion_threshold = 0.9

    def action(self, current_round, total_rounds, current_stock):
        if current_round == 1:
            # First round: defect to exploit others' potential cooperation
            return "defect"
        else:
            # Check for significant depletion from previous round
            if self.previous_stock is not None and current_stock < self.depletion_threshold * self.previous_stock:
                return "cooperate"
            
            # Defect if stock is above threshold, else cooperate
            if current_stock > self.threshold:
                return "defect"
            else:
                return "cooperate"

    def update_state(self, current_stock):
        self.previous_stock = current_stock

# Example usage:
strategy = Strategy()
current_round = 1
total_rounds = 5
stock_history = [100, 80, 60, 40, 30]

for i in range(total_rounds):
    current_stock = stock_history[i]
    action = strategy.action(i+1, total_rounds, current_stock)
    print(f"Round {i+1}: Action = {action}, Stock = {current_stock}")
    strategy.update_state(current_stock)
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Round Exploitation**: The strategy begins by defecting in the first round to capitalize on others' cooperation when the stock is at its maximum.
- **Defect When Healthy**: By defecting when the stock exceeds half of its capacity, the strategy maximizes immediate gains while the resource remains abundant.
- **Cooperate on Depletion**: Significant drops in stock level signal high defection rates. The strategy switches to cooperating to prevent further depletion and allow potential recovery.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: The strategy adapts by monitoring stock levels and adjusting actions based on observed changes, balancing exploitation with long-term sustainability.

This approach ensures that the strategy effectively exploits others' behavior while maintaining a balance to preserve resources for future rounds.

   - If S between 50-80% and Defectors ≈ 50%: Cooperate (C).
   - If S < 50%: Always Cooperate (C) to prevent collapse.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def EAS_strategy(current_round, total_rounds, stock, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = get_capacity()
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'D'
    
    if current_round > (3/4) * total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate safe thresholds
    safe_high = 0.8 * capacity
    safe_mid = 0.5 * capacity
    
    # Count defectors in previous round
    prev_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'D')
    
    # Check stock level and defector trend
    if stock > safe_high:
        return 'D'
    elif stock < safe_mid:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if prev_defectors / n < 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### **Handling Edge Cases:**

- **Initial Stock Near Capacity:** Exploit by defecting early to gain higher payoffs while the stock is robust.
- **Stock Depletion:** If S drops below safe levels, switch to cooperation to prevent further collapse and allow recovery.
- **Sudden Defector Surge:** If a majority start defecting, cooperate to mitigate rapid depletion.

---

### **Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

EAS prioritizes immediate gains by defecting when others cooperate. It adapts by cooperating when necessary to preserve the stock, ensuring sustainability for continued exploitation. The strategy dynamically adjusts based on current conditions and opponent behaviors without relying on mutual cooperation or predetermined patterns.

This approach aims to maximize individual payoffs while strategically preserving resources to maintain exploitative opportunities throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_590 = '''
To effectively manage the exploitation and sustainability of the common resource, follow this strategic approach:

1. **Early/Middle Game Strategy (First 2/3 Rounds):**
   - **Defect** if the current stock level exceeds 75% of the capacity. This allows you to capitalize on higher immediate gains while the resource is abundant.
   - **Cooperate** when the stock falls below this threshold. This promotes resource recovery, ensuring sustainable future exploitation.

2. **Late Game Strategy (Last 1/3 Rounds):**
   - Always **Defect** to maximize your immediate payoff. With fewer rounds remaining, the focus shifts from sustainability to maximizing gains.

By balancing defecting and Cooperating based on stock levels and game progression, you optimize both short-term gains and long-term resource management, leading to a higher overall payoff. 

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Defect when stock > 75% capacity in early rounds; always Defect in late rounds}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_591 = '''
To maximize your own payoff in each round by exploiting others' potential cooperation, you should always choose to Defect. This strategy allows you to take advantage of the higher immediate payoff from defecting while disregarding the impact on future rounds.

**Answer:**

\boxed{D}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_592 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Defect. This maximizes immediate payoff and sets a tone of exploitativeness.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **Track Opponents' Behavior:**
      - Calculate the cooperation rate of opponents each round.
      - Use a moving average to smooth out short-term fluctuations.

   b. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
      - Define thresholds relative to capacity (e.g., high = 60%, medium = 30%).
      - Adjust actions based on stock level and opponents' behavior.

   c. **Decision Rules:**
      - If cooperation rate > 50% and stock is above medium, defect to exploit.
      - If cooperation rate < 30% or stock is low, consider cooperating to allow growth for future exploitation.
      - If stock is near capacity, defect to maximize immediate gain.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - Always defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

4. **Stock Dynamics Consideration:**
   - Monitor stock trends (increasing/decreasing).
   - Adjust strategy to manipulate stock near optimal growth points for future rounds, while exploiting opponents' strategies.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
Initialize:
    last_rounds = 0.1 * r
    thresholds = {high: 0.6*capacity, medium: 0.3*capacity}

For each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = D
    else:
        cooperation_rate = average of opponents' C actions over past rounds
        stock_level = current stock

        if cooperation_rate > 50% and stock_level > thresholds['medium']:
            action = D
        elif cooperation_rate < 30% or stock_level < thresholds['medium']:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D if stock_level > thresholds['high'] else C

    if t >= r - last_rounds:
        action = D

    execute action
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with strategic manipulation of the stock, exploiting opponents' behaviors while adapting to maintain exploitativeness throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_593 = '''
The AI employs a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term resource preservation. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round:** Always Defect to exploit potential cooperative tendencies among players.
2. **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize payoff, as there are no future rounds to consider.
3. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Check if the current stock is above a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity).
   - Determine if other players' recent actions indicate a high proportion of Cooperate moves (e.g., >50%).
   - If both conditions are met, Defect to exploit others' cooperation.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate to help preserve the resource for future exploitation.

### Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Exploit by defecting due to no prior information and high initial stock.
- **Last Round:** Maximize payoff by defecting without concern for future rounds.
- **Mid Rounds:** Balance exploiting cooperation with preserving resources when necessary.

This strategy effectively exploits cooperative behavior while ensuring resource sustainability for continued exploitation in subsequent rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_594 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to defect or cooperate based on the current stock level and preventing over-depletion, we propose the following strategy:

1. **Threshold-Based Decision**: The AI will decide to Defect if the current stock is above 70% of capacity. Otherwise, it will Cooperate.
2. **Rationale**:
   - **Defecting When Stock is High**: By defecting when the stock is above 70%, the AI maximizes its immediate payoff while ensuring there's enough resource left for growth in subsequent rounds.
   - **Cooperating at Lower Levels**: Switching to cooperation prevents over-depletion, allowing the stock to recover and sustain future growth.

This strategy balances exploitation of high stock levels with preservation of resources for sustainability. 

**Answer**: The AI will defect if the current stock is above 70% of capacity; otherwise, it will cooperate. Thus, the decision is \boxed{D} when the stock exceeds this threshold and \boxed{C} otherwise.

---

### Example Calculation:

Suppose the game has a capacity of 100 units and there are 4 players (n=4).

- **Current Stock**: 85 units.
- Since 85 > 70, the AI decides to Defect (D).
  
If all other players cooperate:
- Each cooperating player consumes 12.5 units (since each C gives S/n = 85/4 ≈ 21.25? Wait, actually, in the example when n=4 and capacity is 100 with all C, each gets 12.5. So perhaps my earlier reasoning was incorrect.

Wait, let me clarify:

In the given example:
- When all players Cooperate (C), each player's payoff is S/n = 100/4 = 25. But in the detailed breakdown, it was mentioned that each C gives 12.5. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me correct:

In the example where n=4 and all Cooperate:
- Each gets S/(n) = 100 / 4 = 25.
- Total consumption: 4 * 25 = 100? But that would leave stock at 0, but in the example, it was stated as total consumption of 50, leaving 50 for growth.

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me double-check:

In the problem statement example:
- When all players Cooperate (C), each player's payoff is 12.5.
- Total consumption: 4 * 12.5 = 50 units.
- Stock after consumption: 100 - 50 = 50 units.
- Growth: 2 * 50 * (1 - 50/100) = 2*50*0.5 = 50, so new stock is min(50+50, 100)=100.

Ah, I see. So in the example, when all Cooperate, each C gives 12.5 because S/n might have been miscalculated earlier.

Wait, no: if each player's payoff is 12.5 when all Cooperate, then total consumption is 4 * 12.5 = 50, leaving 50 for growth. So the stock remains at 100 after growth.

But in another scenario where one defects while others cooperate:
- Defector gets S/n_defectors, which might be different. Wait, perhaps each defector consumes more than cooperators?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify how consumption is calculated when some defect and others cooperate.

In the example provided:
- When all Cooperate: Each C gives 12.5, total consumption 50, stock remains at 50 after consumption but then grows back to 100.
- When one defects (D) while others Cooperate: The defector gets S/(n_defectors). Wait, perhaps the calculation is that each D consumes twice as much?

Wait, let me check:

In the example where n=4 and all C:
- Each player's payoff is 12.5.
- Total consumption = 4 * 12.5 = 50.
- Stock after consumption: 100 - 50 = 50.
- Growth: 2*50*(1 - 50/100) = 50, so new stock is 50 + 50 = 100.

In the case where one defects (D) and others Cooperate:
- Suppose I defect while others cooperate. How much do I consume?

Assuming that when you Defect, your consumption is S/n_defectors, but in this case, only one defector exists.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each D consumes 25 units (as per the original example where all D leads to total consumption of 100, as each D would consume 25).

But wait, in the problem statement, when all players Cooperate:
- Each player gets 12.5.
- Total consumption is 4 * 12.5 = 50.

When one defects and others cooperate:
- The defector consumes more than a cooperator.

Wait, actually, perhaps each D gives a higher payoff because the defector doesn't share the resource as much.

In game theory terms, when you defect in the Prisoner's Dilemma, you get a higher immediate payoff but risk lower future payoffs if others retaliate.

But given the problem involves resource consumption and growth, I need to model it accurately.

Given that all Cooperate results in each getting 12.5, total consumption of 50, leaving 50 for growth which brings stock back to 100.

If one defects while others cooperate:
- Suppose Defecting gives me a higher payoff. Let's say I get S/(n_defectors), but n_defectors=1 in this case.
- So if I defect alone, my payoff would be 100/1 = 100? That doesn't make sense because the total consumption can't exceed 100.

Wait, perhaps each player's action determines their share. If you Cooperate, your share is S/n_players; if you Defect, you take more, say S/(n_defectors).

But this needs clarification. Perhaps a better way is:

- When you Cooperate, you contribute to sustainable consumption.
- When you Defect, you take as much as possible without regard for others.

Alternatively, perhaps the payoffs are structured such that Cooperating gives each player an equal share of S/n, while Defecting gives a higher individual payoff but leads to more total consumption.

Given the problem statement's example:
- All C: Each gets 12.5.
- So total consumption is 4*12.5 = 50.

If one D and others C:
- Let me assume that the defector takes twice as much, so 25, while each cooperator takes 12.5.
- Total consumption: 25 + 3*12.5 = 25 + 37.5 = 62.5
- Stock after consumption: 100 - 62.5 = 37.5
- Growth: 2 * 37.5 * (1 - 37.5/100) ≈ 46.875
- New stock: min(37.5 + 46.875, 100) = 84.375

So next round starts with a lower stock but not critically low.

Given this, the strategy of defecting when above 70% (which is 70 units in a capacity of 100) makes sense to maximize immediate payoff while leaving enough for growth.

**Final Answer**: The AI will Defect if the current stock exceeds 70% of capacity; otherwise, it will Cooperate. Thus, the decision is \boxed{D} when the stock is above this threshold and \boxed{C} otherwise.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_595 = '''
The designed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is an adaptive and exploitative approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by considering both the current stock level and opponents' behavior. Here's the organized strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Exploitative Adaptive Strategy (EAS)

1. **Initial Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Purpose: Gain immediate payoff while testing opponents' reactions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**

   a. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
      - If the stock is above 80% of capacity:
        - **Action:** Cooperate.
          - Reason: Maintain high stock levels to ensure future exploitation opportunities.
      - If the stock is below 20% of capacity:
        - **Action:** Cooperate.
          - Reason: Prevent further depletion and allow regrowth.
      - If the stock is between 20% and 80%:
        - Proceed to evaluate opponents' behavior.

   b. **Opponents' Behavior Analysis:**
      - Calculate each opponent's Defection Rate (DR) over past rounds.
      - If the average DR across all opponents exceeds 70%:
        - **Action:** Cooperate.
          - Reason: Prevent stock crash by maintaining it for future exploitation.
      - If the average DR is below 70%:
        - **Action:** Defect.
          - Reason: Exploit opponents who are more cooperative.

3. **Retaliation Mechanism:**
   - Track individual opponents' DR.
   - If an opponent's DR exceeds a threshold (e.g., 85%), retaliate by defecting against them to mitigate losses.

4. **Final Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Reason: Maximize immediate payoff with no future rounds to consider.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Default to Defect to test opponents and gain initial payoffs.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect to exploit any remaining stock without concern for sustainability.
- **Stock Near Capacity or Zero:** Cooperate to maintain or regenerate the stock, ensuring long-term exploitation potential.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def EAS_strategy(opponent_actions_history):
    round_number = len(opponent_actions_history) + 1
    n = number_of_players()
    
    # Initial Round Handling
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate Defection Rates
    dr_per_opponent = calculate_defection_rates(opponent_actions_history)
    average_dr = sum(dr_per_opponent.values()) / len(dr_per_opponent)
    
    # Stock Level Check
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    capacity = get_capacity()
    
    if current_stock >= 0.8 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock <= 0.2 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Evaluate based on opponents' behavior and stock dynamics
        if average_dr > 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
# Helper Functions (as needed)
def calculate_defection_rates(opponent_actions):
    dr = {}
    for i, actions in opponent_actions.items():
        total = len(actions)
        defections = sum(1 for a in actions if a == 'D')
        dr[i] = defections / total
    return dr

def get_current_stock():
    # Implementation to fetch current stock level
    pass

def get_capacity():
    # Implementation to fetch capacity parameter
    pass
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy effectively balances exploitation with sustainability by adapting to opponents' behaviors and stock dynamics. It ensures high immediate payoffs while maintaining resources for continued exploitation across multiple rounds, making it robust against various opponent strategies in the tournament setting.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_596 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Justification: Maximize immediate payoff with no historical context, leveraging others' potential cooperation.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:**
     - If current stock > 75% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect
         - Exploit others' cooperation by taking more while the resource is abundant.
     - If current stock ≤ 75% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
         - Prevent further depletion and sustain future payoffs.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - No future rounds to consider, so maximize immediate payoff.

4. **Adaptive Adjustments:**
   - Monitor stock levels after each round.
   - If defecting leads to significant stock drops:
     - Shift towards cooperation in subsequent rounds to sustain the resource for longer-term gains.

**Rationale:**

- **Exploitation:** Leverage others' cooperative tendencies by defecting when possible, especially in early and late stages where immediate gains are prioritized.
- **Sustainability:** Cooperate when the stock is low to avoid rapid depletion, ensuring continued playability and higher payoffs over time.
- **Adaptability:** Adjust based on observed outcomes to balance exploitation with sustainability, preventing a "tragedy of the commons" while still pursuing maximum personal gain.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_597 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (Exploration Phase):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Exploit the initial high stock by defecting to gain higher immediate payoffs while the resource is abundant.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation:**
   - **Stock Threshold:** Monitor if the current stock falls below 70% of capacity.
     - If above, continue defecting.
     - If below, switch to Cooperate (C) to preserve the remaining stock and allow regrowth.
   - **Opponent Behavior:** Track the number of players defecting in previous rounds.

3. **Final Rounds (Exploitation Phase):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Prioritize maximizing immediate payoffs in the last few rounds since future payoffs are irrelevant after the game ends.

**Summary:**

- **Early Game:** Exploit by defecting when stock is high.
- **Mid-Game:** Adapt based on stock health and opponent behavior. Cooperate if stock drops below 70% or if over half of players are defecting.
- **Late Game:** Return to defecting in the final rounds to maximize payoffs.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by adapting to opponents' behaviors while considering stock sustainability. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. Early Rounds: Observational Phase
- **First 2-3 Rounds:** Cooperate (C) to observe the game dynamics and encourage others to Cooperate, which may lead to higher total payoffs if everyone follows.

### 2. Mid Game: Exploit Cooperation
- **From Round 4 onwards:** Monitor opponents' behavior through total consumption.
  - Calculate the average total consumption over the last m rounds (e.g., m=5).
  - If this average is below a threshold (indicative of more Cooperates), Defect (D) to exploit others' cooperation.
  - If the average is high, switch to Cooperate to prevent stock collapse and allow recovery.

### 3. Threshold Strategy
- **Threshold Calculation:** Set a threshold based on capacity and game dynamics. For example, if the current stock is above 50% of capacity, Defect; else, Cooperate.
- Adjust this threshold dynamically based on past consumption rates and remaining rounds.

### 4. Late Game: Maximize Immediate Payoffs
- **Last 10% Rounds:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs without worrying about future sustainability.

### 5. Dynamic Adjustment
- Continuously adapt based on recent total consumption:
  - Low consumption suggests others Cooperate; exploit by Defecting.
  - High consumption indicates many Defectors; switch to Cooperate to prevent stock depletion.

### Decision Rules Pseudocode

```
function decide_action(round_number, remaining_rounds, current_stock, past_consumptions):
    if round_number <= 3:

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_599 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoff by exploiting opponents while maintaining resource sustainability for future gains.

---

### **Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Start with **Cooperate (C)** in the first round to encourage a higher stock level and set a cooperative baseline.
   - Monitor opponents' actions closely; if many defect, adjust strategy in subsequent rounds.

2. **Opponents' Behavior Tracking:**
   - Maintain a record of each opponent's past actions (C/D) across rounds.
   - Calculate the defection rate among opponents. If the majority defects, consider switching to Defect (D).

3. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - Cooperate if the stock level is above a threshold (e.g., capacity/2), as it indicates sustainability.
   - Switch to Defecting if the stock is below this threshold and opponents are defecting, exploiting while preserving enough resource for future rounds.

4. **Adaptation Based on Growth:**
   - If stock growth is high following cooperation, continue Cooperating.
   - If growth is low or negative after Defecting, reduce defection to prevent over-depletion.

5. **Exploitation Opportunities:**
   - Exploit when opponents Cooperate but others defect; maximize personal gain by defecting while maintaining resource balance.

---

### **Handling Edge Cases**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and observe opponents' initial moves.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Defect without hesitation, as there are no future rounds to consider. Maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Low Stock Levels:**
   - If stock is critically low (e.g., below n), prioritize Cooperating to prevent crash.
   - Balance between exploiting and preserving the resource for potential future rounds.

---

### **Exploitative Mindset Alignment**

- Focus on maximizing personal payoff by defecting when opponents cooperate, while monitoring stock health to ensure long-term gains.
- Adapt dynamically based on observed behavior and resource state to exploit opportunities effectively without causing irreversible resource depletion.

---

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
Initialize history for each player as empty

for each round in 1..r:
    if first round:
        action = C
    else:
        opponents_defection_rate = calculate_defection_rate(history)
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        
        if opponents_defection_rate > threshold and current_stock > capacity/2:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C
            
    observe all players' actions, update history
```

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to exploit opponents while preserving the resource for continued gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_600 = '''
**Final Answer:**

To address the problem, we've developed a strategic approach that balances exploitation with sustainability. The strategy involves defecting early when the stock is high and others might be cooperating, monitoring cooperation rates to decide subsequent actions, and defecting more in later rounds when future impact is minimal.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Early Rounds (First 20% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Exploit the initial cooperative tendencies for higher immediate payoffs.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   a. Calculate the average cooperation rate among other players over the past few rounds (e.g., last 5).
   b. If the cooperation rate is above a threshold (e.g., 60%):
      - **Action:** Defect.
      - **Rationale:** Exploit others' cooperation for higher payoffs.
   c. Else:
      - **Action:** Cooperate.
      - **Rationale:** Prevent over-depletion and maintain stock levels for future exploitation.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate gains as future impact is minimal due to limited remaining rounds.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   a. **First Round:**
      - **Action:** Defect.
      - **Rationale:** No history to base decisions on, so prioritize maximum initial payoff.
   b. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10%):**
      - **Action:** Defect.
      - **Rationale:** Future impact is negligible; focus on immediate gains.
   c. **Low Stock Levels (e.g., below 30% of capacity):**
      - **Action:** Cooperate.
      - **Rationale:** Prevent further depletion and allow potential recovery.

### Conclusion:

This strategy effectively balances exploiting others when feasible with maintaining the resource for sustainable exploitation, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term viability.
