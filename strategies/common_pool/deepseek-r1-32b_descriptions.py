**Final Strategy Design for N-Player Public Goods Game**

The proposed strategy is designed to adaptively balance cooperation and defection based on the observed behavior of other players, ensuring robust performance across a wide range of opponent behaviors. Here's the structured approach:

---

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**

**Initialization (Round 1):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - Purpose: Signal willingness to contribute and encourage others to cooperate.

**Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
- Calculate the average cooperation rate among all players over the last M rounds (e.g., M = 5).
- If the average cooperation rate is above a predefined threshold T:
  - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- Else:
  - **Action:** Defect (D)

**Final Round (Round r):**
- **Action:** Defect (D)
  - Reasoning: No future rounds for punishment, so maximize immediate payoff.

---

### **2. Parameters and Thresholds**

- **Threshold (T):** Set initially at 50%. This threshold can be adjusted dynamically based on observed payoffs:
  - If cooperating yields higher payoffs over time, increase T to encourage more cooperation.
  - If defecting proves more beneficial, decrease T.

- **Memory Window (M):** Use the last 5 rounds to calculate the average cooperation rate. This balance between responsiveness and stability allows quick adaptation without excessive volatility.

---

### **3. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Cooperation is chosen to foster a cooperative environment.
- **Last Round:** Defection ensures maximum immediate payoff, acknowledging no future rounds for punishment or reputation building.
- **Transition Periods:** If cooperation rates oscillate, the strategy adapts by switching actions based on recent history, allowing potential recovery from defection spirals.

---

### **4. Robustness and Adaptability**

The strategy is robust because it:
- Does not rely on specific opponent strategies, making it versatile against diverse behaviors.
- Adjusts dynamically using a threshold that can be fine-tuned based on observed outcomes.
- Balances exploration (initial cooperation) with exploitation (adapting to others' actions).

---

### **5. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(round_history, current_round, total_rounds):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round < total_rounds:
        # Calculate average cooperation rate over last M rounds (e.g., 5)
        M = min(5, len(round_history))
        recent_contributions = sum([round['cooperators'] for round in round_history[-M:]])
        avg_coop = recent_contributions / (M * n)  # Assuming n players
        if avg_coop > T:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Last round
        return 'D'
```

---

This strategy effectively navigates the complexities of repeated public goods games, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to maximize individual payoffs while adapting to changing dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_1 = '''
The strategy involves initially cooperating to encourage others to contribute, then exploiting periods of high cooperation by defecting. Here's a clear outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase**: Cooperate for the first 3 rounds to build a cooperative environment.

2. **Dynamic Exploitation and Contribution**:
   - From round 4 onwards, evaluate the average number of cooperators in the last 3 rounds.
   - If more than 50% of players cooperated on average, defect this round to exploit their contributions.
   - If cooperation is below 50%, cooperate to help rebuild the public good for future exploitation.

This approach balances exploiting others' cooperation and contributing when necessary to maintain a beneficial environment.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_2 = '''
**Strategy Description: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation**

The strategy begins with cooperation in the first round to encourage sustainability. It dynamically adjusts based on the current stock level and recent trends, switching to defection when necessary to prevent over-depletion. The threshold for cooperation is adjusted according to stock changes, ensuring adaptability to varying player behaviors.

---

**Decision Rules:**
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - If the current stock exceeds a dynamic threshold `T` and shows stability or growth, Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate gain, signaling potential resource scarcity.
3. **Final Round (Round r):** Always Defect to exploit remaining resources without future concerns.

---

**Threshold Adjustment:**
- After each round:
  - If the stock increased despite cooperation, raise `T` slightly.
  - If the stock decreased while defecting, lower `T` significantly to prompt more cautious behavior in future rounds.

---

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Ensures a cooperative start.
- **Last Round:** Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for sustainability.
- **Threshold Bounds:** Prevents `T` from exceeding capacity or dropping below zero, maintaining realistic adjustments.

---

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def adaptive_threshold_cooperation(n, r, capacity):
    T = 0.8 * capacity
    k = 3  # Window size for trend analysis
    last_stock_values = []
    
    for t in range(1, r+1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            current_stock = stock(t-1)
            last_stock_values.append(current_stock)
            
            if len(last_stock_values) > k:
                last_stock_values.pop(0)
                
            average_stock = sum(last_stock_values) / len(last_stock_values)
            
            trend = 0
            if len(last_stock_values) >= 2:
                trend = current_stock - last_stock_values[-2]
            
            if current_stock > T and trend >= 0:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'
        
        # Handle Last Round
        if t == r:
            action = 'D'
        
        # Adjust Threshold
        prev_action = action if t !=1 else 'C'  # For first round, action is C
        
        if prev_action == 'C':
            if current_stock < T:
                T *= 0.95  # Lower threshold slightly
                T = max(T, 0)
        elif prev_action == 'D':
            if current_stock > T:
                T *= 1.05  # Raise threshold slightly
                T = min(T, capacity)
        
        record_action(action)

    return

# Note: This pseudocode assumes a function `stock(t)` that returns the stock level at round t.
```

**Conclusion:**
This strategy balances cooperation and defection based on dynamic thresholds and recent trends, promoting sustainability while adapting to resource scarcity or exploitative behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_3 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for harvesting a shared resource among players over multiple rounds, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with defection based on current stock levels and previous player behavior. This strategy aims to maintain a sustainable resource level while protecting against exploitation.

**Answer:**

The proposed strategy involves:

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to build trust and sustain high stock levels.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels and Behavior:** In subsequent rounds, assess the current stock as a percentage of capacity and note how many players defected in previous rounds.
3. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - If the stock is above an upper threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) and defection rates are low, continue cooperating to allow maximum resource growth.
   - If the stock drops below a lower threshold (e.g., 50%) or if a significant number of players defect, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains and prevent further resource depletion.
4. **Time-Dependent Adjustment:** As the game progresses towards its end, increase the tendency to defect, reflecting the reduced impact of future rounds on total payoff.

**Edge Cases:**
- In the first round, cooperate without prior information.
- For the last few rounds (e.g., final 10%), prioritize defecting to capitalize on remaining resources.
- If the stock is critically low at any point, defect immediately to maximize limited gains.

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset where cooperation sustains higher payoffs for all, while defection protects against exploitation when others deviate. By dynamically adjusting behavior based on current conditions and future expectations, players can optimize their total payoff over the game's duration.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Adaptive Strategy}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_4 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining sustainable resource use while adapting to others' actions and nearing the end of rounds, a balanced strategy is proposed. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Each player starts by cooperating in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.
   - Parameters are set:
     - `window_size` (m): Number of recent rounds considered, e.g., min(r, 10).
     - `cooperation_threshold_start` (p_start): Initial threshold for cooperation, e.g., 70%.
     - `cooperation_threshold_end` (p_end): Threshold near the end, e.g., 50%.
     - `stock_threshold` (S_thresh): Stock level below which defection is favored, e.g., 60% of capacity.

2. **Each Round t:**
   a. **First Round (t = 1):** Cooperate to establish cooperation.
   b. **Last Round (t = r):** Defect to maximize payoff as there's no future impact.
   c. **Other Rounds (t ≠ 1 and t ≠ r):**
      i. **Analyze Recent Behavior:** Examine the past `window_size` rounds (or all if fewer) to count other players' Cooperations (`C_count`) divided by total possible actions to find the cooperation rate.
      ii. **Adjust Threshold Dynamically:** Calculate the current threshold `p(t)` which decreases linearly from `p_start` to `p_end` as rounds progress.
      iii. **Check Stock Level:** Determine if the current stock `S` is above or below `S_thresh`.
      iv. **Decision Making:**
          - Cooperate if cooperation rate > `p(t)` and `S >= S_thresh`.
          - Otherwise, defect.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If cooperation collapses early, players adapt by defecting more.
   - Maintain flexibility to adjust thresholds for different scenarios (e.g., varying n or r).

**Answer:**

The strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection based on others' actions and resource levels:

- Cooperate initially to encourage sustainability.
- Monitor recent cooperation rates among others and the current stock level.
- Use a dynamic threshold that decreases as rounds progress towards the end, encouraging defection in later stages.
- Defect if cooperation is low or resources are critically depleted.

This approach ensures adaptability while aiming for long-term resource preservation.

\boxed{\text{Adaptive Cooperation Strategy}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_5 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a multi-player game, we propose a dynamic strategy that adapts based on current stock levels and observed cooperation trends among players. The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoffs while considering the collective impact on resource preservation.

### Approach
The approach involves three primary phases, each with specific decision rules tailored to different stages of the game:

1. **Early Rounds**: Focus on maximizing immediate gains by defecting when the stock is high. Transition to cooperation if the stock drops significantly or if a majority of players cooperate.
2. **Mid Rounds**: Adjust strategies based on observed trends in cooperation and resource levels. Cooperate if the stock indicates potential stress and others are sustaining cooperative efforts.
3. **Late Rounds**: Prioritize immediate payoffs by defecting, as there is no future benefit to preserving the resource.

The strategy dynamically adjusts thresholds for cooperation or defection based on the current stock level and the observed behavior of other players. This adaptability ensures that the strategy remains effective even as the game progresses and conditions change.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, previous_cooperation):
    threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.6 * capacity

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'D'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'

    # Early rounds: prioritize defecting when stock is high
    if round_number < total_rounds / 2:
        if current_stock > threshold_high:
            return 'D'
        else:
            if previous_cooperation >= 0.5:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

    # Mid rounds: adjust based on cooperation trends and stock
    else:
        if current_stock < threshold_low:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock > threshold_high * (1 - round_number / total_rounds):
            if previous_cooperation >= 0.6:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            if previous_cooperation >= 0.7:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

    # Default to cooperate if none of the above
    return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The thresholds for high and low stock levels are set as percentages of the total capacity.
- **Early Rounds (First Half)**: Players defect when the stock is high to maximize immediate gains. They switch to cooperation if the stock drops below a threshold or if a majority of players have been cooperating in previous rounds.
- **Mid Rounds**: Players monitor both the stock level and the cooperation trends. Cooperation is encouraged if the stock is low or if a significant proportion of other players are cooperating, indicating sustainable practices.
- **Late Rounds (Last Few)**: Defection is prioritized to maximize immediate payoffs since there's no future benefit in preserving the resource.

This approach ensures that each player dynamically adjusts their strategy based on current conditions and observed behaviors, balancing between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_6 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for players in a game involving resource consumption and growth, we can outline a strategic approach that balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the proposed strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase**: 
   - In the first few rounds, all players should cooperate (choose C). This helps maintain or build up the stock level to a healthy threshold, ensuring that the resource can sustain future consumption.

2. **Threshold-Based Defection**:
   - Define two thresholds relative to the total capacity of the resource: a High Threshold (HT) and a Low Threshold (LT).
     - HT could be set at 80% of capacity.
     - LT could be set at 40% of capacity.
   - If the current stock level exceeds HT and has been increasing or stable over recent rounds, players should defect (choose D). This is because the resource is abundant enough to handle higher consumption without depleting significantly.
   - Conversely, if the stock falls below LT, immediate cooperation is necessary to prevent further depletion and allow for potential regrowth.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment Based on Trend**:
   - Calculate the trend of the stock level over the past few rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
     - If the trend indicates an increasing stock, it's safer to defect as the resource is replenishing.
     - If the trend shows a decreasing stock, cooperation becomes essential to conserve resources and encourage regrowth.

4. **Later Rounds Adjustment**:
   - As the game progresses towards its final stages (e.g., last 20% of rounds), players should gradually shift towards defection. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs in the remaining rounds, knowing that there are fewer future consequences for over-consumption.

5. **Feedback and Adaptation**:
   - After each round, assess whether total consumption was sustainable (i.e., growth >= total consumption).
     - If sustainability is confirmed, allow a bit more leniency towards defection in subsequent rounds.
     - If there's a net decrease in the stock, become more cautious by favoring cooperation to prevent further depletion.

6. **Collaborative Strategy Anticipation**:
   - Since all players are using the same strategy, their collective actions can be predicted. This predictability allows for smoother transitions between cooperation and defection phases without unexpected volatility in resource consumption.

By following this structured approach, players can maximize their individual gains while maintaining the health of the shared resource over time. The strategy balances immediate benefits with long-term sustainability, ensuring that the game's dynamics remain stable and beneficial for all participants.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate initially to build up resources, defect when conditions are favorable (high stock, positive trend), and adjust based on feedback. Specifically:

- **Start by Cooperating**: For the first few rounds, choose C to maintain resource levels.
- **Defect at High Levels**: Choose D if the stock exceeds 80% of capacity and is increasing.
- **Cooperate When Low**: If the stock drops below 40%, switch to C to preserve resources.
- **Adapt Based on Trends**: Monitor recent stock trends; cooperate if decreasing, defect if increasing.
- **Gradually Defect Later**: Shift towards D in the final rounds to maximize gains.

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability. The boxed answer is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially and when stock is low or decreasing; defect when high and increasing}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_7 = '''
The optimal strategy for maximizing individual payoffs while maintaining sustainable stock levels involves a dynamic approach based on the current state of the game and recent cooperation rates. Here are the key steps and decision rules:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to maximize the stock level for future rounds.
2. **Dynamic Thresholding**: Use a threshold that decreases as the game progresses. Players Cooperate if the current Sustainability Index (SI) is above their dynamic threshold, otherwise Defect.
3. **Stage-Based Adjustments**:
   - **Early Stages**: High threshold to encourage cooperation.
   - **Middle Stages**: Moderate threshold, adjusting based on past Cooperation Rates and SI trends.
   - **Late Stages**: Shift back towards higher cooperation to maximize payoffs without over-depleting the stock for non-existent future rounds.
4. **Feedback Mechanism**: If the stock drops significantly below a certain level, players increase cooperation in subsequent rounds to allow recovery.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - First round: Always Cooperate.
   - Last few rounds: Increase Cooperation to prevent endgame depletion and maximize individual payoffs.

The decision rule can be succinctly expressed as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock is above threshold or late stages; otherwise Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_8 = '''
The strategy is designed to balance cooperation with defecting when necessary, adapting to observed behavior and stock levels. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Thresholds

**Initialization:**
- Start by Cooperating (C) in the first round to encourage resource sustainability.

**For Each Round (from 1 to r):**

1. **Observe Current State:**
   - Check current stock level (S).
   - Review recent history of other players' actions and past stock levels.

2. **Determine Safe Thresholds:**
   - Define a safe stock threshold, e.g., 30% of capacity, to prevent collapse.
   - Calculate a cooperation score based on recent rounds (e.g., number of Cooperates vs Defects).

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **If it's the first round:** Choose Cooperate (C).
   - **If approaching the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%):**
     - If S is above a high threshold, Cooperate to sustain.
     - Else, Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Else:**
     - Check if stock S is below safe threshold or cooperation score indicates many Defectors:
       - If yes, choose Defect (D) to prevent further depletion and punish non-cooperation.
       - If no, choose Cooperate (C) to maintain resource health.

4. **Adjustments Based on History:**
   - Use a moving average of recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5) to weigh cooperation score more heavily on recent actions.
   - If detecting potential collapse (S approaching 0 in next rounds), choose Defect to maximize current gain.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock_history, other_actions):
    capacity = stock_history[0]  # initial capacity
    S = stock_history[-1]
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    safe_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    end_rounds = max(2, total_rounds // 10)
    
    if total_rounds - round_number < end_rounds:
        if S > 0.75 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    recent_defectors = sum(1 for a in other_actions[-3:] if a == 'D')
    cooperation_score = len(other_actions) - recent_defectors
    
    if S < safe_threshold or recent_defectors > (len(other_actions) * 0.6):
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization:** Start with Cooperate to build a sustainable base.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
  - First round: Cooperate to encourage mutual resource preservation.
  - Last few rounds: Switch to cautious behavior, Cooperating only if the stock is sufficiently high; otherwise, Defect to maximize payoff before the game ends.
- **Decision Logic:**
  - Monitor stock levels and recent actions of others.
  - If stock is too low or many opponents have Defected recently, switch to Defect to prevent resource collapse.
  - Otherwise, Cooperate to sustain the resource for mutual benefit.

This strategy adapts dynamically based on current conditions and past behavior, aiming to maintain a balance between cooperation and self-interest.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_9 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold**

1. **Initialization**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage mutual cooperation among all players.

2. **Midgame Adaptation**:
   - Monitor the stock level (S) and its trend over past rounds.
   - If S remains above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating to maintain sustainable use.
   - If S drops below this threshold due to increased Defection, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs while preventing further resource depletion.

3. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last few rounds (e.g., last 20%), consider increasing defection frequency to capture higher short-term gains since future rounds are limited.

4. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After defecting for a period, reassess the stock trend. If it stabilizes or increases, revert to Cooperating to encourage sustainability and potential mutual cooperation again.

5. **Dynamic Threshold**: Adjust the threshold based on historical data and opponent behavior patterns observed in previous rounds to enhance adaptability.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
Initialize cooperate = True
threshold = 0.8 * capacity

for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        stock_change = calculate_stock_trend()
        
        if current_stock >= threshold and stock_change > -epsilon:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    
    if action == D and current_stock < threshold:
        defect_rounds += 1
        if defect_rounds >= reset_threshold and check_stock_recovery():
            cooperate = True
            defect_rounds = 0

    record_action_and_payoff(action, payoff)
    
if t is in last 20% of rounds:
    action = D  # Adjust based on remaining rounds and stock status
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy starts with cooperation to foster a cooperative environment.
- It adapts by defecting when the resource is under threat to prevent further depletion.
- Forgiveness is incorporated to encourage sustainability if conditions improve.
- Endgame adjustments focus on maximizing individual payoffs in the final rounds.

This approach balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically to various opponent behaviors and game states.

description_COLLECTIVE_10 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize long-term payoffs by maintaining a sustainable common pool through adaptive cooperation.

---

### **1. Initial Considerations**
- The game begins with the stock at its maximum capacity (S = capacity). Each player can choose to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round.
- Cooperation leads to smaller immediate gains but preserves the resource for future rounds, while defection yields higher immediate payoffs at the risk of depleting the pool.

---

### **2. Strategy Design**

#### **a. Decision Rules:**
1. **Cooperation Threshold:**
   - Cooperate if a majority (or specified proportion) of other players cooperated in the previous round.
   - Defect if a significant portion defected, signaling a need to prompt others to reconsider their strategies.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Monitor the stock level and growth rate to assess sustainability.
   - If the stock is declining significantly due to high defection rates, adjust strategy towards cooperation to replenish the resource.

---

#### **b. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to set a positive precedent and encourage mutual resource preservation.
  
- **Last Round (Known):** Cooperate to maximize final payoff, assuming others follow the strategy.

- **Unknown Last Round:** Continue cooperating to sustain benefits indefinitely, focusing on long-term gains over short-term exploitation.

---

### **3. Collective Mindset Alignment**

- The strategy prioritizes group welfare by encouraging cooperation when beneficial, ensuring sustainable resource use and maximizing mutual payoffs.

---

### **4. Pseudocode Outline**

```python
def decide_action(history):
    # history contains previous rounds' actions and stock levels
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate proportion of cooperators in the last few rounds
    recent_coop = sum(1 for action in history[-5:] if action == 'C') / len(history[-5:])
    
    # Check if the majority cooperated
    if recent_coop > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Consider stock health; if it's low, prioritize cooperation to replenish
        if current_stock < (capacity * 0.4):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

---

### **5. Testing Edge Cases and Refinement**

- **Low Stock Threshold:** If the stock falls below a critical level (e.g., 40% of capacity), prioritize cooperation to prevent depletion.
- **Adaptive Learning:** Adjust thresholds based on historical payoffs, maintaining cooperation if it leads to higher cumulative benefits.

---

### **6. Conclusion**

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation when beneficial and adapting to other players' behaviors. It aims to maintain a healthy resource pool, ensuring mutual benefit for all participants over multiple rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_11 = '''
To design an optimal strategy for balancing cooperation and defection based on observed stock levels, we consider the following key points:

1. **Initial Phase**: Start by cooperating to encourage sustainability.
2. **Monitoring**: Track the average stock level over recent rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds) and observe trends in stock changes.
3. **Decision Making**:
   - If the average stock is above 80% of capacity and trending upwards or stable, continue cooperating.
   - If the average stock drops below 75% or shows a downward trend, start defecting to maximize immediate payoffs while signaling others about the need for conservation.
4. **Hysteresis**: Introduce different thresholds for switching between cooperation and defection to avoid oscillations. For example, switch to defect when the stock drops below 75%, and return to cooperate when it rises above 85%.
5. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last 10% of rounds, increase the tendency to defect as future impact is minimal.

### Final Strategy
The optimal strategy is to cooperate when the average stock level over recent rounds exceeds 80% of capacity and defect otherwise. This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

If the stock decreases after a round, indicating excessive consumption, players switch to Cooperating to help replenish the resource. Conversely, if the stock remains stable or increases, they can safely Defect for higher individual payoffs. In the final round, all players Defect since there's no future benefit to sustain.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if previous round caused a decrease; else defect. Always defect in last round}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_13 = '''
The optimal strategy for deciding whether to cooperate or defect is based on initial cooperation, monitoring others' actions and stock levels, and adapting behavior accordingly. Here are the key steps:

1. **Initial Rounds**: Start with cooperating to encourage sustainability and observe others' behaviors.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - Check if the current stock is above a critical level (e.g., 80% of capacity).
   - If both cooperation rate is high (say >60%) and stock is healthy, continue cooperating.
   - If either condition fails, switch to defecting.

3. **Final Rounds**: In the last few rounds, defect more aggressively since there's no future impact beyond maximizing immediate gains.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on observed behaviors and resource levels.

### Final Answer
The optimal strategy is to initially cooperate, monitor others' actions and stock levels, continue cooperating if cooperation rates are high and the stock remains healthy, and switch to defecting otherwise, especially in later rounds. This approach can be succinctly expressed as \boxed{\text{Cooperate Initially and Adapt Based on Observations}}.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_14 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a shared-resource setting, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to help maintain a healthy resource level for future rounds.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment Based on Stock Health**: For each subsequent round before the last:
   - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, continue Cooperating to sustain the resource.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoff, signaling overexploitation.

3. **Final Round Exploitation**: In the final round, defect to extract as much resource as possible without concern for future rounds.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set a cooperation threshold at 75% of capacity.
   - Track past stock levels and others' actions to inform decisions.

2. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate to contribute to maintaining the resource's health.

3. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - Compare the current stock level to the threshold (75% capacity).
     - If above: Cooperate, supporting sustainable use.
     - If below: Defect, prioritizing immediate gain when overexploitation is evident.

4. **Last Round Action**:
   - Always Defect to exploit remaining resources without regard for future sustainability.

### Justification

This strategy balances individual payoff maximization with collective resource sustainability. By Cooperating initially and continuing while the stock remains healthy, players contribute to long-term gains. Switching to Defecting when the stock is low prevents losses from overexploitation by others. Finally, defecting in the last round ensures maximum immediate benefit without concern for future depletions.

### Answer

The proposed strategy balances individual payoff maximization with collective resource sustainability as follows:

1. **Cooperate** in the first round to support resource health.
2. **Cooperate** in subsequent rounds if the stock remains above 75% of capacity; otherwise, **Defect**.
3. **Defect** in the final round to maximize immediate payoff.

This approach is encapsulated as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially and sustainably, defect when overexploitation occurs or in the final round}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_15 = '''
The optimal strategy is for each player to Cooperate in all rounds except the last one, where they Defect. This preserves the resource until the final round, allowing maximum payoffs without causing a crash.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate in all rounds except the last, where you defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_16 = '''
To address the problem of promoting cooperation while adapting to defection in a shared-resource setting, we can outline a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. This strategy is designed to encourage cooperative behavior when beneficial but also allows for self-interested actions when necessary.

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Initial Cooperation**:
   - Begin by cooperating in the first round. This sets a positive tone and supports sustainable use of the resource.
   
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**:
   - In each subsequent round, evaluate the current stock level relative to its capacity.
     - If the stock is above 80% of capacity, continue to cooperate. The resource is sufficiently healthy, and cooperation helps maintain it.
     
3. **Low Stock Response**:
   - If the stock drops below 30% of capacity, switch to defecting. At this point, the resource is critically low, and defecting allows you to maximize immediate gains before potential collapse.
   
4. **Middle Ground Decision**:
   - For stock levels between 30% and 80%, assess recent cooperation rates:
     a. Review the proportion of cooperators in the last few rounds (e.g., the past 5 rounds).
     b. If a majority were cooperating, continue to cooperate to support sustainability.
     c. If more players have been defecting, switch to defecting as well. This prevents being exploited by others and secures higher personal payoff.

### **Rationale**

- **Cooperation Initiation**: Starting with cooperation fosters an environment where sustainable practices can thrive, encouraging others to follow suit.
- **Stock Thresholds**: Using clear thresholds (80% and 30%) provides a structured approach to decision-making based on the resource's health. This helps in maintaining cooperation when it is beneficial and switching strategies when necessary.
- **Behavioral Adaptation**: By monitoring recent cooperation rates, the strategy adapts dynamically to changes in others' behaviors. It ensures that your actions align with the collective behavior of the group, either promoting sustainability or securing personal gains when defection prevails.

This approach effectively balances self-interest with the greater good, ensuring adaptability and sustainability based on current conditions and others' actions.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to adaptively balance cooperation and defection based on the observed state of the common pool. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. Initial Rounds (First Few):
- **Action:** Cooperate
  - Reasoning: Maintaining the stock at capacity ensures sustainable payoffs and prevents early depletion.

### 2. Middle Rounds:
- **Monitor Stock Level:**
  - Track the stock level after each round to detect trends of increase or decrease.
  - If the stock is consistently decreasing, it indicates that some players are defecting.

### 3. Adaptation Based on Stock Health:
- **Critical Threshold (e.g., 50% of Capacity):**
  - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to defecting more to maximize immediate gains.
  - Gradual Adjustment: Instead of an abrupt switch, increase defection rates as the stock decreases, only fully defecting near critical levels.

### 4. Endgame Handling:
- **Last Few Rounds:**
  - If the stock is above a certain level, cooperate to maintain it and avoid sudden depletion.
  - If the stock is low, defect to maximize remaining payoffs.

### Strategy Summary:

**Pseudocode:**

```
for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        stock_history = observe(stock_levels)
        if stock_level > threshold_high (e.g., 75% of capacity):
            action = Cooperate
        elif stock_level < threshold_low (e.g., 25% of capacity):
            action = Defect
        else:
            # Adjust based on trend and previous actions
            if stock_history shows decreasing trend:
                increase_defection_probability()
            else:
                decrease_defection_probability()
    play(action)
```

### Key Considerations:

- **Stock Dynamics:** The strategy relies on the observable state of the stock, using it as an implicit signal for others' behaviors.
- **Gradual Adaptation:** Avoids abrupt switches to prevent crashes and ensures smoother transitions between cooperation and defection phases.
- **Edge Cases:** Handles first and last rounds with specific actions to maintain sustainability or maximize payoffs.

This approach aims to maximize individual payoffs while sustaining the resource, balancing self-interest with collective preservation.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Cooperation Strategy**

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on observed player behavior, current stock levels, and the number of rounds remaining.

---

### **1. Initial Round (Round 1):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - Rationale: Starting with cooperation encourages sustainability and provides a basis for observing others' behaviors.

---

### **2. Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r):**
#### **a. Observation and Analysis:**
- Track the average cooperation rate of other players over past rounds.
- Consider weighting more recent rounds to adapt quickly to changing strategies.
- Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.

#### **b. Decision Criteria:**
1. **Average Cooperation Rate (ACR):**
   - If ACR > 60%:
     - Continue Cooperating (C) if the stock is above a safe threshold (e.g., half of capacity).
   - Else:
     - Tend towards Defecting (D) to prevent stock depletion.

2. **Stock Level:**
   - If stock < Safe Threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity):
     - Increase tendency to defect, even if ACR is high.

3. **Rounds Remaining:**
   - As rounds_remaining decreases:
     - Gradually increase the tendency to defect, especially in the last few rounds.

---

### **3. Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        # Calculate average cooperation rate of others (ACR)
        ACR = calculate_average_cooperation(others_actions, window=5)
        
        # Get current stock level
        S = current_stock
        
        # Determine safe threshold based on capacity
        safe_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        
        # Check rounds remaining
        rounds_remaining = r - t + 1
        
        if ACR > 0.6 and S >= safe_threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            # If stock is low or cooperation is low, defect
            action = D
            
    play action
```

---

### **4. Strategy Summary:**
- **Cooperate Initially:** Start with cooperation to encourage sustainability.
- **Adapt Based on Others' Behavior:** Observe and adapt to the average cooperation of others, defecting if too many players defect.
- **Consider Stock Levels:** Cooperate only if the stock is sufficiently high; defect otherwise to prevent collapse.
- **Adjust for Game End:** Increase defection as rounds remaining decrease to maximize immediate gains.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with responsiveness to other players' actions and changing game dynamics.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_19 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation for long-term sustainability while maximizing immediate gains, especially in scenarios where other players may defect, we propose a structured strategy. This strategy adapts based on the current state of the resource (stock level) and the behavior of other players.

### Approach
The approach is divided into three main phases:

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase**: Start by cooperating when the stock is at its maximum capacity to maintain a stable resource level.
2. **Sustainability Maintenance Phase**: Continue cooperating as long as the stock remains above a safe threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity). If the stock drops below this threshold despite others mostly cooperating, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds.
3. **Short-Term Maximization Phase**: In the last few rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoffs since there are no future rounds left for recovery.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, historical_cooperation):
    # Threshold definitions based on capacity
    threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.6 * capacity
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'Cooperate'  # Start with cooperation at full stock
    elif round_number >= total_rounds - 2:
        return 'Defect'     # Defect in last few rounds to maximize payoff
    
    # Check if the current stock is above high threshold
    if current_stock > threshold_high:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # If below high but above low, check historical cooperation and trends
    elif current_stock > threshold_low:
        # Calculate average cooperation rate from previous rounds
        avg_coop = sum(historical_cooperation) / len(historical_cooperation)
        
        if avg_coop >= 0.7:  # High cooperation among others
            return 'Cooperate'
        else:
            # Check if stock is decreasing despite our cooperation
            last_stock = historical_cooperation[-1]['stock']
            if current_stock < last_stock:
                return 'Defect'
            else:
                return 'Cooperate'
    else:  # Below low threshold, switch to defecting
        return 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins by cooperating when the stock is at its maximum capacity. This helps in maintaining a sustainable resource level.
  
- **Sustainability Check**: The strategy maintains cooperation as long as the stock remains above 80% of the capacity. If the stock drops below this threshold, it evaluates whether other players are also cooperating. If others are mostly cooperating but the stock is still decreasing, the strategy switches to defecting in subsequent rounds to maximize immediate gains.

- **Short-Term Maximization**: In the final few rounds, the strategy defects to ensure maximum payoffs since there are no future rounds left for recovery or resource replenishment.

This approach dynamically balances between maintaining cooperation for long-term sustainability and adapting to defect when necessary, ensuring a robust strategy against various player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_20 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining sustainable resource use among self-interested players without communication, we propose a conditional cooperation strategy based on observed behavior. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating, ensuring the resource remains at a sustainable level.

2. **Monitor Others' Actions**: Each player observes and records the actions (cooperate or defect) of all other players in each round over a specified window of past rounds.

3. **Calculate Average Cooperation Rate**: For each round, determine the average cooperation rate among other players by dividing the number of cooperators by the total number of other players.

4. **Set Thresholds**: Establish a threshold cooperation rate (e.g., 80%) above which players will continue to cooperate. If the observed rate falls below this threshold, players switch to defecting.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Review and adjust thresholds based on game dynamics, ensuring adaptability to different numbers of players and resource capacities.

6. **Feedback Loop**: Players reassess their strategy periodically using recent data, maintaining cooperation when others do and defecting when necessary to prevent over-depletion.

This strategy encourages mutual cooperation by rewarding those who sustain the resource and deters defection through collective action without communication.

**Answer:**

To balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a scenario where players cannot communicate, employ a conditional cooperation strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to maintain resource levels.
2. **Observe Behavior**: Track other players' actions over recent rounds.
3. **Calculate Cooperation Rate**: Determine the average rate at which others cooperate.
4. **Set Thresholds**: Cooperate if others' rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 80%); defect otherwise.
5. **Adjust Dynamically**: Modify thresholds based on game dynamics for adaptability.

This approach promotes sustainable resource use by fostering cooperation and deterring defection through observed behavior patterns.

To address the problem of managing a shared resource sustainably, we propose a strategic approach that balances cooperation with necessary defection based on the current state and trends of the resource. Here is the organized solution:

### Strategy for Managing Shared Resource

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - Always cooperate in the first round to start with a positive action, helping maintain the resource at its initial healthy level.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - **Cooperation Threshold**: Cooperate if the current stock is above 90% of capacity. This ensures the resource remains stable and sustainable.
   - **Defection Threshold**: Defect if the current stock drops below 20% of capacity. At this point, maximizing immediate payoff becomes crucial as recovery may not be feasible.

3. **Monitoring Trends**:
   - Track trends in the resource's health over recent rounds (e.g., using a moving average or observing consistent decreases despite cooperation). If the resource shows a significant downward trend despite others' cooperative efforts, consider defecting to prevent further depletion.

4. **Handling the Last Round**:
   - If the number of rounds is known and it's the last round, defecting may be optimal for maximizing individual payoff. However, this should be done cautiously as it can lead to a tragedy of the commons if others also defect.

### Summary of Decision Rules

- **Cooperate** when the current stock exceeds 90% of capacity.
- **Defect** when the stock falls below 20% of capacity.
- In between, continue cooperating to encourage resource recovery. If the resource shows a consistent decline despite cooperation, consider defecting to mitigate further loss.

This strategy aims to maximize long-term payoff by maintaining the resource's health while allowing for necessary defection in critical situations. It balances individual incentives with collective sustainability.

To address the problem of balancing exploitation and conservation of a shared resource in an environment where all players have perfect information, we can employ a straightforward threshold-based strategy. This strategy ensures that we take advantage of the resource when it's abundant while preserving it when it becomes scarce.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Thresholds:** Establish two thresholds based on the capacity of the shared resource:
   - High Threshold (T_high): Set at 75% of the resource's capacity.
   - Low Threshold (T_low): Set at 25% of the resource's capacity.

2. **Decision Rules:**
   - If the current stock level exceeds T_high (75%), defect to exploit the abundance.
   - If the current stock is below T_low (25%), cooperate to help preserve the resource.
   - Between these thresholds, employ a cautious approach by evaluating recent trends in stock levels and adjusting behavior accordingly.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:** Monitor the trend of stock levels over previous rounds. If the stock has been decreasing, increase the tendency to cooperate even if above T_low. Conversely, if the stock is increasing, lean towards defecting when above T_high.

4. **Implementation:** Apply these rules dynamically in each round based on the current stock level and recent trends to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

**Answer:**

To effectively manage the shared resource while considering the impact of all players' actions, employ a threshold-based strategy:

- Defect if the current stock exceeds 75% of capacity.
- Cooperate if the current stock falls below 25% of capacity.
- Adjust behavior cautiously between these thresholds based on recent trends in stock levels.

This approach ensures sustainable exploitation while mitigating the risk of resource depletion.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when stock is below 25% and defect when above 75%, adjusting cautiously in between.}}

**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection based on the current stock level, historical player behavior, and game dynamics. It promotes sustainability while adapting to exploiters.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: Cooperate or Defect?**

Players will:

- **Cooperate** if:
  - The current stock \( S \) is above a dynamically adjusted threshold \( T \).
  - A majority of players have cooperated in recent rounds, indicating collective effort to sustain resources.
  
- **Defect** if:
  - \( S \) is below \( T \), signaling immediate gains are necessary before depletion.
  - Recent actions show significant defection, prompting self-protection.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage resource growth and set a positive trend.
  
- **Last Round (Round r)**:
  - Defect if others are expected to defect to maximize immediate payoff.
  - Consider cooperating if expecting mutual cooperation, ensuring shared benefits.

- **Stock Near Capacity or Zero**:
  - Cooperate near capacity to sustain growth.
  - Defect near zero to salvage remaining resources before depletion.

---

### **3. Collective Mindset:**

The strategy emphasizes long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation when beneficial for the group. Players weigh immediate gains against future sustainability, aiming for mutual benefits through resource preservation.

---

### **Implementation Summary:**

- **Initial Threshold \( T \)**: Set as a fraction of capacity (e.g., 50%).
- **Adaptation**: Adjust \( T \) based on stock trends and player behavior.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitor recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5) to gauge cooperation levels.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = maximum_stock_level
    r = total_rounds
    
    # Dynamic threshold adjustment based on stock health
    if stock > 0.5 * capacity:
        threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    else:
        threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    
    # Check recent cooperation trends
    recent_coop_count = sum(1 for h in history[-5:] if 'C' in h.values())
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:
        # Last round: defect if expecting others to defect, else cooperate
        if recent_coop_count / len(history) < 0.5:

        else:
            return 'C'
    else:
        if stock > threshold and recent_coop_count >= n * 0.6:
            return 'C'

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

**Objective:** To maximize long-term collective payoff by balancing individual gains with sustainable resource management.

---

#### **1. Decision Rules**

Players use an *adaptive threshold* approach to decide whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round, based on the current stock level and historical trends.

**Threshold Formula:**
- Calculate a dynamic threshold `T` for cooperation:
  \[
  T = \text{capacity} \times (1 - \alpha)
  \]
  where `α` is an adaptation factor derived from historical stock trends.
  
**Dynamic Adaptation of α:**
- Initialize `α` as 0.2 (moderate conservation).
- After each round, update `α` based on the average stock level over the past 3 rounds:
  - If stock increases or remains stable: decrease `α` by 5% (encourage cooperation).
  - If stock decreases: increase `α` by 10% (punish defection).

**Cooperation vs. Defection Decision:**
- Cooperate (C) if current stock \( S \geq T \).
- Defect (D) if current stock \( S < T \).

---

#### **2. Edge Case Handling**

##### **First Round:**
- Start with Cooperation to preserve the initial high stock level and encourage others to follow suit.
  - Set `α = 0.1` for the first round to promote cooperation.

##### **Last Round (Round r):**
- Defect unconditionally in the last round since there is no future payoff to consider.
  - Override threshold-based decision to maximize immediate gain.

##### **Near-Zero Stock:**
- If stock \( S < n \times \text{minimum consumption} \), all players will defect to prevent total depletion.

---

#### **3. Collective Alignment**

The strategy aligns with a *collective mindset* of sustainability and mutual benefit by:

1. Encouraging cooperation when the resource is abundant (above threshold).
2. Punishing defection through dynamic adaptation of `α` when the resource is threatened.
3. Prioritizing long-term payoff over short-term gains.

---

#### **4. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def atc_strategy(player_index, history, current_stock):
    # Parameters initialization
    capacity = 100  # Example value; replace with actual game parameter
    n = 4           # Number of players
    
    if not hasattr(atc_strategy, 'alpha'):
        atc_strategy.alpha = 0.2  # Initial adaptation factor
    
    # Calculate threshold for cooperation
    threshold = capacity * (1 - atc_strategy.alpha)
    
    # Historical stock trends adjustment
    if len(history) >= 3:
        recent_stock_avg = sum([h['stock'] for h in history[-3:]]) / 3
        if current_stock > recent_stock_avg:
            atc_strategy.alpha = max(atc_strategy.alpha - 0.05, 0.1)
        else:
            atc_strategy.alpha = min(atc_strategy.alpha + 0.1, 0.8)
    
    # Decision rules
    if current_stock >= threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Edge case handling: Last round
if current_round == r:
    return 'D'
```

---

### Explanation

- **Adaptive Threshold (T):** Dynamically adjusts based on historical stock trends to balance cooperation and defection.
- **Initial Conservation:** Starts with moderate cooperation in the first round to encourage collective resource preservation.
- **Defection Punishment:** Gradually increases `α` when stock decreases, making it harder for players to cooperate in future rounds (punishing past defection).
- **Robustness:** The strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors because it does not rely on coordination or knowledge of other players' strategies—it only depends on observable state and history.

This approach promotes a collective mindset while ensuring individual adaptability to changing game conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_25 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation**

1. **Initial Target**: Set an initial target at 75% of the capacity (0.75 × capacity). Players Cooperate if the current stock is above this target; otherwise, they Defect.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment**: After each round:
   - If the stock increased from the previous round, lower the target by a small adjustment factor to encourage more cooperation.
   - If the stock decreased or remained stable despite cooperation, raise the target slightly to conserve resources.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate as the stock is at maximum capacity.
   - **Last Few Rounds (r-2 onwards)**: Switch to Cooperating again to prevent a final rush of Defectors, ensuring sustainable resource management.

4. **Feedback Loop**: Players adjust their target based on the stock's trend, maintaining sustainability and preventing over-consumption.

5. **Consistency and Adaptability**: By following the same rules, players create a self-reinforcing loop encouraging cooperation when resources are abundant. The strategy adapts to changing conditions caused by other opponents' behaviors.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```python
capacity = given_capacity
target = 0.75 * capacity
adjustment_factor = 0.01 * capacity  # 1% of capacity

for current_round in range(1, r + 1):
    if current_round == 1 or current_round >= r - 2:
        action = "Cooperate"
    else:
        if stock >= target:
            action = "Cooperate"
        else:
            action = "Defect"
    
    # Perform the round with 'action'
    
    # After the round, update target based on stock change
    new_stock = min(S_remaining + growth, capacity)
    if new_stock > previous_stock:
        # Stock increased; allow more cooperation
        target = max(target - adjustment_factor, 0.5 * capacity)
    else:
        # Stock decreased or same; conserve resources
        target = min(target + adjustment_factor, capacity)

    previous_stock = new_stock
```

This strategy ensures a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation levels based on the observed state of the resource pool.

To design a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that balances individual gain with sustainability, we propose an adaptive approach based on current stock levels and recent player behavior. The strategy encourages cooperation when sustainable but allows defecting to prevent resource depletion or exploitation.

### Strategy Description

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to promote initial sustainability.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds (t=2 to r-1):**
  - Calculate the defect rate from the previous round.
    - If more than half of players defected, defect this round.
    - Otherwise, check the current stock level relative to capacity.
      - If the stock is below a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), defect.
      - Else, cooperate.

- **Last Round (t=r):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff as there's no future impact.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- In the first round, always cooperate to encourage others to maintain sustainability.
- In the last round, defect since there’s no need for future cooperation.
- If the stock drops below a critical threshold despite low defect rates, switch to defecting to prevent further depletion.

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

The strategy promotes collective welfare by cooperating when sustainable and defecting only when necessary, thus balancing individual gains with group interests.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_round, current_stock, capacity, previous_defects):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        defect_rate = sum(previous_defects) / len(previous_defects)
        if defect_rate > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
            if stock_ratio < 0.6:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy starts by cooperating to set a sustainable tone.
- In subsequent rounds, it considers both recent player behavior and the resource's state.
- If many players are defecting or resources are low, it defects to prevent further harm.
- By adapting based on current conditions, the strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_27 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - All players Cooperate (C) to maximize initial payoff and set a foundation for future cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Each player observes the current stock level.
     - If the stock is above 60% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock drops below 40%, switch to Defecting to apply collective punishment and encourage others to cooperate.
   - Implement hysteresis: Once players start Defecting (when stock < 40%), they continue until the stock recovers above 70%.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Rounds r-2, r-1, r):**
   - Increase tendency towards Defection as there is no future interaction to penalize defection.
   - However, maintain some cooperation if the stock is healthy to prevent total collapse.

4. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Players track the stock history and use a moving average to assess trends (declining or stable).

5. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Maintain consumption rates based on current stock levels to balance personal payoff with resource sustainability.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
for each round in 1..r:
    if round == 1:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        if stock > 0.6 * capacity:
            action = Cooperate
        elif stock < 0.4 * capacity and previous_action_defect:
            action = Defect
        elif stock <= 0.7 * capacity:
            if random() < defect_probability:
                action = Defect
            else:
                action = Cooperate
    perform action, update payoff, adjust stock accordingly
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to build a cooperative foundation.
- **Threshold-Based Actions:** Uses clear thresholds (60%, 40%, 70%) to decide between cooperation and defection, ensuring adaptability without frequent oscillations.
- **Hysteresis Mechanism:** Prevents rapid switching by requiring higher thresholds for reverting to cooperation after defection starts.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** Adjusts behavior in the final rounds to account for no future interactions while still attempting to maintain resource levels.

This strategy balances individual incentives with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation while being robust against defection and varying opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_28 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that adapts based on the current state of the stock and historical actions of other players. The goal is to balance cooperation for sustainable resource use with defection when necessary to prevent rapid depletion.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same, fostering a collaborative environment.
2. **Adaptive Behavior**: For subsequent rounds (from 2 to r-2), adjust actions based on the previous round's cooperation levels and current stock health:
   - If more than 70% of players Cooperated last round and the stock is above 60% capacity, continue Cooperating.
   - Otherwise, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gain while others may be depleting resources.
3. **Final Rounds Strategy**: In the last two rounds (r-1 and r):
   - If the stock is above 70% and cooperation has been high, Cooperate to allow some growth before the game ends.
   - Otherwise, Defect to secure higher immediate payoffs, recognizing that future rounds are limited.

### Decision Rules:

- **Cooperation Conditions**:
  - Previous round had >70% Cooperators.
  - Current stock is above 60% of capacity.
  
- **Defection Conditions**:
  - Less than or equal to 70% Cooperators in the previous round.
  - Stock is low (below 60%) or declining.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Round**: Defect if stock is high to maximize payoff; otherwise, Cooperate slightly to allow minimal growth.
- **Low Stock**: If stock drops below a threshold (e.g., 30%), prioritize Defection to salvage remaining resources.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    current_round = len(history) + 1

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    prev_coop_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C')
    prev_coop_percentage = prev_coop_count / n
    
    if current_round >= r - 1:
        if current_stock > 0.7 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    if prev_coop_percentage > 0.7 and current_stock > 0.6 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Rationale:

- **Sustainability Focus**: By Cooperating when others do, the strategy maintains a healthy stock level for future rounds.
- **Reactiveness**: Adjusting based on previous actions allows the strategy to adapt to changing player behaviors and stock conditions.
- **Risk Management**: In later rounds, the strategy shifts towards maximizing immediate gains if cooperation has failed, preventing total depletion.

This approach ensures that the strategy is both adaptive and robust, capable of performing well across a variety of opponent behaviors while aiming for a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

**Strategy Description: Adaptive Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy aims to balance individual gain with collective sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation based on stock levels, trends, and opponents' behavior.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first few rounds to establish a baseline of behavior and assess others' strategies.

2. **Stock Level Assessment:**
   - **High Stock (>50% capacity):** Cooperate to sustain resource levels, promoting long-term benefits.
   - **Medium Stock (30%-50% capacity):** Cooperate if others are cooperating; defect if many opponents are defecting.
   - **Low Stock (<30% capacity):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff before potential resource crash.

3. **React to Opponents:**
   - Track the number of defectors. If a significant proportion (e.g., >50%) defect, increase defection frequency.

4. **Endgame Handling:**
   - In the last 1-2 rounds, switch to defecting for maximum immediate payoff since future rounds are irrelevant.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, history, remaining_rounds):
    # Initial cooperation in first few rounds
    if len(history) < 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate stock thresholds
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    medium_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    # Check current stock level
    if stock > medium_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif stock < low_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Medium stock: check opponents' behavior
        recent_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-5:] if action == 'D')
        if (recent_defectors / len(history[-5:])) > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

    # Endgame strategy
    if remaining_rounds <= 2:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by cooperating to observe others' strategies and build a sustainable resource base.
- **Stock-Based Decisions:** Adjusts cooperation based on the stock level, aiming to sustain resources when abundant and defecting when low to maximize immediate gain.
- **Opponent Behavior Tracking:** Monitors opponents' actions; if many defect, it adapts by increasing defection frequency to prevent exploitation.
- **Endgame Focus:** Switches to defection in final rounds to exploit the resource for maximum payoff before the game ends.

This strategy balances individual and collective interests, adapting dynamically to maintain sustainability while responding to potential exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_30 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Collective Play**

1. **Initial Round Decision**: Begin with Cooperation to support sustainable resource growth.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation**: After each round, assess the number of Cooperators and Defectors. Use this information to inform future decisions.

3. **Defection Threshold**: Establish a threshold based on stock levels or player actions. If the stock drops below 60% of capacity after several rounds of attempted Cooperation, switch to Defecting in subsequent rounds.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Continuously adjust your strategy based on recent player behavior. If a significant number of players are defecting, consider switching strategies to maximize immediate gains and encourage others to Cooperate.

5. **Last Round Consideration**: In the final round, prioritize maximizing individual gain while maintaining awareness that other players might also be Defecting.

6. **Collective Mindset**: Encourage Cooperation by leading with it, understanding that long-term benefits outweigh short-term gains from Defection.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function decide_action(round_history, current_stock):
    if round is first:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        count_coop = number of players who Cooperated in last rounds
        stock_trend = calculate_stock_trend(round_history)
        
        if count_coop > n/2 and stock_trend >= 0.6 * capacity:
            return Cooperate
        elif current_stock < 0.6 * capacity or count_defect > n/2:
            return Defect
        else:
            return Cooperate

def calculate_stock_trend(round_history):
    # Calculate average stock over recent rounds
    pass
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with Cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base.
- **Monitoring and Adjustment**: Continuously evaluates the effectiveness of Cooperation by tracking player actions and stock levels. Adjusts strategy dynamically based on these metrics.
- **Threshold for Defection**: Switches to Defecting if the stock falls below 60% capacity or if more than half of players are defecting, preventing exploitation and maximizing gains before resource depletion.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with immediate gains, adapting to the behaviors of other players while promoting collective cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_31 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy balances cooperation with defection based on the observed state of the common pool. It aims to sustain the resource while adapting to others' behaviors.

1. **Initial Rounds:** Cooperate in the first 3-5 rounds to encourage a cooperative environment and maintain stock stability.

2. **Monitoring Stock Levels:** After each round, check if the stock after consumption is above or below a threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity).

3. **Detecting Overuse:** If the stock drops below 80% for three consecutive rounds, switch to defecting in the next few rounds to either gain more while the pool is still available or signal others.

4. **Adjusting Based on Recovery:** After switching to defection, if the stock starts recovering (increasing towards capacity) over two or three rounds, revert to cooperation.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Continue Cooperating if the stock is still high; this maintains moderate gains without risking a crash.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
for each round in r:
    if current_round == 1:
        choose C
    else:
        if previous_stock_levels > threshold (e.g., 80% capacity) for most rounds:
            choose C
        elif stock_drops_below_threshold_consecutively(3):
            choose D
        else:
            if recent_recovery_in_stock():
                switch back to C
```

This strategy adaptively balances between cooperation and defection, aiming to maintain a sustainable resource level while responding to collective behavior.

description_COLLECTIVE_32 = '''
**Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize long-term payoffs by balancing cooperation and defection based on the state of the common pool resource. It adapts dynamically to sustain the resource while capitalizing on opportunities when necessary.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start with maximum sustainability, encouraging others to do the same and maintaining a healthy stock level.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **If Stock is Healthy:**
     - **Condition:** Current stock ≥ 70% of capacity AND increasing in the last few rounds.
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Rationale:** Sustaining cooperation maintains resource health and ensures steady payoffs.

   - **If Stock is Depleting:**
     - **Condition:** Current stock < 70% of capacity OR decreasing in the last few rounds.
     - **Action:** Defect.
     - **Rationale:** Higher immediate payoff while preventing further over-depletion, which could lead to resource collapse.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize payoffs in the final rounds without concern for future sustainability since there are no subsequent rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Stock Near Zero:**
  - **Condition:** Stock is very low (near 0).
  - **Action:** Defect.
  - **Rationale:** Salvage any remaining payoff before the resource crashes.

- **Stock Recovery:**
  - **Condition:** After defecting, stock recovers above 70% and shows increasing trend.
  - **Action:** Switch back to Cooperate.
  - **Rationale:** Re-engaging in cooperation helps sustain the resource again for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```pseudocode
for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = C
    elif t > 0.9 * r:  # Last 10% of rounds
        action = D
    else:
        stock_trend = check_stock_trend()
        if current_stock >= 0.7 * capacity and stock_trend == increasing:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    submit_action(action)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by cooperating to maintain sustainability, setting a positive precedent.
- **Adaptive Defection:** Monitors the stock's health and trends. If the stock is depleting or below a threshold (70%), defects to maximize immediate gains while preventing further overuse.
- **Final Round Strategy:** In the last 10% of rounds, defects to extract maximum possible payoff without worrying about future sustainability.

This strategy balances between maintaining resource health and maximizing payoffs, adapting dynamically based on observed conditions.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation and defection based on the current state of the common pool and the progression of the game. The goal is to sustain the resource while maximizing payoffs, adapting dynamically to changes in stock levels and rounds remaining.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource level.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: Continuously assess the current stock against predefined thresholds (70% as high, 30% as low).
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**:
   - **Cooperate** if the stock is above 70%, indicating sustainability.
   - **Defect** if the stock drops below 30%, signaling potential collapse.
4. **Mid-Game Adjustments**: If the stock trends downward despite cooperation, switch to defection to prevent further depletion.
5. **Endgame Defection**: In the last 10% of rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoffs with no future rounds left.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(stock, round_number, total_rounds, capacity):
    high_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    endgame_trigger = total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10)
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    if round_number > endgame_trigger:
        return 'D'  # Defect in the last 10% of rounds
    
    if stock >= high_threshold and (stock - capacity) < 0:  # Stock is high but not exceeding capacity
        return 'C'
    elif stock <= low_threshold or (stock - capacity) > 0:  # Stock is too low or over capacity
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Check if the stock is growing and cooperation rate is sufficient
        if calculate_growth(stock, capacity) > 0 and count_cooperate_last_round() / n > 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

def calculate_growth(current_stock, capacity):
    remaining = current_stock - sum(consumptions)
    growth = 2 * remaining * (1 - remaining / capacity)
    return growth
```

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Few Rounds**: Switch to Defecting as there's no future benefit in preserving the resource.

This strategy aims to sustain the common pool while adaptively responding to stock levels and game progression, promoting collective cooperation for long-term benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_34 = '''
To design a robust strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on balancing immediate payoffs with sustainable resource management. The strategy adapts based on the current stock level relative to a dynamic threshold, encouraging cooperation when resources are sufficient and defecting when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to maintain or build up the stock.
2. **Dynamic Threshold**: Use a dynamic threshold to decide between cooperation and defection. The threshold adjusts based on previous rounds' stock changes.
3. **Threshold-Based Decision**:
   - **Cooperate**: If the current stock is above the threshold, especially in early rounds.
   - **Defect**: If the stock is at or below the threshold, especially as the game progresses or near its end.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds):
    # Initial threshold set at 75% of capacity
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    
    # Adjust threshold based on previous stock changes (hypothetical function)
    if round_number > 1:
        threshold *= 0.95  # Lower threshold slightly each round to account for depletion risk
    
    # Check if it's the last round
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'  # Defect in the last round to maximize immediate gain
    
    # Decision based on current stock relative to threshold
    if current_stock >= threshold and (round_number != total_rounds):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage over rounds
for t in range(1, r+1):
    action = decide_action(stock_level[t], capacity, t, r)
    # Record action and update stock for next round
```

### Decision Rules:

- **Cooperate (C)**: When the current stock is above the dynamic threshold, indicating sufficient resources to sustain cooperation.
- **Defect (D)**: When the current stock is at or below the threshold, signaling potential depletion risks.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round**: Always cooperate to maintain a high starting point and encourage others to do the same.
- **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future punishment.
- **Unknown Last Rounds**: Treat each round similarly, using the dynamic threshold approach to balance between cooperation and defection.

### Robustness:

This strategy is robust as it dynamically adjusts to changing stock levels, encouraging cooperation when resources are plentiful and defecting when necessary. It doesn't rely on others' strategies beyond observing the stock, making it adaptable against various opponent behaviors.

By following this strategy, players aim to maximize their total payoffs over multiple rounds while maintaining sustainable resource management, leading to more stable outcomes compared to static cooperation or defection strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_35 = '''
To address the problem of sustaining cooperation while maximizing individual payoff over multiple rounds, the proposed strategy is as follows:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same.

2. **Adaptive Cooperation**: For each subsequent round before the last 25%, observe the percentage of players who Cooperated in the immediately preceding round.
   - If more than half (50%) of the players Cooperated, continue to Cooperate.
   - If 50% or fewer Cooperated, switch to Defecting.

3. **Final Stage Exploitation**: In the last 25% of rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate gains without concern for future consequences.

**Answer**: 

The optimal strategy involves initially Cooperating, then mirroring the majority's action in each round until the final quarter, where you switch to Always Defecting. This balances sustaining cooperation when possible with exploiting when beneficial. The strategy is encapsulated as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; mirror majority actions; defect in last 25%.}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_36 = '''
To address the repeated resource management dilemma, we propose a threshold-based strategy that balances cooperation for sustainability with defection for maximizing immediate payoffs. Here's how it works:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Threshold Setting:**
   - **Upper Threshold (H):** Set at 75% of capacity.
   - **Lower Threshold (L):** Set at 60% of capacity.

2. **Decision-Making Rule:**
   - If the current stock level is above H, choose to **cooperate**.
   - If the current stock level is below L, choose to **defect**.
   - Between H and L, additional strategies (e.g., probabilistic cooperation) can be employed.

### Detailed Implementation Steps:

1. **Monitor Current Stock:**
   At each round, assess the current stock level relative to capacity.

2. **Apply Thresholds:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** If stock > 75% of capacity.
     - This maintains resource levels for future rounds.
   - **Defect (D):** If stock < 60% of capacity.
     - Indicates resource overuse; defecting maximizes immediate gain.

3. **Intermediate Range Handling:**
   Between 60% and 75%, consider a gradient approach:
   - Increase cooperation probability as stock approaches H.
   - Decrease cooperation (favor defection) as stock approaches L.

4. **Time-Based Adjustment (Optional):**
   If aware of the remaining rounds, slightly lower H and raise L in later stages to encourage defecting as future impacts diminish.

5. **Continuous Evaluation:**
   Periodically review strategy outcomes and adjust thresholds if necessary to enhance both short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

### Conclusion:
This strategy effectively navigates the trade-off between cooperation for sustainable resource management and defection for immediate payoff optimization, ensuring adaptability across varying game dynamics.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_37 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold Adjustment**

1. **Initial Rounds (Cooperation Phase):**
   - In the first few rounds, always cooperate to encourage a healthy resource base and set a positive trend.

2. **Dynamic Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
   - After the initial cooperation phase, each player calculates an internal threshold based on the observed stock levels.
   - If the current stock (S) is above this threshold, the player cooperates; if below, they defect.
   - The threshold is adjusted dynamically to reflect trends in the stock's health:
     - If the stock is increasing or stable, lower the threshold slightly to encourage more cooperation.
     - If the stock is decreasing significantly, raise the threshold to promote defection and prevent further depletion.

3. **Stock Health Monitoring:**
   - Calculate the average stock level over the past few rounds to determine if it's trending upwards, downwards, or remaining stable.
   - Use this trend to adjust the cooperation-defection balance:
     - Stable or increasing stocks: Increase cooperation efforts.
     - Decreasing stocks: Shift towards more defection to capitalize on remaining resources before collapse.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to initiate a positive cycle of resource management.
   - **Last Few Rounds (Endgame Strategy):** Switch to defecting in the final rounds since there's no future payoff to consider, maximizing immediate gains.

5. **Gradual Adjustment and Smoothing:**
   - Use a weighted average of past stock levels to smooth out short-term fluctuations and base decisions on longer-term trends.
   - Include a mechanism to gradually reduce defection as the stock recovers, preventing overshooting and resource crashes.

6. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   - Encourage each player to independently adjust their actions based on observed stock health, promoting a collective effort to sustain resources without direct communication.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, round_number):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    r = total_rounds

    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to build up resource
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'

    # Calculate past stock trends
    recent_stocks = history[-5:]  # Adjust window size as needed
    average_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
    trend = calculate_trend(recent_stocks)

    # Determine threshold based on current and past stocks
    if trend == 'increasing' or trend == 'stable':
        threshold = max(capacity * 0.6, average_stock - (capacity * 0.1))
    else:
        threshold = min(capacity * 0.4, average_stock + (capacity * 0.1))

    # Decision based on current stock relative to threshold
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def calculate_trend(stock_levels):
    # Implementation to determine if stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable
    pass

# Example usage
history = [100, 95, 80, 75, 60]
current_stock = 60
round_number = 5
action = decide_action(history, current_stock, round_number)
print(action)  # Output: 'D'
```

**Conclusion:**
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation and defection based on the resource's health. It promotes collective responsibility without relying on explicit coordination, making it robust against various opponent behaviors in a tournament setting.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation and Defection Based on Stock and Player Behavior**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Moves):**
   - Start by Cooperating to foster a sustainable stock level and encourage other players to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Decision Criteria:**
     - **Cooperate** if:
       - The majority of players Cooperated in the previous round.
       - Current stock is above 50% of capacity, indicating sufficient resource sustainability.
     - **Defect** if:
       - A significant number of players Defected in the last round, leading to a noticeable drop in stock.
       - Current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), suggesting that future rounds may be unsustainable regardless of current actions.

3. **Later Rounds (As Rounds Remaining Decrease):**
   - Shift towards Defecting more frequently as the number of remaining rounds diminishes, prioritizing immediate gains since there's less incentive to maintain the stock for nonexistent future rounds.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to initiate a sustainable resource pool.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize individual payoff without concern for future depletions.

**Rationale:**
- This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting based on the observed behavior of other players and the current state of the common pool. It encourages cooperation when beneficial but switches to defection if necessary to prevent resource collapse or exploit situations where others are defecting. The approach is robust against varying opponent behaviors and dynamic stock conditions.

**Implementation:**
- Monitor the proportion of Cooperate/Defect actions in each round.
- Track stock levels relative to capacity to adjust thresholds dynamically.
- Gradually increase defection tendency as rounds progress, especially when nearing the end game.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while considering the collective impact on resource sustainability.

To address the problem of sustaining cooperation while avoiding exploitation in a public goods scenario, the proposed strategy balances contribution with self-interest based on observable conditions. Here's a structured summary:

**Strategy: Conditional Cooperation Based on Stock Level**

1. **Cooperate**: If the current stock level (S) is above 80% of its maximum capacity.
2. **Defect**: Otherwise, if S drops below this threshold.

This approach ensures that players contribute to maintaining the resource when it's healthy but switch to exploiting it when it starts to dwindle, aiming to prevent rapid depletion while allowing for potential recovery.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate when the stock exceeds 80% of its maximum capacity and defect otherwise. This balances contribution with self-interest to sustain the resource.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if S > 80\% of capacity, else Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_40 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**
Maximize individual payoff over multiple rounds by balancing resource conservation and exploitation, while adaptively responding to others' behaviors.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative baseline to sustain higher stock levels and encourage mutual benefits.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Past Behavior:**
     - Track the number of defects from other players in recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - **Adjust Strategy Based on Defect Rate:**
     - If defect rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%), switch to Defecting for the next few rounds to signal disapproval and protect against exploitation.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - **High Stock Levels (Above 75% of capacity):**
     - Cooperate to maintain resource health and optimize future payoffs.
   - **Moderate Stock Levels (Between 25%-75% capacity):**
     - Balance between Cooperating and Defecting based on observed defect rates.
   - **Low Stock Levels (Below 25% capacity):**
     - Consider Defecting to exploit remaining resources, but cautiously to avoid collapse.

4. **Last Few Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Lean towards Defecting.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited or nonexistent, reducing incentives for long-term cooperation.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:**
  - Default to Cooperate to initiate a cooperative environment.

- **Last Few Rounds (Last 5% of total rounds):**
  - Shift towards Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future repercussions.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```pseudocode
function decide_action(round_number, stock_level, past_defects):
    if round_number == 1:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        defect_rate = calculate_defect_rate(past_defects)
        
        if stock_level > 0.75 * capacity:
            return Cooperate
        elif stock_level < 0.25 * capacity:
            return Defect
        else:
            if defect_rate > threshold (e.g., 30%):
                return Defect
            else:
                return Cooperate
                
    # For last few rounds
    if round_number >= total_rounds - last_5_percent:
        return Defect
```

**Conclusion:**
This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior, stock levels, and game progression. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and adjusts to exploit or protect against exploitation as needed, ensuring robust performance across diverse scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_41 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to encourage cooperation while adaptively responding to other players' behaviors and the state of the resource. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first few rounds to foster a cooperative environment and gather information about others' actions.

2. **Monitor Behavior**: Track the average cooperation rate among other players each round to inform decision-making.

3. **Dynamic Threshold**: Establish an adaptive threshold for cooperation based on:
   - Current stock level: Higher thresholds when stock is robust.
   - Remaining rounds: Lower thresholds as the game progresses, especially in later rounds.
   - Others' cooperation rates: Adjust threshold to encourage reciprocal behavior.

4. **Decision Rule**:
   - Cooperate if the observed cooperation rate exceeds the threshold.
   - Defect otherwise, particularly if others are defecting or stock is low.

5. **Stock Dynamics Adjustment**: Lower cooperation thresholds when the stock is low to prevent further depletion and allow for recovery.

6. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final few rounds, slightly increase defection rates to capitalize on immediate gains, acknowledging the temptation but balancing it with long-term sustainability.

**Edge Cases Handling**:
- **First Round**: Cooperate without history.
- **Low Stock**: Prioritize defecting to prevent depletion.
- **High Stock**: Maintain cooperation to sustain resource levels.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively responding to the game's dynamics and other players' actions. It aims to foster a cooperative equilibrium while remaining robust against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_42 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Thresholds**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 5% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Establish trust and observe others' behavior, encouraging collective cooperation.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitoring Stock Trends:**
     - Track the stock level changes over consecutive rounds.
     - Calculate the percentage change in stock from one round to the next.
   - **Defection Trigger:**
     - If the stock decreases by more than a threshold (e.g., 5%) for three consecutive rounds, defect in the next round.
     - Continue defecting until the stock shows consistent growth above another threshold (e.g., 3% increase).
   - **Rationale:** Respond to sustained defection trends while preventing over-reaction to minor fluctuations.

3. **Last 10% of Rounds:**
   - **Adjustment:** Use a more lenient trigger for defection, focusing on maximizing immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.
   - **Rationale:** Prioritize short-term gains in the final rounds when there's no future retaliation to consider.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to build trust and set a positive precedent.
- **Last Round:** If beneficial, defect to maximize payoff without concern for future consequences.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Continue cooperating as the stock is stable or growing.
- **Very Low Stock Levels:** Defect if necessary but aim to signal others to cooperate through consistent behavior.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```
for each round t in 1..r:
    if t <= initial_rounds (first 5%):
        action = C
    else:
        calculate stock change from previous rounds
        if sustained decrease > threshold for last x rounds:
            action = D
        elif sustained increase > threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            maintain previous action or default to C

    handle_last_10_percent():
        adjust thresholds towards higher defection likelihood
```

This strategy balances cooperation with adaptive responses to defection, ensuring robustness and adaptability across various scenarios.

description_COLLECTIVE_43 = '''
**Collective Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance between cooperation for sustainability and defection when necessary, ensuring adaptability to various opponent behaviors while maximizing collective payoff.

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Few Rounds):**
   - Cooperate in the first round(s) to maintain a high stock level, promoting sustainable future gains.

2. **Monitor Stock Trends:**
   - Track whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable over recent rounds.
   - If the stock has decreased in each of the last k rounds (e.g., 3), switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoff and prevent further depletion.

3. **Endgame Defection (Last l Rounds):**
   - In the final l rounds (e.g., 10% of total rounds), always defect to secure maximum short-term gains as future payoffs are negligible.

4. **Critical Stock Level Check:**
   - If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), immediately switch to defecting, as growth is minimal and others are likely doing the same.

### **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set initial thresholds (high = 80%, low = 20%) based on capacity.
   - Determine l (e.g., last 10% of rounds) for endgame defection.
   - Choose k (e.g., 3) for trend analysis.

2. **Round-by-Round Execution:**
   - For each round:
     - If in the final l rounds, defect.
     - Else if stock < low threshold, defect.
     - Else if stock > high threshold and stable/increasing, cooperate.
     - Else, check recent trends; defect if stock is decreasing.

3. **Adaptation:**
   - Adjust thresholds or k based on observed behavior to optimize responsiveness without over-reacting.

### **Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
threshold_low = 0.2 * capacity
l = int(0.1 * r)  # last 10% rounds
k = 3  # trend analysis window

for t in range(r):
    if t >= (r - l):
        play D
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        if current_stock < threshold_low:
            play D
        elif current_stock > threshold_high:
            play C
        else:
            recent_stocks = get_last_k_rounds(k)
            if is_decreasing(recent_stocks):
                play D
            else:
                play C
    update_recent_history(current_stock)
```

### **Conclusion:**

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection, ensuring sustainable gains while responding to stock trends and nearing the game's end. It handles edge cases effectively, promoting both collective interest and individual payoff optimization.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_44 = '''
**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to encourage reciprocal cooperation and sustain the resource.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     1. Assess if more than a certain percentage of players (e.g., 70%) cooperated in the previous round.
     2. Check if the current stock level exceeds 75% of the capacity.
     3. If both conditions are satisfied, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Apply the same decision rules but consider that defecting might lead to depletion. Aim to cooperate if others did to maximize collective payoff despite no future rounds.
   - **High Stock (near capacity):** Strongly encourage cooperation for sustainability and growth.
   - **Low Stock:** More likely to Defect, as the resource is strained, balancing immediate gain with long-term risk.

3. **Rationale:**
   - Promotes cooperation when sustainable and reciprocal, ensuring resource replenishment.
   - Adapts to defection by others or low stock, preventing exploitation and potential collapse of the common pool.

This strategy balances individual payoffs with collective sustainability, dynamically adjusting based on observed behavior and resource state.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_45 = '''
To address the problem, we need an adaptive strategy that balances individual gain with the sustainability of the shared resource. The strategy should consider both the current state of the stock and the historical behavior of other players.

### Approach
The approach involves a decision rule based on two key factors:
1. **Current Stock Level**: If the stock is above a certain threshold, it indicates sustainability, prompting cooperation.
2. **Recent Cooperation Rates**: Observing whether most players have been cooperating in recent rounds helps maintain the social contract to sustain the resource.

The strategy dynamically adjusts:
- **Cooperate** if the stock is sufficiently high and recent cooperation rates are strong.
- **Defect** if the stock drops below a threshold or cooperation rates weaken, signaling potential over-depletion.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(stock, history, n_players, capacity):
    # Parameters can be adjusted based on testing
    threshold_stock = 0.6 * capacity
    recent_rounds = 3
    cooperation_threshold = 0.7
    
    if stock >= capacity:
        return 'C'
    
    if len(history) < recent_rounds:
        # Not enough history, default to Cooperate in early rounds
        return 'C'
    
    recent_cooperations = sum([sum(round_actions) for round_actions in history[-recent_rounds:]])
    total_possible = n_players * recent_rounds
    recent_coop_rate = recent_cooperations / total_possible
    
    if stock > threshold_stock and recent_coop_rate > cooperation_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Rounds**: Start by cooperating to build a sustainable resource base.
- **Stock Check**: If the stock is high, continue cooperation to maximize long-term gains.
- **Cooperation Trend**: By monitoring recent cooperation rates, the strategy ensures that actions align with collective efforts to sustain the resource.
- **Adaptive Defection**: If the stock drops or cooperation wanes, defecting helps prevent further depletion and signals others to reconsider their strategies.

This approach balances individual gain with the sustainability of the shared resource, fostering a cooperative environment while being adaptable to changing conditions.

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoffs while maintaining sustainable resource levels through adaptive cooperation and defection.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate (C) vs Defect (D)**

#### **General Approach:**
- The strategy balances self-interest with collective sustainability by adapting actions based on the observed behavior of other players and the current state of the common pool resource.
- Players start by cooperating, then adapt their strategies dynamically in subsequent rounds.

---

#### **Key Decision Factors:**

1. **Current Stock Level (S):**
   - **High Stock (S > 80% of capacity):** Cooperate to sustain long-term resource availability.
     - Rationale: High stock levels can tolerate some consumption while maintaining sustainability.
   - **Medium Stock (40% < S ≤ 80% of capacity):** Cooperate if most other players are cooperating; otherwise, defect.
     - Rationale: Medium stock requires careful management to prevent over-depletion. If others are not cooperating, defecting can maximize individual gains while protecting against exploitation.
   - **Low Stock (S ≤ 40% of capacity):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
     - Rationale: Low stock levels indicate that the resource is under significant stress. Cooperating would result in minimal payoff, and defecting allows players to capture as much value as possible before the resource collapses.

2. **Recent Cooperation Rate (Coop_Rate):**
   - Calculate the proportion of cooperations observed in the last 3 rounds.
   - **High Coop_Rate (>70%):** Cooperate to maintain cooperation and sustain the resource.
     - Rationale: If most players are cooperating, continuing to cooperate helps preserve the resource for future gains.
   - **Low Coop_Rate (≤70%):** Defect to maximize individual payoff while minimizing losses from others' defection.
     - Rationale: If many players are defecting, cooperating would result in being exploited. Defecting allows players to capture more value before the resource is depleted.

3. **Round Number (t):**
   - **First Round (t = 1):** Cooperate to encourage other players to cooperate and start the game sustainably.
     - Rationale: Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent and may encourage others to follow suit.
   - **Middle Rounds (2 ≤ t ≤ r-2):** Use the above factors (stock level and recent cooperation rate) to decide between cooperating or defecting.
     - Rationale: The middle rounds are critical for balancing immediate gains and long-term sustainability.
   - **Last Two Rounds (t = r-1, r):** Defect to maximize individual payoff in the final rounds.
     - Rationale: In the last few rounds, there is no future punishment for overusing the resource. Therefore, defecting allows players to capture as much value as possible.

4. **Stock Growth Potential (Growth_Potential):**
   - Calculate the potential growth of the stock after consumption.
   - If the stock has high growth potential, cooperate to sustain the resource.
     - Rationale: High growth potential indicates that the resource can recover quickly, making cooperation beneficial in the long run.
   - If the stock has low growth potential, defect to maximize immediate payoff.
     - Rationale: Low growth potential means that the resource cannot recover quickly, so defecting allows players to capture as much value as possible before the resource collapses.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling**

1. **First Round (t = 1):**
   - Always Cooperate.
   - Rationale: Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent and may encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Last Two Rounds (t = r-1, r):**
   - Always Defect.
   - Rationale: In the last few rounds, there is no future punishment for overusing the resource. Therefore, defecting allows players to capture as much value as possible.

3. **Stock Near Capacity or Low Levels:**
   - If the stock is near capacity (S > 80% of capacity), Cooperate.
     - Rationale: High stock levels can tolerate some consumption while maintaining sustainability.
   - If the stock is low (S ≤ 40% of capacity), Defect.
     - Rationale: Low stock levels indicate that the resource is under significant stress. Cooperating would result in minimal payoff, and defecting allows players to capture as much value as possible before the resource collapses.

---

### **3. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, n, t, history):
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate
    coop_rate = calculate_coop_rate(history)
    
    # Determine stock level category
    if stock > 0.8 * capacity:
        stock_category = "high"
    elif 0.4 * capacity < stock <= 0.8 * capacity:
        stock_category = "medium"
    else:
        stock_category = "low"
    
    # Calculate growth potential
    remaining_stock = stock - total_consumption
    growth_potential = 2 * remaining_stock * (1 - remaining_stock / capacity)
    
    # Decision rules
    if t == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif t >= r - 1:  # Last two rounds
        return "D"  # Defect to maximize payoff
    else:
        if stock_category == "high":
            return "C"
        elif stock_category == "medium":
            if coop_rate > 0.7:  # If most players are cooperating
                return "C"
            else:
                return "D"
        else:  # stock is low
            return "D"
```

---

### **4. Collective Mindset Alignment**

- The strategy aligns with a collective mindset of balancing self-interest with the sustainability of the common pool resource.
- By starting with cooperation and adapting based on others' behavior, players contribute to maintaining a sustainable resource while protecting themselves from exploitation.
- The focus is on long-term gains over short-term maximization, ensuring that the resource remains available for future rounds.

---

### **5. Robustness to Opponent Behaviors**

- The strategy is robust because it dynamically adapts to changes in opponents' behavior.
- If opponents cooperate, the strategy continues to cooperate, fostering a cooperative environment.
- If opponents defect, the strategy defects in response, preventing exploitation and maximizing individual payoff.

---

### **6. Summary of Decision Rules**

1. **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage cooperation and start sustainably.
2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Cooperate if the stock is high (>80% capacity) or if most players are cooperating (coop_rate > 70%).
   - Defect if the stock is low (≤40% capacity) or if many players are defecting ( coop_rate ≤ 70%).
3. **Last Two Rounds:** Defect to maximize individual payoff in the final rounds.

---

This strategy balances self-interest with collective sustainability, adapting dynamically to changes in opponents' behavior and resource levels. It is designed to perform well in tournaments against a wide range of opponent strategies, ensuring both individual success and sustainable resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_47 = '''
To address the problem, we'll implement a strategy that balances immediate payoffs with future considerations. The approach uses an adaptive threshold based on the current round number, encouraging cooperation when the resource is abundant and switching to defection as the game progresses or the resource depletes.

**Strategy Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to maintain the resource.
2. **Threshold Calculation:** Dynamically adjust the threshold for cooperation based on how far into the game we are. The threshold decreases linearly from 80% of capacity in the first round to 50% in the final round, allowing more defection as the game progresses.
3. **Action Decision:** If the current stock is above the calculated threshold, cooperate; otherwise, defect. In the last few rounds, always defect to maximize immediate gains.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, capacity):
    if total_rounds == 0:
        return 'C'  # Edge case, though unlikely
    
    # Calculate progress through the game (0 for first round, 1 for last)
    progress = (round_number - 1) / (total_rounds - 1) if total_rounds > 1 else 0
    threshold = 0.8 - progress * 0.3  # Threshold decreases from 80% to 50%
    
    # In the last few rounds, always defect regardless of stock
    if round_number >= total_rounds - 2:
        return 'D'
    
    if current_stock >= threshold * capacity:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Answer:**

To implement this strategy effectively, use the following decision rule:

If it's one of the last two rounds or the current stock is below a dynamically adjusted threshold (starting at 80% and decreasing to 50%), defect; otherwise, cooperate.

The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Defect if in last two rounds or current stock < dynamically decreasing threshold; else cooperate}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_48 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer**

The optimal strategy for managing the common pool resource involves balancing immediate gains with sustainability. Here's how to approach it:

1. **Assess Current Stock Level**: Each player observes the current stock level of the common pool.

2. **Determine Threshold**: Establish a threshold at half of the capacity (50%). This point is chosen because it allows for maximum regrowth when all players cooperate, ensuring sustainability.

3. **Decision Rule**:
   - **Cooperate if Current Stock > 50% Capacity**: By cooperating, players contribute to maintaining the stock level, enabling growth and sustainable future payoffs.
   - **Defect if Current Stock ≤ 50% Capacity**: If the stock is low or has dropped below half capacity, defecting allows players to capture remaining resources before potential collapse.

4. **Rationale**:
   - Cooperating when the stock is high ensures that after consumption, enough remains to regrow sustainably.
   - Defecting when the stock is low prevents over-depletion and allows capturing whatever resources remain, preventing a total collapse where future payoffs would be zero.

5. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - **High Stock (e.g., 100)**: All players cooperate, leading to moderate consumption and maximum regrowth, maintaining the stock.
   - **Moderate Stock (e.g., 62.5)**: Cooperating allows partial consumption with enough left for significant growth.
   - **Low Stock (e.g., 34.375)**: Defecting captures remaining resources, preventing further decline.

**Final Answer**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate when the current stock of the common pool exceeds half of its capacity and defect otherwise. This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring that the resource remains viable for future rounds.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock > 50% of capacity; else, Defect}}

**Final Answer**

Here is the strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game:

---

### **Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment**

This strategy focuses on maintaining a balance between cooperation and defecting, adapting based on stock health, past payoffs, and opponents' actions.

#### **Decision Rules**

1. **First Round (t=1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Justification: Starting with cooperation helps maintain a healthy stock level, encouraging others to cooperate as well.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
   Players decide whether to Cooperate or Defect based on the following factors:

   - **Stock Health Check:**
     - Calculate the current stock as a percentage of capacity.
     - If `stock >= 75% * capacity`:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - Justification: High stock indicates sustainable resources; cooperation maintains this balance.
     - Else if `50% * capacity <= stock < 75% * capacity`:
       - **Action:** Cooperate, but monitor opponents' actions for potential punishment in future rounds.
         - Justification: Moderate stock suggests cautious cooperation while preparing to respond to defection.
     - If `stock < 50% * capacity`:
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - Justification: Low stock indicates over-depletion; defecting maximizes immediate gain before potential collapse.

   - **Past Payoff Analysis:**
     - Calculate the average payoff per round for cooperation vs. defection.
     - If past payoffs from cooperating are significantly lower than defecting:
       - **Action:** Defect this round to signal dissatisfaction with others' behavior.
         - Justification: Encourages others to cooperate in future rounds to avoid punishment.

   - **Opponents' Actions (Punishment Mechanism):**
     - If more than 50% of players defected in the previous round:
       - **Action:** Defect this round.
         - Justification: Punish defection by reducing others' payoffs and signaling disapproval.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate or follow the Stock Health Check.

3. **Last Round (t = r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Justification: Since there's no future payoff, defecting maximizes immediate gain regardless of stock level.

#### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent and encourage others to follow suit.

- **Last Round:**
  - Always Defect to maximize individual payoff since future rounds are irrelevant.

- **Low Stock Levels (stock < capacity/2):**
  - Switch to defecting to prevent further over-depletion and signal the need for change in behavior.

#### **Collective Mindset Alignment**

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset of:

1. **Sustainability:**
   - Players cooperate when resources are abundant, ensuring long-term benefits for all.
   
2. **Punishment:**
   - When cooperation is not reciprocated (e.g., others defect), players switch to defecting to incentivize better behavior in future rounds.

3. **Adaptability:**
   - The strategy adapts dynamically based on the current state of the game and past interactions, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

#### **Pseudocode**

```python
def decide_action(player_i, history, stock, capacity):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    t = current_round()

    if t == 1:
        return 'C'  # First round: Cooperate

    elif t == r:
        return 'D'  # Last round: Defect

    else:
        # Check stock health
        stock_health = (stock / capacity) * 100

        # Calculate past payoffs for C and D
        payoff_C = sum([history[t][player_i] for t in history if history[t][player_i].action == 'C']) / len([t for t in history if history[t][player_i].action == 'C'])
        payoff_D = sum([history[t][player_i] for t in history if history[t][player_i].action == 'D']) / len([t for t in history if history[t][player_i].action == 'D'])

        # Determine opponents' actions in the previous round
        prev_actions = [history[t-1][i] for i in range(n)]
        percent_defected_prev = sum(1 for a in prev_actions if a == 'D') / n

```

### **Explanation**

- The strategy starts by Cooperating to establish a cooperative baseline.
- It adapts based on the current stock level, past payoffs, and opponents' actions.
- Punishes defection by defecting in response when more than half of players have defected previously.
- Maximizes immediate gains in the last round by defecting.

This approach balances individual self-interest with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation while deterring excessive defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_50 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative Strategy (ACS)

**Objective:** To maximize long-term payoffs by maintaining sustainable consumption of the common pool resource through adaptive cooperation and controlled defection.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Rationale: Start with full cooperation to establish a stable stock level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1:** Monitor historical cooperation rate from previous rounds.
   - **Step 2:** Check current stock level against predefined thresholds:
     - **High Stock Threshold (HST):** Stock ≥ capacity * 0.8
     - **Low Stock Threshold (LST):** Stock ≤ capacity * 0.3
   - **Step 3:**
     - If historical cooperation rate > 75% and stock is above HST:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Else if historical cooperation rate < 50% or stock drops below LST:
       - **Action:** Defect (punitive phase)
     - Else:
       - Maintain current strategy based on previous round's action.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Rationale: Ensure sustainability for potential future rounds, though in this case, it reinforces the cooperative mindset without penalizing for endgame effects.

---

### **Adaptation and Punishment Mechanism:**

- **Punitive Phase:**
  - If defection is detected (cooperation rate < 50%) or stock falls below LST:
    - Defect for up to 3 consecutive rounds to signal the need for change.
  - After punitive phase, reassess cooperation rate and stock level.

- **Forgiveness:**
  - If during punitive phase, cooperation rate rebounds above 60% and stock rises above HST:
    - Revert to Cooperate in subsequent rounds.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent and maximize initial payoff without depleting resources.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Cooperate to maintain sustainable practices, even though it's the final round, promoting long-term resource health.

3. **Stock Depletion (Stock = 0):**
   - If stock reaches zero, defect in subsequent rounds until cooperation is re-established and stock begins to recover.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def ACS_strategy(current_round, historical_coop_rate, current_stock):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        HST = capacity * 0.8
        LST = capacity * 0.3
        
        if historical_coop_rate > 0.75 and current_stock >= HST:
            return "C"
        elif historical_coop_rate < 0.5 or current_stock <= LST:
            return "D"
        else:
            # Continue previous action
            return last_action

def update_state():
    global historical_coop_rate, last_action
    # Calculate new cooperation rate based on latest round
    # Adjust last_action based on ACS_strategy output
```

---

### **Rationale:**

- **Sustainability:** Prioritizes maintaining the stock above HST to ensure regeneration and long-term viability.
- **Adaptability:** Responds dynamically to changes in player behavior, encouraging cooperation while deterring excessive defection through punitive measures.
- **Collective Mindset:** Aligns individual actions with collective goals by balancing immediate gains against future sustainability.

This strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment while being resilient to exploitation, ensuring the common pool resource remains healthy over multiple rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_51 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Retaliation**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale:** Establish a sustainable resource base and signal the value of cooperation.

2. **Middle Rounds (Next 60% of total rounds):**
   - **Monitoring:** Track the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If the proportion of Cooperators is above 60%, continue to Cooperate.
     - If below 60%, Defect (D) to apply pressure and encourage others to cooperate again.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 20% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Allow more defection as the game nears its end, balancing immediate gains with minimal concern for future consequences.
   - **Rationale:** Capitalize on remaining resources without over-depleting them, considering the game will soon conclude.

4. **Stock Health Check:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level relative to capacity.
   - If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, prioritize Cooperating in the next round(s) to rebuild it, regardless of past cooperation rates.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Increase defection as there's no future payoff beyond these rounds.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```
Initialize: cooperate in the first round

for each round from 1 to r:
    if current_round is initial rounds (first 20%):
        action = C
    else:
        calculate proportion_coop_prev_round
        check stock_level
        
        if stock_level < 50% of capacity:
            action = C
        elif proportion_coop_prev_round > 60%:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D

    # Update history for next round's decision
    record_action(action)
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to collective behavior and resource levels, encouraging cooperation while applying pressure when defection becomes prevalent.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_52 = '''
To address the problem, we need a strategy that balances between maintaining sustainable consumption and maximizing immediate gains, especially towards the end of the game. The strategy should be robust against various opponent behaviors and rely on observable state rather than specific players' strategies.

### Approach
The proposed approach is based on two main observations:
1. **Sustainability Threshold**: To maintain sustainability, it's ideal to keep the stock around half of its capacity (capacity/2). This level allows for optimal growth while preventing over-consumption.
2. **End Game Adjustment**: Near the end of the game, players might be incentivized to defect more to maximize their immediate gains, knowing that the game will end soon.

The strategy is as follows:
1. **Initial and Mid Game Rounds**:
   - Cooperate if the current stock level is above half of its capacity (capacity/2).
   - Defect otherwise.
2. **End Game Adjustment**: In the last 10% of rounds, always defect to maximize immediate payoffs.

This approach ensures that we maintain sustainable consumption levels while adapting to near-end game dynamics where maximizing gains becomes more critical.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    # Check if it's the end game (last 10% of rounds)
    if round_number > 0.9 * total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate the sustainable threshold
    capacity = history[0]['stock']  # Assuming initial stock is full capacity
    sustainable_threshold = capacity / 2
    
    # Decide based on current stock level relative to threshold
    if current_stock >= sustainable_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **End Game Handling**: The strategy switches to always defecting in the last 10% of rounds to capitalize on remaining resources without regard for future sustainability, as there are no future rounds left.
- **Sustainability Check**: By maintaining a target stock level (half of capacity), the strategy ensures that consumption remains sustainable, promoting growth and preventing resource depletion.
- **Adaptability**: The approach dynamically adjusts based on the current stock level, responding to others' behaviors without requiring explicit knowledge of their strategies.

This solution effectively balances between short-term gains and long-term sustainability, making it robust against various playing styles while adhering to observable game states.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_53 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Cooperation Strategy**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a positive baseline for stock growth.

2. **Monitor and Adapt**: Continuously observe the current stock level and the proportion of cooperative actions from all players in recent rounds.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - **Stock Threshold**: Cooperate if the current stock is above 70% of capacity.
   - **Cooperation Rate**: Require at least 50% cooperation among players in the last few rounds to continue cooperating.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Adjust thresholds dynamically based on round number, lowering the stock threshold in later rounds when future impact is less significant.

5. **Reversion Mechanism**: If high defection leads to low stock levels, revert to cooperation to aid replenishment, even if it slightly reduces immediate payoffs.

6. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%), allow a tendency towards defecting since preserving the stock is less critical.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to prevent over-depletion and encouraging cooperation when beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_54 = '''
The AC (Adaptive Cooperation) strategy is designed to balance immediate payoffs with long-term resource sustainability through a combination of cooperation and defection based on current conditions and recent behavior.

**Strategy Description:**

1. **First Round**: Always cooperate to encourage others to follow suit, setting a cooperative precedent.

2. **Middle Rounds**: 
   - If the current stock is above 70% of capacity and at least half of other players have cooperated recently, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock is low (below 70%) or more than half of recent interactions involved defection, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Last Round**: Always defect since there are no future consequences, allowing each player to maximize their final payoff.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, history):
    capacity = 100  # Replace with actual capacity value
    n = 4           # Number of players; adjust as needed
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:  # Assuming 'r' is the total number of rounds
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > 0.7 * capacity:
            recent_coop = sum(1 for action in history[-k:] if action == 'C')
            if recent_coop >= (n - 1) / 2:  # At least half of others cooperated
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            recent_defect = sum(1 for action in history[-k:] if action == 'D')
            if recent_defect > (n - 1) / 2:  # More than half defected
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
```

**Explanation of the Pseudocode:**

- **Initial Round**: Cooperates to set a cooperative tone.
- **Middle Rounds**: Adapts based on stock levels and recent interactions. Maintains cooperation when conditions are favorable and defects when necessary.
- **Final Round**: Defects to maximize individual payoff without worrying about future rounds.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adjusting dynamically to changing conditions and the behavior of other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_55 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive and robust strategy that considers the current stock level, historical cooperation rates, and game progression. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round Behavior**: Cooperate to establish a sustainable resource base.
2. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - **High Stock (Above 75% of Capacity)**: Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - **Mid-Range Stock (25%-75%)**: Adjust based on recent cooperation rates.
   - **Low Stock (Below 25%)**: Defect to prevent further depletion and signal the need for change.
3. **Recent Cooperation Rate**: Use a moving average of past cooperation rates to decide actions in mid-range stock scenarios.
4. **Endgame Adjustment**: Increase tendency to cooperate in the last few rounds to maintain resource sustainability.

### Detailed Strategy

#### 1. Initialization
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintain records of each player's actions (C/D) over previous rounds.
- **Thresholds**: Define high and low thresholds relative to capacity (e.g., high = 0.75*capacity, low = 0.25*capacity).

#### 2. Round-by-Round Decision Making

**First Round:**
- Action: Cooperate (C)
- Rationale: Preserves the resource for future rounds and encourages others to do the same.

**Subsequent Rounds:**

- **Current Stock Check**:
  - If stock > high_threshold: Cooperate.
  - If stock < low_threshold: Defect.
  - Else (mid-range): Assess recent cooperation rates.

- **Mid-Range Handling**:
  - Calculate the moving average of cooperation rates over the last k rounds (e.g., k=3).
  - If average cooperation > 70%: Cooperate.
  - Else: Defect.

**Endgame Adjustment:**
- In the final 10% of rounds, increase tendency to cooperate to prevent stock depletion and sustain growth.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
initialize historical_cooperation = []
threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity
k = 3  # Number of recent rounds considered for cooperation rate

for t in range(1, r + 1):
    if t == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock(t-1)
        if current_stock > threshold_high:
            action = 'C'
        elif current_stock < threshold_low:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            # Mid-range, check recent cooperation
            recent_coop = average(historical_cooperation[-k:])
            if recent_coop > 0.7:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'
    record_action(action)
    historical_cooperation.append(1 if action == 'C' else 0)

# For the last few rounds, adjust to prevent depletion
if t >= r - (r // 10):
    action = 'C'
```

### Edge Cases and Considerations

- **First Round**: Default cooperation to build trust.
- **Low Stock**: Defecting signals others of the crisis, potentially encouraging future cooperation.
- **Endgame**: Cooperate more to maintain stock for any potential post-game scenarios.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to both resource levels and player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_56 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we'll employ a strategy that prioritizes sustainability by monitoring the stock's health and trends. The strategy adapts based on the remaining stock level and its trajectory, encouraging cooperation when resources are plentiful and defecting when they're overused.

### Strategy: Adaptive Stock-Based Cooperation (ASBC)

**1. Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Allow the stock to remain high, encouraging others to cooperate as well.

**2. Monitor Stock Trends:**
   - Track the stock level over a window of past rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds) to determine if it's increasing, decreasing, or stable.
   - Calculate the average change in stock to smooth out short-term fluctuations.

**3. Decision Rule Based on Stock Trend and Level:**
   - **Cooperate Conditions:**
     - If the stock is above a dynamic threshold (initially 80% of capacity) and increasing or stable.
   - **Defect Conditions:**
     - If the stock falls below the threshold or shows a significant decrease over time.

**4. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Adjust the threshold based on remaining rounds, becoming more lenient in later stages to maximize immediate payoff without reckless depletion.

**5. Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate with no history.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 3):** Cooperate only if stock is above a high threshold (90% of capacity). Otherwise, defect to maximize payoff.

### Summary:

The ASBC strategy emphasizes sustainability by responding to the stock's health. It encourages cooperation when resources are abundant and switches to defection when overuse threatens depletion. This adaptive approach balances immediate gains with long-term resource preservation, ensuring robust performance across varying game dynamics.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_57 = '''
The proposed strategy is designed to balance cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection to maximize immediate gains when necessary. Here's a structured outline of the strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Conditional Cooperation (ACC)

1. **Initial Round Decision**:
   - Cooperate in the first round to encourage others to maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Recent Behavior**: Examine the number of defectors in the last m rounds (e.g., m=2). This provides insight into recent trends.
   - **Threshold for Defection**: If the proportion of defectors exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%), defect in the current round. Otherwise, cooperate.
   - **Stock Level Consideration**: Adjust behavior based on the current stock level relative to capacity:
     - If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., half of capacity), prioritize cooperation to sustain growth.
     - If below this threshold, consider defecting more often to maximize immediate payoff before potential crash.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - The defection threshold and stock level thresholds can be adjusted dynamically based on game parameters (n, capacity) to optimize performance across different scenarios.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Default to cooperation.
   - **Last Round**: Consider defecting to maximize immediate payoff, but weigh this against the potential collective crash if too many defect.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, capacity):
    # Initial round: cooperate
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Recent behavior analysis
    recent_rounds = min(2, len(history))
    num_defectors = sum(round_data.count('D') for round_data in history[-recent_rounds:])
    prop_defectors = num_defectors / (n * recent_rounds)
    
    # Stock level check
    if current_stock < capacity * 0.5:
        return 'D'
    
    # Decision based on defector proportion
    if prop_defectors > 0.3:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# Example usage over rounds
action = decide_action(history, stock, capacity)
```

### Summary

This strategy encourages cooperation when the stock is healthy and others are cooperating, promoting sustainability. It adapts by defecting when necessary to prevent exploitation or in response to low stock levels, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term resource management. The approach is robust, dynamically adjusting thresholds based on game parameters and recent behavior, making it effective against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_58 = '''
To address the problem of ensuring sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a strategy where each player's decision is based on the current stock level relative to predefined thresholds. Here's the step-by-step explanation and solution:

### Step 1: Define Thresholds
- **T_high (Upper Threshold):** Set at 80% of capacity. Players will Cooperate when the stock exceeds this threshold.
- **T_low (Lower Threshold):** Although not explicitly required, recognizing that below T_high might still sustain cooperation with some adjustments.

### Step 2: Decision Rule
Each player independently decides to:
- **Cooperate** if the current stock is above T_high (80% of capacity).
- **Defect** otherwise.

### Step 3: Strategy Implementation
By following this rule, players ensure that as long as the resource remains sufficiently abundant (above 80%), cooperation continues, maintaining the equilibrium. If the stock drops below this threshold due to Defectors, others switch to Defecting, potentially leading to rapid depletion but allowing adaptation based on the new state.

### Solution Code
While the strategy is conceptual and doesn't require code for implementation, a simplified example in pseudocode could illustrate how players make decisions:

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, capacity):
    T_high = 0.8 * capacity
    if stock_level > T_high:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"
```

### Explanation
- **Sustainability:** When the stock is above 80%, all players Cooperate, ensuring the resource replenishes each cycle.
- **Adaptation:** If Defectors cause the stock to drop below 80%, others switch to Defecting, maximizing immediate gains while acknowledging potential resource collapse.

This approach balances individual payoff maximization with sustainability efforts, providing a robust strategy under varying conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_59 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a shared resource while avoiding its depletion, we can employ a strategic approach that balances cooperation with protective measures against over-consumption. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the proposed strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round. This establishes a baseline of trust and sustainability.

2. **Monitor Consumption**: For each subsequent round, monitor the total consumption from the previous round. This involves tracking how much of the resource was used collectively.

3. **Threshold Check**: Determine if the total consumption in the last round exceeded half of the current stock at the start of that round. The rationale is that consuming more than half risks depleting the resource faster and prevents sustainable growth.

4. **Decision to Defect or Cooperate**:
   - If the total consumption was greater than half the current stock, switch to defecting in the next round. This action serves as a safeguard against over-consumption, signaling others to adjust their behavior.
   - If consumption was within acceptable limits (i.e., ≤ half the stock), continue cooperating to maintain resource levels and encourage collective sustainability.

5. **Adaptation**: While this strategy provides a basic framework, it's important for players to remain adaptable. Continuous monitoring and adjustments based on collective behavior can enhance effectiveness.

**Answer**:

The proposed strategy is designed to balance cooperation with protective measures against over-consumption, aiming to sustain the resource. The step-by-step approach is as follows:

1. **Cooperate Initially**: Start with cooperation in the first round to build trust.

2. **Monitor and Evaluate Consumption**: After each round, assess whether total consumption exceeded half of the current stock at the start of that round.

3. **Adjust Behavior Based on Threshold**:
   - If consumption was excessive (greater than half), defect in the next round to signal others.
   - If within limits, continue cooperating to maintain sustainability.

This strategy helps prevent resource depletion while encouraging collective responsibility. The final answer is:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; defect if previous total consumption exceeded half of the current stock, otherwise cooperate.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_60 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Retaliation**

The strategy is designed to promote sustainability by initially cooperating and adapting based on previous rounds' behavior and the current stock level. It aims to balance immediate gains with future sustainability.

---

### **Decision Rules**
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and maintain higher stock levels for future rounds.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** 
   - Calculate the proportion of players who Defected in the previous round (`defectors_prev`).
   - Check if `defectors_prev` exceeds 30% or if the current stock is below 60% of capacity.
     - If either condition is met, switch to Defecting to reduce consumption and encourage others to cooperate again.
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating.

### **Handling Edge Cases**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20% of total rounds):** Prioritize immediate payoff by Defecting more to maximize individual gain in the final stages.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below 60% of capacity, switch to Cooperating to allow regrowth and prevent resource collapse.

### **Collective Mindset**
The strategy emphasizes collective sustainability while allowing for adaptation. Players prioritize cooperation unless excessive defection or low stock levels threaten future viability.

---

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decision(current_round, total_rounds, n, capacity, stock_history, actions_history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    previous_defectors = sum(1 for action in actions_history[-1] if action == 'D')
    defectors_prev = previous_defectors / n
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    
    # Check triggers to defect
    trigger_defect = False
    if defectors_prev > 0.3:
        trigger_defect = True
    if current_stock < 0.6 * capacity:
        trigger_defect = True
    
    # Last few rounds: prioritize immediate payoff
    if current_round >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 5):
        return 'D'
    
    return 'D' if trigger_defect else 'C'
```

---

This strategy balances cooperation for sustainability with adaptive measures to address excessive defection and low stock levels, ensuring a stable resource base while allowing for individual payoff optimization in the final rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_61 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategy that balances encouraging cooperation for sustainable resource management with individual self-interest. The strategy is adaptive and robust, designed to perform well across various scenarios without overfitting specific game parameters.

### Approach
The approach involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Stock Threshold Check**: In subsequent rounds, if the current stock level is below a critical threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), defect to prevent further depletion.
3. **Previous Round's Cooperation Rate**: If the stock level is above the threshold, check the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round. If this proportion exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., 70%), cooperate again; otherwise, defect.

This strategy aims to maintain a healthy resource level by encouraging cooperation when the group is mostly cooperating and defecting when there's insufficient cooperation or the resource is too depleted.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(previous_actions, current_stock):
    # Define thresholds (assuming capacity is 100 for simplicity; adjust as needed)
    Y = 60  # Current stock threshold to consider defecting due to low resources
    X = 0.7 # Minimum proportion of cooperation in the previous round to continue cooperating
    
    if len(previous_actions) == 0:
        return 'C'  # First round: Cooperate
        
    else:
        num_players = len(previous_actions)
        prev_coop = sum(1 for actions in previous_actions.values() if len(actions) > 0 and actions[-1] == 'C') / num_players
        
        # If current_stock is below threshold, defect to prevent further depletion
        if current_stock < Y:
            return 'D'
        
        # Otherwise, check previous cooperation rate
        elif prev_coop >= X:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, the strategy aims to set a positive tone and encourage others to follow suit.
- **Stock Threshold Check**: The critical threshold ensures that if the resource is too depleted, players switch to defecting to prevent further loss. This helps in resetting dynamics or signaling the need for change.
- **Previous Round's Cooperation Rate**: By evaluating the previous round's cooperation rate, the strategy decides whether continuing to cooperate will maintain or improve the resource level. If enough players cooperated before and the stock is sufficient, it continues to cooperate; otherwise, it defects.

This approach provides a balance between group sustainability and individual rationality, making it effective in various game scenarios.

The strategy for maintaining and managing the resource involves balancing cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and the number of remaining rounds. Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same, fostering a cooperative environment that preserves the resource for future rounds.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - **Cooperate Condition**: If the current stock is above 80% of capacity and there are more than a certain number of rounds remaining (e.g., 5), continue Cooperating. This helps maintain a stable resource level.
   - **Defect Conditions**:
     - If the current stock drops below 60% of capacity, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.
     - In the last few rounds (when there are fewer than, say, 5 rounds left), defect regardless of the stock level since preserving it offers no future benefit.

3. **Smooth Transition and Trend Monitoring**: Instead of reacting solely to the current stock level, consider trends over time. Use a moving average or monitor whether the stock is consistently increasing, decreasing, or stable to make more informed decisions.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - In the first round, Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
   - In the last few rounds, defect aggressively since there are no future payoffs to consider.
   - If the stock reaches 0 or is very low, obviously Defect as there's nothing left to preserve.

5. **Collective Adaptation**: Players should infer others' likely actions based on historical trends and adjust their behavior collectively. High cooperation rates encourage continued cooperation, while significant defection may necessitate a switch to defecting to avoid being exploited.

This strategy balances the need for resource preservation with the practical considerations of finite rounds and potential exploitation, aiming for mutual benefit through adaptive behavior.

To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a common-pool resource scenario, we propose a strategic approach based on threshold-based cooperation and defection. Here's the step-by-step explanation and answer:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to maintain the resource at a sustainable level.

2. **Threshold-Based Strategy**:
    - **Upper Threshold (80% of capacity)**: If the current stock is above 80%, Defect. This allows taking advantage of abundant resources while minimizing immediate harm.
    - **Middle Threshold (60% of capacity)**: Between 60% and 80%, Cooperate to preserve the resource for future rounds.
    - **Lower Threshold (50% of capacity)**: Below 50%, Cooperate more aggressively to allow the stock to regrow.

3. **Adjustment Based on Recent Actions**: Monitor others' actions over recent rounds. If a majority have Cooperated, continue Cooperating to encourage mutual sustainability. If most have Defected, consider switching to Defecting but only if the current stock is above 50% to prevent further depletion.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Continuously adjust your strategy based on changes in the stock level and others' behaviors to maintain a balance between immediate gains and long-term resource health.

By following this structured approach, individuals can contribute to sustaining the common-pool resource while still pursuing their self-interest in a manner that prevents rapid depletion.

**Final Answer**

To sustainably manage the resource while balancing self-interest, each player should:

- Cooperate when the stock is below 80% of capacity.
- Defect when the stock exceeds 80%, taking advantage of abundance.
- Monitor others' actions; if most cooperate, continue doing so to foster mutual sustainability.

Thus, the strategy is encapsulated as:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when stock ≤ 80%; otherwise defect, while considering recent cooperation trends.}}$

description_COLLECTIVE_64 = '''
To address the problem of managing a common pool resource sustainably while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a dynamic strategy that adapts based on observed trends in the resource level. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Begin by Cooperating to establish a baseline and observe others' behavior.

2. **Mid-Game Adaptation:**
   - Track the stock level over recent rounds using a moving average.
   - If the average stock is above 60% of capacity, continue Cooperating as it's sustainable.
   - If below, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion and maximize immediate gains.

3. **Late-Game Adjustment:**
   - In the last 20% of rounds, prioritize defecting to capitalize on immediate payoffs without worrying about long-term sustainability.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Use a moving average with exponential weighting to give more importance to recent stock levels.
   - Adjust the threshold (e.g., 60%) based on observed growth rates and depletion trends.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, previous_stock_levels):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    window_size = min(5, round_number - 1)  # Adjust as needed
    recent_stocks = previous_stock_levels[-window_size:]
    
    # Calculate moving average with exponential weights
    weights = [0.5**i for i in range(len(recent_stocks))]
    total_weight = sum(weights)
    weighted_avg = sum(s * w for s, w in zip(recent_stocks, reversed(weights))) / total_weight
    
    capacity = previous_stock_levels[0]  # Assuming initial stock is at capacity
    threshold = capacity * 0.6  # Adjust threshold as needed
    
    if weighted_avg > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Check if in the last few rounds
        if round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 5):
            return 'D'  # Defect more in late game
        else:
            return 'D' if random.random() < 0.7 else 'C'
```

### Key Considerations

- **Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold can be fine-tuned based on empirical results or specific problem constraints.
- **Moving Average Window:** Adjust the window size to balance responsiveness with stability in decisions.
- **Late Game Focus:** Prioritizing defecting in the final rounds helps maximize immediate payoffs, though this may vary depending on remaining rounds.

This strategy dynamically balances between cooperation for sustainability and defection for immediate gains, adapting based on observed trends in resource levels.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_65 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Threshold-Based Cooperation**

1. **Initial Round**: Start by Cooperating (C) in the first round to establish a baseline of sustainability.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation**:
   - After each round, assess the current stock level and its trend relative to capacity.
   - Use two thresholds:
     - **High Threshold (e.g., 80% of Capacity)**: Continue Cooperating if the stock is above this level or stable.
     - **Low Threshold (e.g., 60% of Capacity)**: Switch to Defecting (D) if the stock falls below this threshold, signaling others and preventing further depletion.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - If the stock is decreasing despite cooperation, start defecting to encourage others to reduce consumption.
   - After defecting, monitor the stock's response. If it recovers, revert to Cooperating; otherwise, continue defecting for a few rounds to strengthen the signal.

4. **Trend Analysis**: Use past trends (e.g., moving average of stock levels) to inform decisions. A downward trend may warrant Defecting, while an upward trend supports Cooperating.

5. **Robustness**: The strategy is designed to be robust against varying opponent behaviors, relying on observable game state and history without requiring communication or coordination.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
for each round in 1..r:
    if current_stock > high_threshold (e.g., 0.8 * capacity):
        action = C
    elif current_stock < low_threshold (e.g., 0.6 * capacity):
        action = D
    else:
        # Determine based on trend
        if stock_increasing_over_time():
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    play_action(action)
```

**Explanation**: This strategy balances cooperation for sustainability with defection as a corrective measure when the resource is overexploited. It dynamically adapts to maintain resource levels, encouraging collective responsibility without communication.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_66 = '''
To design an effective and adaptive strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance cooperation with defecting based on the current state of the stock and the historical cooperation rates of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage sustainable use of the resource.
2. **Adaptive Behavior:** In subsequent rounds, decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the cooperation rate from previous rounds and the current stock level.
3. **Defection in Decline:** If many players are defecting (cooperation rate below a threshold) or the stock is low, switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoff.
4. **Final Round Defection:** In the last round, defect regardless of other factors since there's no future impact.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to encourage a sustainable resource pool and observe others' actions in subsequent rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the cooperation rate from previous rounds.
     - Cooperation Rate = (Number of Cooperators in last round) / n
   - **Step 2:** Determine if current stock is above a sustainable threshold (e.g., capacity/2).
     - Sustainable Threshold = capacity * 0.5
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If Cooperation Rate > 60% and Stock >= Sustainable Threshold:
       - Cooperate to maintain the resource pool.
     - Else:
       - Defect to maximize immediate payoff, especially if others are not cooperating.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Rationale:** No future rounds, so defect for maximum payoff regardless of other factors.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, previous_rounds_actions, current_stock, n, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate cooperation rate from last round
        prev_coop = sum(1 for action in previous_rounds_actions[-1] if action == 'C')
        coop_rate = prev_coop / n
        
        sustainable_threshold = capacity * 0.5
        
        if coop_rate > 0.6 and current_stock >= sustainable_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages sustainability by starting with cooperation.
- **Adaptive Behavior:** Adjusts based on others' actions, promoting cooperation when feasible and defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion.
- **Final Round Defection:** Maximizes payoff in the last round without worrying about future impacts.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to different scenarios and opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_67 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Cooperate to encourage a cooperative environment and maintain a high stock level.

2. **Monitor Behavior:**
   - Track the number of players defecting each round to assess overall cooperation trends.

3. **Adjust Strategy Based on Cooperation Rate:**
   - If most players (≥70%) cooperate, continue to cooperate.
   - If a significant portion (e.g., >30%) defect, start increasing defection frequency to prevent exploitation.

4. **Stock Thresholds:**
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 60% of capacity.
   - Defect if the stock falls below 40% to maximize immediate gain before potential depletion.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 2 rounds):** Increase defection likelihood to capitalize on possible resource availability, considering others might defect as well.

6. **Mitigating Flaws:**
   - Occasionally cooperate even if others defect, aiming to reset cooperation and prevent cycles of mutual defection.
   - Use gradual increases in defection based on stock decrease to avoid sudden depletions.

This strategy balances maintaining cooperation when beneficial with defecting when necessary, adapting to others' actions and current stock levels without relying on specific coordination. It aims to maximize payoffs while sustaining the resource pool for future rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_68 = '''
**Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (ACT)**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over all rounds by balancing immediate exploitation with resource preservation.

**Components:**

1. **Initial Round Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players cooperate to establish a cooperative environment and prevent early depletion of the common pool.

2. **Sustainable Stock Threshold (SST):**
   - Define SST as 60% of capacity. This level ensures that resource recovery is feasible without drastic reductions in payoffs.

3. **Stock Level-Based Action:**
   - **Above SST:** Players cooperate to maintain a stable stock, allowing growth and sustainable use.
   - **Below SST:** Players defect cautiously. If the majority cooperated last round, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect to encourage others to preserve resources.

4. **Tit-for-Tat Component:**
   - After the first round, each player's action is based on the majority action of all players in the previous round.
     - If most players cooperated, continue cooperation.
     - If a significant number defected, defect in this round to signal disapproval and encourage future cooperation.

5. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds (rounded up), enforce cooperation to maximize sustainable payoff as there's limited time for resource recovery.

**Decision Rules:**

- **If current stock > SST:**
  - Cooperate, regardless of previous actions, to maintain sustainability and encourage mutual benefits.

- **If current stock ≤ SST:**
  - Defect if more than half the players defected in the last round.
  - Cooperate otherwise, signaling willingness to preserve resources.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to set a cooperative precedent.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Shift towards cooperation to sustain payoffs without depletion risks.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Maintain cooperation to prevent unnecessary depletion and ensure growth opportunities.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Determine SST as 0.6 * capacity.
   - Start with cooperation in the first round.

2. **Each Round (from 2nd onwards):**
   a. Check if current stock > SST:
      - Cooperate.
   b. Else, check majority action from last round:
      - If more than half cooperated, cooperate.
      - Otherwise, defect to incentivize future cooperation.

3. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - In the final 10% of rounds, enforce cooperation regardless of previous actions.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
function decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if stock_level > SST:
            return 'C'
        else:
            last_round_actions = history[-1]
            majority_coop = sum(last_round_actions) / len(last_round_actions) > 0.5
            if majority_coop:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
    # For final rounds, override with cooperation
    if round_number in last_10_percent:
        return 'C'
```

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages others to preserve resources early on.
- **Stock-Based Decisions:** Balances exploitation and preservation based on current resource levels.
- **Tit-for-Tat Mechanism:** Rewards cooperation and punishes defection, promoting mutual interest in sustainability.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment:** Ensures maximum payoff by maintaining cooperation when future rounds are limited.

This strategy adaptively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging collective cooperation while deterring exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_69 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining sustainability in a common resource game while preventing over-exploitation, we propose a strategic approach that balances cooperation with responsive measures against over-consumption. This strategy ensures long-term benefits by encouraging sustainable use unless disrupted by excessive consumption.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start each round by Cooperating to sustain the resource at its maximum level, ensuring steady payoffs for all players.

2. **Monitor Consumption:** After each round, evaluate the total consumption relative to the initial stock of that round. Specifically, check if the total consumption exceeded half of the initial stock (i.e., C/S > 0.5).

3. **Responsive Defection:** If over-consumption (C/S > 0.5) is detected in any round, switch to Defecting in subsequent rounds. This action aims to maximize immediate gains while signaling不满 at unsustainable practices.

4. **Reversion to Cooperation:** Continue Cooperating only if previous rounds consistently show sustainable consumption (C/S ≤ 0.5). If over-consumption recurs, repeat the defection phase to prevent resource depletion.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to initially Cooperate and maintain sustainability. Upon detecting over-consumption in any round, players should Defect in subsequent rounds to deter further unsustainable practices and maximize immediate payoffs. This approach balances long-term benefits with necessary responsiveness to preserve the resource.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate until over-consumption occurs; then defect in subsequent rounds}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_70 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategy that encourages cooperation while safeguarding against defection and resource depletion. The strategy is designed as follows:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round**: Begin by Cooperating to foster a cooperative environment.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Assess Previous Cooperation**: Determine the proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round(s).
   - **Stock Health Check**: Evaluate if the current stock level is above a sustainable threshold (e.g., 75% capacity).
   - **Decision Making**:
     - If most players Cooperated and the stock is healthy, continue Cooperating.
     - If cooperation levels drop below a threshold or the stock is at risk, switch to Defecting as a punitive measure.
3. **Adaptation**: Adjust thresholds dynamically based on others' actions and stock responses.
4. **Reset Periods**: After periods of Defection, reintroduce Cooperation attempts to encourage positive behavior.

### Detailed Strategy

1. **First Round**:
   - Action: Cooperate
   - Rationale: Set a cooperative tone to encourage others.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round t ≥ 2)**:
   a. **Count Previous Cooperation**:
      - Calculate the number of players who Cooperated in round t-1.
      - If more than half Cooperated and the stock was above 75% capacity, continue Cooperating.

   b. **Stock Check**:
      - If the stock is below a critical level (e.g., 30% capacity), start Defecting aggressively to prevent collapse.

   c. **Recent Trends**:
      - Consider recent rounds (last k rounds) to assess if more than 60% of actions were Defectors.
      - If so, switch to Defecting for the next few rounds.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - After several rounds of Defection, try Cooperating again to test others' responsiveness.
   - Adjust cooperation thresholds based on how the stock responds and others' behavior trends.

4. **Endgame (Last Few Rounds)**:
   - Balance between defecting for remaining resources and maintaining cooperation to sustain higher payoffs longer.

### Conclusion

This strategy aims to promote sustainable cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while monitoring resource health to prevent collapse. It balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability through adaptive behavior and periodic resets to encourage positive actions from others.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_71 = '''
To address the problem of promoting cooperation while adapting to defection in a repeated game scenario, we can outline a strategic approach that balances individual gain with collective sustainability. The strategy takes into account the current stock level, historical cooperation rates among players, and adjusts actions accordingly.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to establish a foundation for sustainability.
2. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - **High Stock (Above 90% Capacity)**: Continue Cooperating to maintain high stock levels.
   - **Moderate Stock (70%-90% Capacity)**: Assess cooperation rates from the previous rounds. If more than 60% of players Cooperated, continue Cooperating; otherwise, switch to Defecting.
   - **Low Stock (Below 70% Capacity)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff as sustainability is at risk.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, previous_actions):
    if current_stock == 0:
        return 'D'
    
    # Determine thresholds based on parameters
    critical_high = 0.9 * capacity
    critical_low = 0.7 * capacity
    
    t = len(previous_actions) + 1
    if t == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate proportion of Cooperators in the last round
    last_round_actions = previous_actions[-1]
    num_coop_last_round = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    total_players = len(last_round_actions)
    proportion_coop_last_round = num_coop_last_round / total_players
    
    # Decision logic based on current stock and cooperation rate
    if current_stock >= critical_high:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock > critical_low:
        if proportion_coop_last_round >= 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with a Cooperate action in the first round to encourage sustainability.
2. **High Stock Levels (Above 90% Capacity)**: When the stock is healthy and high, continuing to Cooperate helps maintain this state, ensuring future rounds also benefit from stable resources.
3. **Moderate Stock Levels (70%-90% Capacity)**: Here, the strategy evaluates recent cooperation rates. If a significant majority of players Cooperated in the last round, it reinforces Cooperation to sustain the resource. Conversely, if Cooperation is low, defecting becomes advantageous to maximize individual payoff while others' defection may indicate an unsustainable trend.
4. **Low Stock Levels (Below 70% Capacity)**: When resources are critically low, defecting is chosen to secure immediate gains before potential collapse.

This approach dynamically adapts based on current conditions and historical behaviors, balancing the need for cooperation with the reality of possible defection to optimize both individual and collective outcomes over time.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_72 = '''
The optimal strategy for maintaining a sustainable balance between consumption and growth is to cooperate when the current stock exceeds half of its maximum capacity. This ensures that each round can sustainably support cooperation without depleting resources beyond recovery.

**Answer:**

Cooperate if the current stock is greater than half of the capacity, otherwise defect.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S > \frac{\text{Capacity}}{2}, \text{ else Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_73 = '''
The proposed collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a structured outline of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
- **Objective:** Maximize individual payoffs while maintaining a sustainable resource level through adaptive cooperation and defection based on game dynamics.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - All players start by Cooperating to establish a high initial stock level, promoting growth in subsequent rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Each player evaluates two factors from the previous round:
     - **Cooperation Rate:** The proportion of players who Cooperated.
     - **Stock Level:** Current stock relative to capacity.

3. **Cooperation Thresholds:**
   - If both the cooperation rate exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 60%) and the current stock is above half of its capacity, players continue to Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, players Defect to either prevent exploitation or manage scarce resources.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(current_round, history, stock, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate cooperation rate in the previous round
        prev_coop_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C')
        coop_rate = prev_coop_count / len(history[-1])
        
        # Determine thresholds
        stock_threshold = capacity * 0.5
        coop_threshold = 0.6
        
        if stock > stock_threshold and coop_rate > coop_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Stock Threshold:** Set at half the capacity to ensure sufficient resources for growth and sustain cooperation.
- **Cooperation Rate Threshold:** 60% ensures a majority are cooperating, promoting collective stability.

This strategy adapts dynamically, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse or exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_74 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoff while ensuring sustainable use of the common pool resource through adaptive cooperation, considering both current stock levels and historical behavior of other players.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Cooperate When Safe (High Stock Levels):**
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above 80% of capacity.
   - Rationale: High stock ensures sustainability and sufficient resource for growth, allowing all players to benefit equally without over-depletion.

2. **Defect When Critical (Low Stock Levels):**
   - Defect if the current stock drops below 50% of capacity.
   - Rationale: Low stock indicates potential collapse; defecting allows players to salvage remaining resources before irreversible depletion.

3. **Adapt Based on Others' Behavior:**
   - Cooperate if at least 70% of other players cooperated in the previous round, adjusting thresholds dynamically based on observed cooperation rates.
   - Defect if fewer than 30% of others cooperate, signaling widespread exploitation that necessitates individual gain.

4. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a cooperative tone and encourage others to do the same.
   - **Last Two Rounds (R-1 and R):** Defect in all rounds to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future depletion, given no subsequent rounds.

---

### **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initial Round Strategy:**
   - Cooperate unconditionally in the first round to set a cooperative precedent.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation:**
   - After each round, calculate the proportion of players who cooperated.
   - Adjust cooperation thresholds dynamically based on this proportion:
     - If cooperation rate > 70%, maintain or increase cooperation.
     - If cooperation rate < 30%, shift towards defecting to prevent exploitation.

3. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - Use fixed thresholds (80% for cooperate, 50% for defect) as primary decision criteria.
   - Apply a sliding scale between these thresholds based on observed stock trends and historical cooperation rates.

4. **Final Rounds Strategy:**
   - In the last two rounds, default to defecting to maximize individual payoffs without regard for future resource sustainability.

---

### **Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, round_number, total_rounds, other_players_actions):
    capacity = game_parameters.capacity
    cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(other_players_actions)
    
    # Edge cases handling
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif total_rounds - round_number <= 1:
        return 'D'
    
    # Determine action based on stock level and cooperation rate
    if stock_level > capacity * 0.8:
        return 'C'
    elif stock_level < capacity * 0.5:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if cooperation_rate >= 0.7:
            return 'C'
        elif cooperation_rate <= 0.3:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Use a sliding scale between thresholds
            threshold = capacity * (0.8 - ((capacity - stock_level) / capacity) * 0.3)
            if stock_level > threshold:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

def calculate_cooperation_rate(other_players_actions):
    total_actions = sum(1 for actions in other_players_actions.values() if len(actions) >= round_number and actions[round_number-1] == 'C')
    return total_actions / (len(other_players_actions) * 1.0)
```

---

### **Explanation:**

This strategy balances cooperation with individual gain, ensuring sustainability while adapting to others' behaviors. By using fixed thresholds for stock levels and dynamic adjustments based on historical cooperation rates, the strategy aims to maintain a cooperative equilibrium unless exploitation or critical resource levels necessitate defection. This approach is robust against various opponent strategies and ensures optimal payoff under different game conditions.

To address the problem of balancing cooperation and defection in managing a shared resource over multiple rounds, we propose an adaptive strategy that responds to observed trends in resource levels. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first round to encourage others to do the same, fostering a cooperative environment.

2. **Monitor Resource Trends**:
   - Track the stock level after each round, noting how much of the resource remains and whether it's growing or declining.
   - Calculate a moving average of the stock levels over the last few rounds (e.g., 3-5) to identify trends.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision-Making**:
   - Establish a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity) above which cooperation is sustained because it indicates a healthy, sustainable resource.
   - If the average stock level falls below this threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoff as cooperation is no longer effective.

4. **Endgame Adjustment**:
   - In the final rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds), anticipate that others will defect and adjust your strategy accordingly, switching to defection to avoid being exploited.

This strategy dynamically adapts based on observed data, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary. It balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, aiming for optimal collective payoff.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate initially, then monitor the resource's health using a threshold-based approach, and adjust behavior in the final rounds. Here's how it works:

- **First Round**: Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds**: Calculate the moving average of stock levels over recent rounds. If above 60% capacity, continue cooperation; if below, defect.
- **Final Rounds**: Switch to defection as others are likely to do the same.

This approach maximizes collective payoff while adapting to changing conditions and anticipating endgame behavior.

description_COLLECTIVE_76 = '''
To address the problem of encouraging cooperation while preventing resource collapse in a repeated game setting, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both the number of cooperating players and the current state of the shared resource. The strategy is designed to balance individual self-interest with the collective good, ensuring sustainable payoffs over multiple rounds.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Player Behavior and Resource State**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Decision:** Cooperate (C)
     - **Reasoning:** Begin with cooperation to encourage others to follow suit, maintaining high resource levels for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   a. Determine the number of players who chose to Cooperate in the previous round.
   b. Calculate the cooperation rate as `(Number of Cooperators) / n`.
   c. Check if the current stock level is above a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
   d. **Decision:**
      - If both conditions are met (`cooperation rate > X` and `stock > Y`), choose to Cooperate (C).
      - Otherwise, choose to Defect (D).

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Decision:** Defect (D)
     - **Reasoning:** Since there are no future rounds left, defecting maximizes the immediate payoff without concern for long-term consequences.

**Parameters:**

- **Cooperation Rate Threshold (X):** This threshold determines the minimum proportion of players that need to cooperate in the previous round for you to decide to cooperate. A lower threshold encourages more cooperation but risks being exploited by defectors.
- **Stock Level Threshold (Y):** This threshold ensures that cooperation is only maintained when the resource level is sufficient to sustain it and allows for growth, preventing unnecessary depletion.

**Example:**

Let's consider a scenario with 4 players (n=4) and a capacity of 100 units. The initial stock is set at 100.

- **Round 1:** All players Cooperate. Stock remains high and grows back to full capacity due to the cooperative actions.
  
- **Round 2:** Observing that all players cooperated in Round 1, and the stock level is above the threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), you decide to Cooperate again.

- **Round 3:** Suppose two players defect. The stock after consumption would be lower, but if your strategy's cooperation rate threshold is set at 40%, seeing that half of the players still cooperate might encourage you to continue cooperating in Round 4, helping to stabilize the resource.

This approach ensures that cooperation is maintained when beneficial and sustainable, while also allowing for defection when necessary to prevent exploitation or resource collapse.

**Conclusion:**

By implementing this adaptive strategy, each player can contribute to maintaining a balance between individual gains and collective resource management. The strategy encourages cooperation under favorable conditions and adapts by defecting when the resource state or cooperative behavior of others warrants it. This approach helps sustain the shared resource over multiple rounds, promoting mutual benefits for all players involved.

**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over all rounds by balancing cooperation and defection based on player behavior and stock levels.

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Start with Cooperate in the first round to encourage a sustainable resource level.

2. **Adaptive Behavior:**
   - For each subsequent round, observe the number of Defectors from the previous round.
   - If more than 20% of players Defected, switch to Defecting for the next few rounds to prevent exploitation.
   - Monitor the current stock level:
     - If above 50% of capacity, continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability.
     - If below 50%, revert to Cooperating to preserve the remaining stock.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds, switch back to Cooperating to maximize long-term gains and avoid unnecessary depletion.

**Rationale:**
- The strategy begins with Cooperation to foster a sustainable environment.
- It adapts by defecting when others exploit, preventing undue resource loss.
- By monitoring stock levels, it ensures sustainability even as the game progresses.
- Near the end, reverting to Cooperation preserves resources for all players, maximizing collective payoff.

This approach dynamically balances between rewarding Cooperation and protecting against Defection, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_78 = '''
To address the problem, we developed a strategic approach that balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability, adapting based on current conditions and historical behavior. Here's the final strategy:

**Final Answer:**

Adopt an initial cooperative stance to foster resource sustainability. Monitor the stock level and the prevalence of defection among other players in recent rounds. Switch to defection when the stock is low or when a significant number of others are defecting, ensuring short-term gains while attempting to maintain cooperation when possible. Near the end of the game, prioritize immediate payoffs by defecting.

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_79 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation and defection based on stock levels and trends. The strategy is designed to encourage mutual cooperation while adapting to potential defection.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to maintain a high stock, promoting sustainable growth and setting a positive precedent for other players.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Decision Rule:** Cooperate if the current stock is above a dynamically adjusted threshold (initially 75% of capacity) and the trend shows stable or increasing stock levels.
   - **Action:** Defect otherwise, particularly if the stock is below a critical level or showing significant depletion.

3. **Later Rounds:**
   - **Adjustment:** Gradually increase the tendency to defect as rounds approach the end (e.g., last 10% of rounds), focusing on maximizing immediate payoffs without regard for future consequences.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Use a moving average or trend analysis over recent rounds to adjust the cooperation threshold.
   - If the stock decreases significantly, lower the threshold to encourage more defecting and attempt to stabilize resource levels.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - **Last Round(s):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number):
    capacity = game.capacity
    n = game.n
    r = game.r
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate dynamic threshold based on stock trend
    recent_stock = history[-5:]  # Adjust window size as needed
    average_change = sum(stock_next - stock_curr for stock_curr, stock_next in zip(recent_stock[:-1], recent_stock[1:])) / len(recent_stock)
    
    if average_change < 0:
        threshold = max(capacity * 0.6, stock)  # Adjust thresholds as needed
    else:
        threshold = capacity * 0.75
    
    if stock > threshold and round_number <= r - (r // 10):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins by cooperating to maintain the resource, encouraging others to do the same.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** By analyzing recent stock trends, the strategy adapts its cooperation threshold. If the stock is declining, it lowers the threshold, prompting more defection to prevent further depletion.
- **Gradual Defection in Later Rounds:** As the game nears its end, players prioritize immediate payoffs by defecting, recognizing there's no future punishment for such actions.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to encourage cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_80 = '''
The strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by using adaptive cooperation and defection based on stock levels and historical behavior. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Balance Strategy (ABS)

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Starts with maximum stock, ensuring a positive precedent for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Use thresholds to decide actions:
     - If current stock > 30% of capacity: Cooperate.
     - Else: Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maintains stock health when sufficient, allowing growth; defects when stock is low to prevent further depletion.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** No future rounds, so maximize immediate payoff.

4. **Adaptation Based on Past Behavior:**
   - If previous rounds had high cooperation, continue Cooperating to sustain the resource.
   - If many Defected previously, respond by Defecting more to prevent exploitation.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, round_number, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif 2 <= round_number < r:
        threshold = 0.3 * capacity
        if stock > threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else: # final round
        return 'D'

def update_history(history, action, payoffs):
    history.append({
        'action': action,
        'payoff': sum(payoffs),
        'stock_level': current_stock()
    })
```

### Considerations and Potential Improvements

- **Threshold Adjustment:** The 30% threshold is a starting point. Adjusting it based on game parameters (n, r) could optimize outcomes.
- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Incorporate historical consumption rates to adjust thresholds dynamically for better adaptation.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** Tailor strategies for scenarios with large n or small r to account for individual impacts and limited rounds.

This strategy encourages sustainable resource management while adapting to opponents' behaviors, aiming to maximize long-term payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_81 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

**Objective:** To sustainably manage the common pool resource while maximizing individual payoffs through adaptive cooperation and defection based on dynamic thresholds.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate in the first 2-3 rounds to establish a baseline of sustainable use and observe opponents' behavior.

2. **Dynamic Threshold for Cooperation:**
   - Calculate a threshold `S_threshold` that adjusts based on the number of rounds remaining:
     ```
     S_threshold = capacity * (1 - (current_round / total_rounds) * 0.5)
     ```
     This ensures higher thresholds early on, encouraging cooperation when more rounds are left.

3. **Cooperation Decision:**
   - Cooperate if the current stock `S` is above `S_threshold` or if there are many rounds remaining to encourage long-term sustainability.
     ```
     if S > S_threshold or rounds_left > 0.6 * total_rounds:
         choose C
     ```

4. **Defection Decision:**
   - Defect if the stock is below the threshold and there are fewer rounds left, prioritizing immediate payoff to avoid future depletion.
     ```
     else:
         choose D
     ```

5. **Historical Trend Adjustment:**
   - If the historical trend shows a decreasing stock, lower the cooperation threshold to encourage defecting and prevent rapid depletion.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate to start with sustainability and observe opponents' actions.

2. **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds):**
   - Adjust `S_threshold` lower to prioritize immediate gains, as future sustainability is less critical.
     ```
     if current_round > total_rounds - 3:
         S_threshold = capacity * 0.5
     ```

3. **Stock Near Capacity:**
   - Continue Cooperating to maintain the resource and encourage others to do the same.

4. **Stock Near Depletion (e.g., below 20% of capacity):**
   - Defect more frequently to maximize immediate payoff before potential collapse.

---

### **Collective Mindset Alignment**

- **Sustainability First:** Prioritize cooperation when resources are abundant to ensure long-term availability.
- **Adaptability:** Adjust strategies dynamically based on current stock levels and remaining rounds to balance immediate gains with future sustainability.
- **Observation and Reaction:** Monitor opponents' actions; if many defect, consider defecting more to prevent personal loss.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, current_round, total_rounds):
    # Initial cooperation in the first few rounds
    if current_round <= 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate dynamic threshold based on remaining rounds
    rounds_left = total_rounds - current_round + 1
    threshold_depletion = 0.5 * (current_round / total_rounds)
    S_threshold = capacity * (1 - threshold_depletion)
    
    # Check if stock is above the threshold or many rounds left
    if current_stock > S_threshold or rounds_left > 0.6 * total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Consider historical trend
        historical_trend = calculate_historical_stock_change()
        if historical_trend < -10:  # Arbitrary threshold for decreasing trend
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'D' if current_stock <= S_threshold else 'C'

# Helper function to calculate historical trend
def calculate_historical_stock_change():
    # Implementation would track past stock levels and compute the trend
    pass
```

---

### **Summary**

The ATC strategy adapts dynamically based on the game's progression, encouraging cooperation when resources are plentiful and defecting when necessary to maximize payoffs. By balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, this strategy aims to perform well across various opponent behaviors in the tournament.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_82 = '''
The collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability. It adapts based on observed behavior and stock health without relying on coordination mechanisms.

**Strategy Overview:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to follow suit, setting a baseline for expected consumption.

2. **Monitor Consumption:** For each subsequent round, calculate the previous round's total consumption. Compare this to the expected consumption if all players had Cooperated (S_prev / 2).

3. **Detect Defectors:** If total consumption exceeds a set threshold above the expected level, it indicates potential Defectors. Switch to Defecting for a limited number of rounds as a deterrent.

4. **Return to Cooperation:** After defecting for a predetermined period or when the stock replenishes sufficiently, revert to Cooperating to promote sustainable resource management.

5. **Final Rounds Adjustment:** In the last few rounds (e.g., 20%), adjust strategy to balance current payoffs with preserving the stock, possibly leaning towards Cooperation to avoid depletion.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def collective_strategy(round_number, total_rounds, stock_history, actions_history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = initial_capacity()
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate previous round's consumption
    prev_stock = stock_history[-2]
    prev_consumption = prev_stock - stock_history[-1] + growth_calculation(prev_stock, capacity)
    
    expected_coop = prev_stock / (2 * n)  # Expected per player if all Cooperate
    total_expected = n * expected_coop
    
    # Determine if Defectors were present
    threshold = 1.2  # Adjust based on simulations
    if prev_consumption > threshold * total_expected:
        return 'D'  # Defect for a limited number of rounds
    else:
        return 'C'
    
    # Additional checks for final rounds and stock level
    if round_number > (total_rounds - 0.2 * total_rounds):
        if stock_history[-1] < capacity / 4:
            return 'C'  # Preserve stock in final rounds
    
def growth_calculation(s_remaining, capacity):
    return 2 * s_remaining * (1 - s_remaining / capacity)
```

**Key Considerations:**

- **Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold for detecting Defectors should be tuned based on simulations to avoid false positives while promptly reacting to actual Defection.

- **Stock Management:** Aim to maintain the stock around capacity/2 for optimal growth, adjusting strategies to prevent over-depletion or under-utilization.

This strategy promotes sustainability by encouraging Cooperation initially and adapting to detect and deter Defectors, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_83 = '''
To address the problem of managing a shared resource, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy is designed to encourage cooperation while allowing players to adapt based on the current state of the resource.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define a Target Stock Level:** Set a target stock level (e.g., half of the maximum capacity) as a threshold for deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect.

2. **Assess Current Stock Level:** At the beginning of each round, evaluate if the current stock is above or below the defined target.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** If the current stock is above the target, players should Cooperate to maintain sustainable use and allow for growth.
   - **Defect (D):** If the current stock is at or below the target, players should Defect to maximize their immediate payoff, recognizing that the resource may be overused.

4. **Consider Trends and Recovery:** Introduce a mechanism to reassess cooperation after a period of defecting if the stock begins to recover, preventing perpetual depletion.

5. **Adaptation Over Time:** Monitor the effectiveness of the strategy and adjust thresholds or rules as needed based on observed outcomes and player behavior patterns.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is for each player to Cooperate when the current stock exceeds half of the maximum capacity and Defect otherwise, with provisions to reassess cooperation if the resource begins to recover. This approach aims to balance immediate gains against long-term sustainability, encouraging mutual cooperation while allowing adaptation based on the resource's health.

**Answer:**

Each player should Cooperate if the current stock is above half of the maximum capacity; otherwise, they should Defect. This strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable use, promoting cooperation when possible and adapting to prevent resource depletion.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock > 0.5 × max capacity; else, Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_84 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances individual gains with the collective need to preserve the resource. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating (C) when the stock is above half of the capacity. This helps maintain sustainable payoffs and prevents rapid depletion.

2. **Defection Threshold**: Switch to defecting (D) if the stock falls below half the capacity. This action maximizes immediate gains while preventing over-depletion that could lead to long-term losses.

3. **Sustainability Check**: Each round, assess the current stock level relative to the threshold. Cooperate if above; defect if below.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always cooperate to maintain a high initial stock.
   - **Last Rounds**: Consider defecting more aggressively as future payoffs are limited, but balance this to avoid sudden stock collapse.

This strategy ensures adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors by focusing on the current state without relying on communication or coordination beyond simple rules. It promotes cooperation when sustainable and switches to defection when necessary, balancing short-term gains with long-term resource preservation.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```
for each round from 1 to r:
    if stock > capacity / 2:
        choose C
    else:
        choose D
    update stock based on all players' actions
end for
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_85 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

Our strategy aims to balance cooperation for long-term sustainability while adaptively responding to potential defection. Here's how it works:

### 1. Initial Rounds (First 2-3)
- **Action:** Cooperate
- **Rationale:** Establish a stable stock level and encourage others to follow suit, promoting sustainable resource use.

### 2. Middle Rounds
- **Monitor Metrics:**
  - **Cooperation Rate:** Average of Cooperate actions from the last x rounds (e.g., 5).
  - **Stock Level:** Current stock relative to capacity.
- **Decision Rules:**
  - If cooperation rate > 70% and stock > 60% of capacity: Cooperate.
  - Otherwise: Defect.
- **Rationale:** Sustain cooperation if others are doing so and the resource is stable. Defect if cooperation drops or the resource is at risk.

### 3. Endgame (Last 2-3 Rounds)
- **Action Consideration:** Tend towards defection to maximize payoffs, but consider current stock to avoid unnecessary depletion.
- **Rationale:** Prioritize immediate gains in final rounds, balancing against potential stock harm.

### 4. Response to Low Stock
- **If stock drops significantly below safe levels despite cooperation:**
  - Switch to a cooperative rebuild phase by temporarily reducing consumption or cooperating more aggressively.
- **Rationale:** Recover the resource for future stability if possible.

### Implementation Notes:
- Use exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) for cooperation rate to balance recent and past trends.
- Include clear triggers for transitioning between phases based on metrics.

This strategy promotes mutual cooperation while adaptively handling defection, ensuring robust performance against varying opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_86 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a strategic approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observable metrics. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first round to establish trust and promote a sustainable resource base.

2. **Adaptation Based on Previous Behavior**:
   - After the first round, assess the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - If more than two-thirds (approximately 67%) of the players cooperated last round, it indicates a willingness to maintain sustainability.

3. **Resource Check**: Evaluate the current stock level relative to its initial capacity.
   - If the stock is above 80% of its initial capacity, it suggests that the resource is healthy and can sustain cooperation.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - If both conditions are met (sufficient cooperation from others and a healthy resource), continue to cooperate in the current round.
   - Otherwise, defect to either maximize immediate payoff or prevent further depletion of the resource.

5. **Final Round Adjustment**: In the last round, switch to defection since there's no future impact to consider.

This strategy aims to foster collective sustainability while protecting against exploitation by defectors, ensuring a balance between individual gain and group welfare.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

The proposed strategy is designed to promote cooperation when it leads to sustainable resource management and switches to defection when necessary to prevent collapse or maximize immediate payoff. Here's how it works:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Count the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - Check if the current stock is above 80% of its initial capacity.
   - If more than two-thirds of players cooperated and the stock is sufficiently high, continue to cooperate.
   - Otherwise, defect to either exploit the resource or protect against further depletion.
3. **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

This approach ensures that cooperation is maintained when it's effective, while defection is used strategically to address threats of resource collapse or exploit situations where others have defected.

**Final Answer:**

The strategy balances cooperation and defection based on the previous round's behavior and current resource levels. It starts with cooperation, continues if sustainable conditions are met, and defects otherwise or in the final round. This approach is encapsulated as:

- Cooperate initially.
- Continue cooperating if >67% of players did so last round and stock >80% capacity.
- Defect otherwise or in the last round.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when sustainable; defect when necessary}}$

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Triggers**

**Objective:**  
To maximize individual payoff while maintaining a sustainable common pool resource, balancing cooperation for long-term benefits and defection when necessary.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

#### **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to maintain the resource and encourage others to do the same.

#### **Subsequent Rounds:**
- **Action:** Base decision on the historical consumption rate from previous rounds.
- **Cooperate (C) if:** The average historical per-player consumption is ≤ 1 unit (indicating cooperation).
- **Defect (D) if:** The average historical per-player consumption > 1 unit (indicating defection).

#### **Final Few Rounds:**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C) unless the remaining stock is very high, in which case defect (D).
- **Rationale:** Preserve resources for sustainability while not missing out on potential gains.

---

### **2. Monitoring and Triggers**

- **Historical Consumption Check:** Calculate the average per-player consumption from the past `k` rounds (e.g., k=3) to detect trends.
  - If average > 1 unit, defect in response.
  - If average ≤ 1 unit, cooperate.

- **Stock Threshold Check:** After each round, if the stock is below a critical level (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to cooperation regardless of past consumption to prevent collapse.

---

### **3. Edge Cases Handling**

#### **First Round:**
- Always Cooperate to set a positive example and maintain resource levels.

#### **Last Few Rounds:**
- If rounds remaining ≤ 5, defect only if stock is above a threshold (e.g., >60% capacity) to prevent excessive depletion.
- Otherwise, cooperate to sustain the resource.

---

### **4. Adaptation Mechanism**

- After defecting for `m` consecutive rounds (e.g., m=2), reassess cooperation levels.
  - If cooperation is restored, revert to Cooperate.
  - If defection persists, continue defecting but monitor stock closely.

- If stock drops below a critical level during defection periods, immediately switch to Cooperate to aid recovery.

---

### **5. Pseudocode Outline**

```pseudocode
Initialize strategy with cooperate in the first round.

For each round from 1 to r:
    If current round is 1:
        Choose C
    Else:
        Calculate historical average consumption over past k rounds
        If historical average > 1:
            Choose D for m consecutive rounds, then reassess
        Else:
            Choose C
    After action:
        Monitor stock level
        If stock < critical threshold:
            Switch to C regardless of previous decisions

Handle last few rounds (e.g., last 5):
    If stock > high_threshold:
        Choose D
    Else:
        Choose C
```

---

### **6. Rationale**

- Starting with cooperation fosters a sustainable environment.
- Using historical data detects trends in others' behavior, allowing responsive actions.
- Stock thresholds prevent resource collapse and encourage recovery.
- Adaptation ensures the strategy remains flexible to changing dynamics without prolonged cycles of defection.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability, adapting to various opponent behaviors while promoting cooperation when beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_88 = '''
The strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game is an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with defection based on the current stock level, trends over time, and the proximity to the end of the game. Here's a structured outline of the strategy:

### Decision Rules:
1. **High Stock Level (S ≥ 2/3 * Capacity):**
   - Cooperate unless it is within the last 10% of rounds.
   
2. **Moderate Stock Level (1/3 * Capacity < S < 2/3 * Capacity):**
   - Evaluate the trend of stock levels over recent rounds.
     - If the stock is decreasing, increase the likelihood of defecting.
     - If stable or increasing, continue to cooperate.

3. **Low Stock Level (S ≤ 1/3 * Capacity):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as future gains are limited due to low resource levels.

### Edge Cases:
- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate since the stock is at maximum capacity.
  
- **Last 10% of Rounds:**
  - Shift towards defecting more frequently to capture remaining resources before the game concludes.

### Strategy Summary:
The strategy prioritizes cooperation when the resource level is high to ensure sustainability. It adapts by considering recent trends in stock levels and switches to defection when necessary, especially as the game nears its conclusion. This approach balances individual gain with collective resource management.

# Final Answer

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Strategy:**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Start by Cooperating since the stock is at its maximum capacity, ensuring stability and sustainability.

2. **High Stock Level (S ≥ 2/3 * Capacity):**
   - Continue Cooperating unless nearing the end of the game (last 10% rounds), where defecting becomes advantageous for immediate gains.

3. **Moderate Stock Level (1/3 * S < 2/3 * Capacity):**
   - Monitor stock trends:
     - If decreasing, increase defection likelihood to maximize current payoffs.
     - If stable or increasing, maintain cooperation.

4. **Low Stock Level (S ≤ 1/3 * Capacity):**
   - Defect to capitalize on remaining resources, as future gains are limited.

5. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% Rounds):**
   - Shift to defecting more often to capture what's left before the game concludes.

**Answer:**

The strategy is to Cooperate when the stock level is above two-thirds of capacity and not in the final stages, adapt based on stock trends in moderate levels, Defect at low levels, and shift towards Defection near the end. This approach balances resource sustainability with individual payoff maximization.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate at high levels; defect as needed or nearing game end}}

To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource level through collective action without communication, the following strategy is proposed:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy balances cooperation and defection based on observable state variables (current stock level) and recent history (number of defectors). It aims to sustain the resource when possible and switch to exploitation when necessary.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Establishes a baseline for sustainable resource use.

2. **Middle Rounds (from round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1: Assess Current Stock Level**
     - If stock > 0.8 * capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - Rationale: The resource is healthy and can sustain current use.
     - If stock < 0.6 * capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - Rationale: Exploit remaining resources to maximize immediate payoff before potential depletion.
   - **Step 2: Evaluate Recent Behavior**
     - If the stock is between 0.6 and 0.8 * capacity:
       - Look at the number of defectors in the last three rounds.
       - If more than half were defecting:
         - **Action:** Defect (D)
           - Rationale: Prevent being exploited by others who are defecting.
       - Otherwise:
         - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
           - Rationale: Maintain sustainable resource use when others are cooperating.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff with no future rounds to penalize exploitation.

### Summary of Decision Rules:
- **Cooperate** when the stock is above 80% of capacity.
- **Defect** when the stock drops below 60% or if more than half defected in recent rounds.
- In intermediate cases, cooperate unless there's evidence of widespread defection.

This strategy aims to sustain resource levels while protecting against exploitation, ensuring a balance between cooperation and self-interest.

description_COLLECTIVE_90 = '''
The designed collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances cooperation for sustainability with defection when necessary. It adapts dynamically based on the current state of the resource, opponents' behaviors, and game progression.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above a dynamically adjusted threshold.
   - Defect otherwise to maximize immediate payoff or prevent overexploitation.

2. **Threshold Calculation:**
   - The threshold starts as 80% of capacity and adjusts each round based on:
     - Stock growth rate (higher growth increases threshold, encouraging more cooperation).
     - Opponents' actions (more defecting lowers the threshold to reduce exploitation risk).

3. **Adaptation Mechanism:**
   - After each round, update the threshold using a formula that considers stock replenishment and opponents' defection rates.
   - Example adjustment: If growth is high, increase the threshold by 5%; if low or negative, decrease by 10%.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others and preserve the resource.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20% of rounds):** Lower the threshold to avoid overusing resources with fewer future benefits.
   - **Stock Collapse (near 0):** Defect to maximize remaining payoff, despite limited long-term gains.

5. **Learning from Opponents:**
   - Track opponents' cooperation levels each round. If defecting is prevalent, adjust the threshold lower to minimize exploitation risk.

### Pseudocode:

```python
Initialize:
    threshold = 0.8 * capacity  # Start at 80% of capacity
    rounds_remaining = r

For each round t in 1..r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    if current_stock > threshold:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate
    else:
        action = 'D'  # Defect
    
    record_action(action)
    calculate_growth(current_stock, actions_of_all_players)
    new_stock = update_stock(current_stock, growth)
    
    # Adjust threshold based on growth and opponents' behavior
    if growth > 0.1 * capacity:  # Significant replenishment
        threshold *= 1.05  # Increase threshold by 5%
    else:
        threshold *= 0.90  # Decrease threshold by 10%
    
    # Ensure threshold stays within [2n, capacity] bounds
    threshold = max(min(threshold, capacity), 2 * n)
    
    # For the last few rounds, adjust threshold to be more cautious
    if t > r - 0.2 * r:  # Last 20% of rounds
        threshold = threshold * 0.95  # Become slightly more risk-averse
    
    # If stock is near collapse, encourage defecting
    if new_stock < 0.1 * capacity:
        threshold = max(threshold, capacity)  # Force higher threshold to promote defecting

End
```

### Explanation:

The strategy dynamically adapts to maintain a balance between preserving the resource and maximizing individual payoffs. It encourages cooperation when the stock is healthy and defects when necessary to prevent collapse or exploitation by others. By adjusting thresholds based on observed growth and opponents' behaviors, it remains robust against various strategies in a competitive environment.

**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Begin with Cooperation in the first round to establish a cooperative tone and maximize initial resource growth.

2. **Dynamic Thresholds Based on Stock Health:**
   - **High Stock (Above 80% of Capacity):** Continue Cooperating to allow sustainable growth.
   - **Moderate Stock (40-80%):** 
     - If most players Cooperated in the previous round, continue Cooperating.
     - If a significant number Defected, consider adjusting actions towards Defection if stock is declining.
   - **Low Stock (Below 40%):** Shift towards more Defecting to salvage immediate payoffs before potential collapse.

3. **Learning and Adaptation:**
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on the stock's response to collective actions. If the stock grows despite some Defectors, be more lenient with lower thresholds for Cooperation.

4. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - If a player defects when most others Cooperated, respond by defecting in subsequent rounds to discourage such behavior and encourage future Cooperation.

5. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - Balance between immediate gains and preventing stock collapse. Consider a mix of Coop and Def based on remaining rounds to optimize payoffs without causing rapid depletion.

6. **Forgiving Mechanism:**
   - After a round where many players Defected, revert to Cooperation in the next round if most others Cooperate, helping rebuild trust and sustainable resource levels.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
for each player:
    for each round from 1 to r:
        if current_round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            stock_history = get_stock_history()
            defector_count = count_defectors_in_previous_rounds()
            
            if stock > 0.8 * capacity:
                action = 'C'
            elif 0.4 * capacity < stock <= 0.8 * capacity:
                if defector_count / n < threshold_for_coop:
                    action = 'C'
                else:
                    action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'D' if round > last_round - endgame_buffer else adaptive_action()
        
        submit_action(action)
```

This strategy balances cooperation with adaptability, encouraging sustainable resource management while addressing potential defection through dynamic adjustments and punitive measures.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_92 = '''
**Final Answer:**

The strategy is designed to adaptively balance cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and its trends, promoting collective resource management while maximizing individual payoffs.

---

### **Strategy Description: Adaptive Threshold-Based Cooperation**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 3 rounds):**
   - Cooperate to build a stable stock level and encourage others to follow suit by maintaining high payoffs through sustainable consumption.

2. **Monitoring Stock Trends:**
   - Track the stock level over time.
   - Calculate whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable relative to capacity.

3. **Decision Rules Based on Stock Health:**
   - **Above 80% of Capacity:** Continue Cooperating to sustain high payoffs and maintain resource health.
   - **Between 60%-80% with a Downward Trend:** Consider Defecting to maximize immediate gains while others may still be cooperating.
   - **Below 60%:** Increase Defection to exploit remaining resources before potential collapse.

4. **Adjustment Based on Past Actions:**
   - If stock shows rapid depletion, infer that many players are defecting and respond by defecting to prevent being exploited as a cooperator.

5. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - Shift back to Cooperating to maximize possible payoffs before the game ends, assuming others might do the same.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Start by Cooperating to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Prioritize cooperation to ensure maximum possible payoff from remaining resources.

---

### **Rationale:**

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability. By cooperating when the resource is healthy and defecting as it depletes, each player adapts to observable state variables without needing explicit coordination. This approach aims to prevent rapid depletion while ensuring personal payoffs remain high, promoting a stable equilibrium where cooperation persists until necessary adjustments are made.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_93 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategy that balances sustainable cooperation with maximizing individual payoffs towards the end of the game. The decision rules are structured to maintain the resource when it's abundant and exploit it efficiently as the game concludes.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Thresholds:**
   - Define an upper threshold at 75% of capacity (`capacity * 0.75`) and a lower threshold at 25% of capacity (`capacity * 0.25`).

2. **Early Rounds Strategy:**
   - For rounds until `r - X` (where `X` is a small number, e.g., 5), players should cooperate if the current stock `S` is above the upper threshold. This ensures sustainable use of the resource.
   - If `S` drops below the lower threshold, players defect to prevent further depletion and maximize immediate gains.

3. **Late Rounds Strategy:**
   - In the last `X` rounds, all players defect regardless of the stock level to maximize their payoffs without worrying about future depletions.

4. **Middle Range Handling:**
   - If `S` is between the lower and upper thresholds, players continue cooperating to try and stabilize or increase the resource level.
   - Incorporate a trend analysis (e.g., comparing current `S` with a moving average of past rounds) to decide if defection is necessary even within this range.

5. **Edge Cases Management:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate since `S = capacity`.
   - **Stock Near Capacity:** Maintain cooperation to preserve the resource.
   - **Near Endgame:** Defect in the final rounds to exploit remaining resources without regard for future sustainability.

**Final Answer (Decision Rules):**

- If it's among the last 5 rounds (`t >= r - 4`), defect.
- Else, if current stock `S > capacity * 0.75`, cooperate.
- Else, if `S < capacity * 0.25`, defect.
- Otherwise, continue cooperating to maintain or increase the resource level.

This strategy ensures sustainable use during early rounds while maximizing individual gains in the final stages, balancing cooperation and exploitation effectively. 

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S > 75\% \text{ capacity and not near end; defect otherwise}}

description_COLLECTIVE_94 = '''
To design an adaptive strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that balances cooperation and defection based on the current state of the resource, we focus on dynamically adjusting our actions using the stock level as a key indicator. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating to preserve the resource and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Use a decreasing threshold based on remaining rounds to decide between Cooperate (C) and Defect (D). If the stock is above this threshold, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.
3. **Endgame Defection:** Switch to always Defecting in the final 10% of rounds to maximize immediate payoffs without worrying about future consequences.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Preserve the resource and promote sustainability from the start.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-0.1r):**
   - Calculate the dynamically adjusted threshold:
     - `threshold = capacity * (remaining_rounds / total_rounds)`
     - This threshold decreases as rounds progress, encouraging defection in later stages.
   - Decision Rule:
     - If current stock > threshold: Cooperate (C)
     - Else: Defect (D)

3. **Last 10% of Rounds (Rounds r-0.1r to r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoffs without regard for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock, capacity):
    remaining_rounds = total_rounds - current_round + 1
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif remaining_rounds > 0.1 * total_rounds:
        threshold = capacity * (remaining_rounds / total_rounds)
        if stock > threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Edge Cases and Considerations:

- **Stock Below Critical Levels:** If the stock drops extremely low, the strategy inherently encourages defection as the threshold would be lower.
- **Observation of Other Players:** While not explicitly using others' past actions, the strategy adapts to collective behavior indirectly through changes in the stock level.

### Conclusion:
This strategy aims to maximize long-term sustainability while adapting to potential exploitation by switching towards defection in later rounds. It dynamically balances cooperation and defection based on the resource's health and remaining game duration, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_95 = '''
To address the problem of optimizing individual payoff while considering the collective impact on resource sustainability, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round:** Always Cooperate to establish a baseline of sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity, Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - If the stock drops below 80%, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoff as the resource is already under stress.
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - In the final round, always Defect to capitalize on any remaining resources.

This strategy balances between sustaining the resource when it's healthy and exploiting it when it's depleted, thus maximizing individual gain without causing unnecessary collapse in early rounds.

### Formalized Decision Rules:
1. **If current round is the last round:** Defect.
2. **Else if current stock \( S > 0.8 \times \text{capacity} \):** Cooperate.
3. **Else:** Defect.

This approach ensures that the resource remains sustainable when healthy and allows individuals to maximize their payoff when the resource is already under stress.

### Final Answer:
The optimal strategy for maximizing individual payoff while considering collective impact is:

\boxed{
\begin{cases}
\text{Defect} & \text{if it's the last round}, \\
\text{Cooperate} & \text{if current stock } S > 0.8 \times \text{capacity}, \\
\text{Defect} & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
}

This strategy provides a balance between sustainability and exploitation, ensuring that the resource is preserved when healthy and exploited when necessary to maximize individual gains.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_96 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation among multiple players while preserving a shared resource, an adaptive strategy is proposed. This strategy balances cooperation with necessary defection based on both the current state of the resource and the historical behavior of other players.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Players start by cooperating to encourage sustainable resource use.
2. **Monitoring Mechanisms**:
   - **Stock Level**: Track the current stock relative to capacity (e.g., thresholds at 80% and 40%).
   - **Cooperation Rates**: Monitor the proportion of players who cooperated in recent rounds.
   - **Trend Analysis**: Assess whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable over time.
3. **Decision Rules**:
   - Cooperate if the stock is healthy (above 80%) and sufficient others are cooperating (over 60%).
   - Defect if the stock is critically low (below 40%) or cooperation rates drop significantly despite a healthy stock.
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust behavior based on trends in both resource levels and cooperation rates to sustain cooperation when beneficial and defect when necessary.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```plaintext
For each player i:
    Initialize cooperate_last_round = True
    stock_history = []
    
    For each round t from 1 to r:
        If t == 1:
            action_i = Cooperate
        Else:
            count_coop = number of players who Cooperated in previous round
            proportion_coop = count_coop / n
            
            if len(stock_history) >= 3:
                trend = calculate_trend(stock_history[-3:])
            else:
                trend = 'stable'
            
            if stock_current > 0.8 * capacity:
                if proportion_coop > 0.6 and (trend == 'increasing' or trend == 'stable'):
                    action_i = Cooperate
                else:
                    action_i = Defect
            elif stock_current < 0.4 * capacity:
                action_i = Defect
            else:  # between 40% and 80%
                if proportion_coop > 0.6 and (trend == 'increasing' or trend == 'stable'):
                    action_i = Cooperate
                else:
                    action_i = Defect
        
        Update stock_history with current stock
        Record action_i and observe others' actions for next round.
    
    If t == r:  # Last round
        action_i = Defect
```

### Key Components:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages a positive start, allowing players to build trust and assess others' behavior.
- **Threshold-Based Decisions**: Uses stock levels (80%, 40%) and cooperation rates (60%) as indicators for when to cooperate or defect.
- **Trend Analysis**: Helps anticipate future resource conditions, enabling proactive adjustments in strategy.

This strategy aims to sustain cooperation while being responsive to changes in resource health and other players' actions, ensuring a balance between individual gain and collective resource preservation.

**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (t=1):**
   - All players Cooperate to establish a baseline and avoid immediate resource depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t>1):**
   - Calculate the stock after consumption from the previous round.
   - Determine if the stock is above, below, or equal to a sustainability threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
     - If above the threshold and stable/increasing: Continue Cooperating.
     - If below or decreasing: Switch to Defecting to reduce consumption and allow recovery.

3. **Last Few Rounds (t approaching r):**
   - Maintain Cooperation to maximize cumulative payoffs, despite the game nearing its end.

4. **Response to Others' Actions:**
   - If previous rounds saw significant Defection leading to low stock: Cooperate to replenish.
   - If most Cooperated and stock was stable/increasing: Continue Cooperating.

5. **Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Dynamically adjust the sustainability threshold based on historical performance:
     - Increase if stock remains stable with Cooperation.
     - Lower if stock decreases, prompting more Defecting.

6. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - Initial rounds focus on building resource stability.
   - Final rounds maintain Cooperation to maximize payoffs.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
For each player i:
    For each round t = 1 to r:
        If t == 1:
            Action = Cooperate
        Else:
            Calculate stock after consumption (S_prev)
            Determine sustainability threshold (e.g., capacity * 0.5)
            If S_prev > threshold and trend is stable/increasing:
                Action = Cooperate
            Else:
                Action = Defect
        Record action, observe others' actions, and update thresholds based on historical performance.
```

**Conclusion:**
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability by adapting to current conditions and adjusting strategies based on past outcomes. It is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors while promoting collective cooperation for optimal payoffs.

description_COLLECTIVE_98 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock Levels**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to maintain a high stock level and encourage sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Cooperate if:** The current stock is above 70% of the capacity.
   - **Assess Trends if:** The stock is between 30% and 70%:
     - If the stock has been decreasing over the past few rounds, defect with a higher probability (e.g., 75% chance to Defect).
     - If the trend is stable or increasing, continue Cooperating.
   - **Defect if:** The stock drops below 30% of capacity.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact on the stock.

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation in Early Rounds:** Maintains a high stock level, promoting sustainable growth.
- **Trend Assessment:** Helps anticipate others' actions and adapt accordingly without relying on coordination.
- **Thresholds (70%, 30%):** Provide clear decision points to balance resource maintenance and immediate gains.

This strategy is adaptive, robust, and aligns with collective sustainability goals while being responsive to potential defection trends.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_99 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a decision-making strategy that balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with strategic defection when necessary. Here's a structured summary of the approach:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy is designed to maintain cooperation when the resource stock is healthy or improving and to allow defection when the stock is low or declining. It also considers the progression of the game, adjusting behavior as it nears its conclusion.

### Key Decision Points

1. **Initial State (High Stock):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning:** The resource stock is at capacity, and cooperation ensures sustainable consumption without depleting the resource.

2. **Mid-Game Adjustments:**
   - **Cooperate if:**
     - The current stock exceeds 80% of capacity.
     - The stock is between 60%-80% and has been stable or increasing over recent rounds.
   - **Defect if:**
     - The current stock drops below 60% of capacity.
     - Despite cooperation, the stock continues to decline.

3. **End-Game Considerations:**
   - In the final 25% of rounds, prioritize defecting to maximize immediate payoffs, accepting potential resource depletion since future rounds are limited.

### Detailed Decision Rules

1. **Cooperate Conditions:**
   - When the current stock is above 80% of capacity.
   - Between 60%-80%, if the stock has shown an increasing trend over the past few rounds.

2. **Defect Conditions:**
   - If the stock falls below 60% of capacity.
   - If cooperation in previous rounds hasn't halted a decreasing trend in the stock.

3. **End-Game Adjustment:**
   - In the final quarter of the game, defect to capitalize on remaining resources, even if it leads to depletion.

### Rationale
This strategy aims to sustain the resource by encouraging cooperation when healthy and allowing defection only when necessary or toward the end. It adapts dynamically based on current stock levels and trends, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

By following these rules, players can collectively maintain a stable resource base while adapting to changes and maximizing payoffs as the game concludes.

The "Adaptive Harvest" strategy is designed to maximize payoffs in the Common Pool Resource Game by balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a structured breakdown of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Harvest

1. **Initial Testing Phase (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Purpose:** To observe other players' behaviors and gather data on their tendencies towards cooperation or defection.

2. **Monitoring in Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the historical cooperation rate (H) among all players from previous rounds.
   - Track the current stock level (S).

3. **Decision Rules Based on H and S:**
   - **If H is above a threshold and S is healthy:** Cooperate to sustain the resource and ensure long-term gains.
   - **If H drops below the threshold or S is low:** Defect to maximize immediate payoffs, especially if others are not cooperating.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Defect as part of the initial testing phase.
   - **Last Round:** Defect since there's no future punishment possible.
   - **Stock Near Capacity:** Cooperate if H is high; defect otherwise to test others' willingness.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Defect to avoid being exploited by defectors.

5. **Adjustment Over Time:**
   - Adjust the cooperation threshold based on observed trends, lowering it if more players cooperate and raising it if defection increases.
   - Consider using weighted averages of recent cooperation rates to smooth out fluctuations and stabilize decisions.

### Pseudocode Outline

    coop_count = sum(1 for action in all_player_actions if action == COOPERATE)
    return coop_count / total_actions

# Get current stock level from game state

```

### Conclusion

The "Adaptive Harvest" strategy dynamically adjusts between cooperation and defection based on observed cooperation rates and current resource levels. By starting with a testing phase, it gathers necessary data to inform subsequent decisions, aiming to maximize payoffs while maintaining the sustainability of the common pool resource. This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors and adapts over time to changing conditions in the game.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by adapting to past actions and current stock levels. Here's a structured outline of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Rounds**: Start by Cooperating to build up the common pool resource, setting a positive precedent for sustainability.

2. **Threshold Calculation**:
   - Calculate a weighted average of all players' past actions over the last k rounds, with higher weights on more recent rounds.
   - This cooperation threshold reflects the proportion of times players have Cooperated historically.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - **Cooperate**: If the cooperation threshold is above 0.7 (indicating high past cooperation) and the stock is above 50% of capacity, continue Cooperating to sustain the resource.
   - **Defect**: If the cooperation threshold falls below 0.3 or the stock drops below 25%, switch to Defecting to reduce consumption and allow the resource to recover.
   - **Moderate Stock**: Maintain Cooperation if others are also Cooperating, but remain adaptable based on thresholds.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Default to Cooperate due to lack of history.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 5% of rounds)**: Continue Cooperating unless the stock is extremely low to prevent collapse.
   - **Stock Near Capacity**: Cooperate to maximize sustainable growth.
   - **Stock Near Zero**: Defect temporarily to allow recovery.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate weighted average of past actions
    k = min(20, len(history))  # Consider up to last 20 rounds
    weights = [0.5 ** i for i in range(k)]  # Exponential decay weights
    total_weight = sum(weights)
    
    cooperation_threshold = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if round_number - i - 1 >= 0:
            actions = history[round_number - i - 1]
            avg_coop = sum(1 for a in actions.values() if a == 'C') / len(actions)
            cooperation_threshold += weights[i] * avg_coop
    
    cooperation_threshold /= total_weight
    
    # Determine action based on thresholds and stock level
    high_threshold = 0.7
    low_threshold = 0.3
    mid_stock = capacity * 0.5
    low_stock = capacity * 0.25
    
    if current_stock > mid_stock and cooperation_threshold > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < low_stock or cooperation_threshold < low_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Additional logic for moderate stock conditions can be added here
        return 'C'  # Default to Cooperate if unsure

# Example usage:
history = [...]  # List of past actions per round
current_round = ...  # Current round number
current_stock = get_current_stock()
capacity = ...  # Given capacity

action = decide_action(current_round, history, current_stock, capacity)
```

### Conclusion

This strategy encourages cooperation when beneficial and adapts to defection by others or resource depletion. By dynamically adjusting based on past actions and current stock levels, it aims to maximize both immediate payoffs and long-term sustainability, ensuring the common pool resource remains viable for all players throughout the game.

**Strategy: Adaptive Conditional Cooperation (ACC)**

The Adaptive Conditional Cooperation (ACC) strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability in the Common Pool Resource Game. It dynamically adjusts based on the current stock level and past cooperation trends among players, encouraging mutual cooperation while protecting against exploitation.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Reason: Starting with Cooperation helps maintain the resource at a healthy level, promoting sustainability in subsequent rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds (Remaining 60% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Check Current Stock Level:**
     - If stock > 75% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - Reason: The resource is sufficiently abundant to sustain cooperation without risking depletion.
     - If stock < 50% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - Reason: The resource is under stress, and defecting maximizes immediate gains before potential collapse.
   - **If Stock is Between 50% and 75% of Capacity:**
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate from the previous round (number of Cooperators / n).
     - If cooperation rate > 60%:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - Reason: High cooperation suggests a cooperative environment, encouraging mutual sustainability.
     - If cooperation rate < 40%:
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - Reason: Low cooperation indicates potential exploitation; defecting prevents being taken advantage of.
     - If cooperation rate is between 40% and 60%:
       - Use a weighted decision favoring Cooperate if stock is closer to 75%, or Defect if closer to 50%.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Reason: With no future rounds, maximizing immediate payoff is rational.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate to encourage mutual sustainability.
  
- **Stock Near Capacity (>80%):**
  - Continue Cooperating as growth can sustain the resource.
  
- **Stock Near Depletion (<30%):**
  - Switch to Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources.

---

### **Rationale**

ACC dynamically balances Cooperation and Defection based on observable metrics (current stock, past cooperation rates) to foster a cooperative environment while protecting against exploitation. By adapting to both resource state and player behavior, ACC aims to maximize long-term sustainability and individual payoff.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, prev_coop_rate, total_rounds, current_round):
    if current_round <= 0.2 * total_rounds:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif current_round > 0.8 * total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
            return "Cooperate"
        elif current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return "Defect"
        else:
            if prev_coop_rate > 0.6:
                return "Cooperate"
            elif prev_coop_rate < 0.4:
                return "Defect"
            else:
                # Weighted decision: favor Cooperate if stock is closer to 75%, Defect otherwise
                mid_stock = 0.625 * capacity
                if current_stock > mid_stock:
                    return "Cooperate"
                else:
                    return "Defect"
```

This strategy provides a structured approach to balancing Cooperation and Defection, ensuring adaptability to changing game dynamics while promoting mutual benefits for all players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_103 = '''
The strategy is designed to balance individual gain with collective sustainability by adapting to the current state of the common pool and the behavior of other players. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Default action: Cooperate (C). This sets a positive precedent and encourages others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Calculate Recent Cooperation Rate:** Determine the average cooperation rate among players over recent rounds (e.g., last k rounds).
   - **Stock Check:** Assess if the current stock is above a predefined low threshold (e.g., half of capacity).

3. **Cooperation Thresholds:**
   - If the stock is above the low threshold and the recent cooperation rate exceeds a set percentage (e.g., 70%), choose Cooperate (C).
   - Otherwise, choose Defect (D) to maximize individual payoff when collective action fails.

### Edge Cases:
- **Last Few Rounds:** Adjust cooperation thresholds to be more lenient towards defecting due to the absence of future rounds, acknowledging potential increased defection by others.
- **Low Stock Situations:** If the stock is critically low, prioritize cooperation to facilitate regrowth and prevent complete depletion.

### Pseudocode Summary:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, recent_cooperation_rate):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        low_stock_threshold = capacity / 2
        cooperate_threshold = 0.7  # Example threshold

        if (current_stock > low_stock_threshold and 
            recent_cooperation_rate > cooperate_threshold):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Note: Adjust thresholds based on specific game parameters for optimal performance.
```

### Strategy Justification:
This approach ensures adaptability by considering both the current state of the resource and historical player behavior. It encourages cooperation when beneficial for sustainability but allows defecting when necessary, balancing individual gain with collective outcomes. This robust strategy is designed to perform well against a variety of opponent behaviors in repeated interactions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_104 = '''
To address the problem, we need a strategy that balances cooperation to maintain a healthy stock level with defection to maximize immediate payoffs, especially as the game nears its conclusion. The solution involves monitoring the stock level relative to capacity thresholds and adjusting actions based on previous rounds' majority cooperation.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to build a healthy stock base.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**:
   - **High Stock (Above 75% Capacity)**: Mirror others' actions; if most Cooperated last round, Cooperate again; otherwise, Defect.
   - **Medium Stock (Between 25% and 75% Capacity)**: Always Cooperate to encourage stock growth.
   - **Low Stock (Below 25% Capacity)**: If the majority Cooperated last round, continue Cooperating; else, Defect.
3. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final 20% of rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoffs since there's no future beyond these rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(history, current_round, state, opponent_history):
    capacity = 1  # Assuming normalized capacity
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    medium_low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # Determine the majority action in the last round
    num_players = len(opponent_history)
    last_round_actions = [action[-1] for action in opponent_history]
    cooperate_count = sum(1 for a in last_round_actions if a == 'C')
    majority_cooperate = (cooperate_count / num_players) > 0.5
    
    current_stock = state['current_stock'] if 'current_stock' in state else capacity
    # Adjust the stock calculation as per actual game dynamics if needed
    
    # Check how many rounds are left to determine endgame strategy
    total_rounds = len(history[0]) + 1  # Current round is included
    percentage_remaining = (total_rounds - current_round) / total_rounds
    
    if percentage_remaining <= 0.2:
        return 'Defect'
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        if majority_cooperate:
            return 'Cooperate'
        else:
            return 'Defect'
    elif medium_low_threshold < current_stock <= high_threshold:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:  # current_stock <= medium_low_threshold
        if majority_cooperate:
            return 'Cooperate'
        else:
            return 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round**: The strategy starts by Cooperating to build a healthy stock base.
- **High Stock (Above 75%)**: It mirrors the majority action from the previous round. If most players Cooperated, it continues to Cooperate; otherwise, it Defects.
- **Medium Stock (25% to 75%)**: The strategy always Cooperates to encourage growth and avoid depleting the stock too quickly.
- **Low Stock (Below 25%)**: It Cooperates if the majority did so last round, aiming to rebuild the stock; otherwise, it Defects.
- **Endgame (Final 20% Rounds)**: The strategy defects to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited or nonexistent.

This approach balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and others' actions.

description_COLLECTIVE_105 = '''
**Final Answer: Dynamic Cooperator Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection adaptively, ensuring sustainable resource use while responding to opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round:** Cooperate if the stock is above 80% of capacity. This promotes early sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Cooperate** if the current stock is above a dynamic threshold (adjusting based on n and capacity) and most recent actions show a high proportion of cooperation.
   - **Defect** if the stock is below the threshold or there's significant defection in past rounds, preventing exploitation.
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are irrelevant.
   - **Stock Near Capacity:** Cooperate to maintain high payoffs and resource levels.

### Pseudocode:
```python
function decide_action(stock, history, round_number):
    if round_number == 1:
        if stock >= capacity * 0.8:
            return C
        else:
            return D
    else:
        recent_coop = count(history[-window:]) / window
        current_threshold = calculate_dynamic_threshold(n, capacity)
        
        if stock > current_threshold and recent_coop > 0.6:
            return C
        else:
            return D
```

### Threshold Adjustment:
- **Dynamic Threshold Calculation:** Adjusts based on n and capacity to maintain resource sustainability.
- **Recent Cooperation Check:** Considers the proportion of cooperators in recent rounds to gauge collective behavior.

This strategy promotes cooperation when resources are plentiful and adjusts to defection trends, ensuring robust performance against various opponents.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_106 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

Our strategy balances cooperation with defecting based on stock levels and recent player behavior, aiming to sustain resources while maximizing individual payoffs.

---

### **Strategy Overview**
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to encourage others and maintain a sustainable resource level.
2. **Adaptive Behavior**: In middle rounds, cooperate if the stock is above 75% of capacity and most recent actions were cooperative; otherwise, defect.
3. **Final Round Exploitation**: Defect in the last round to maximize individual payoff.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **First Round (t=1)**:
   - Always Cooperate (`C`) to set a positive precedent.

2. **Middle Rounds (2 ≤ t < r)**:
   - Calculate the current stock `S`.
   - Determine if `S` is above 75% of capacity.
   - Check recent cooperation by counting cooperations in the last 3 rounds.
     - If more than half were Cooperate and `S > 0.75 * capacity`, continue Cooperating.
     - Otherwise, Defect (`D`).

3. **Last Round (t=r)**:
   - Always Defect (`D`) to maximize individual payoff with no future consequences.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, stock, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        threshold = 0.75 * capacity
        k = 3  # Number of recent rounds to consider
        recent_history = history[-k:] if len(history) >= k else history
        recent_coop = sum(1 for action in recent_history if action == 'C') / len(recent_history)
        
        if stock > threshold and recent_coop >= 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**
- If the stock drops significantly below the threshold, players defect to exploit remaining resources.
- Players adapt quickly to changes in others' behavior, maintaining cooperation only when beneficial.

This strategy balances sustainability with self-interest, promoting long-term resource management while allowing exploitation when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_107 = '''
To address the challenge of sustainably managing a common resource among multiple players, we propose the following strategy:

**Strategy: Conditional Cooperation Based on Current Resource Level**

1. **Threshold Setting**: Establish a threshold (e.g., 75% of maximum capacity) to determine when cooperation is necessary to prevent resource depletion.

2. **Player Actions**:
   - **If current_stock > threshold**: Players defect, maximizing their gain while the resource is abundant.
   - **If current_stock ≤ threshold**: Players cooperate, minimizing consumption to allow the resource to recover and sustain future use.

3. **Rationale**:
   - Defecting when the resource is plentiful (above the threshold) allows players to benefit from higher yields without risking long-term depletion.
   - Cooperating when the resource is scarce ensures that it can replenish, preventing a tragedy of the commons scenario where overexploitation leads to irreversible loss.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Players independently assess the current stock level each round and adjust their strategy accordingly without needing communication or coordination.

5. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - The resource remains sustainable as cooperation curtails consumption when necessary, while defecting is permissible during periods of abundance.
   - This balance helps maintain the resource's health over time, preventing it from being exhausted by excessive exploitation.

By following this strategy, players can maximize their individual gains while collectively ensuring the resource's longevity.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_108 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance individual gains with collective sustainability, adapting based on current stock levels and opponents' behavior. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage sustainable resource management.
2. **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.
3. **Middle Rounds**:
   - **High Stock (Above 75% Capacity)**: Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - **Low Stock (Below 25% Capacity)**: Defect to salvage remaining resources.
   - **Moderate Stock**: Adjust based on recent cooperation rates among players:
     - If most players have been Cooperating, continue Cooperating to support resource recovery.
     - If many are Defecting, switch to Defecting to prevent exploitation and secure immediate gains.

### Decision Rules

- **First Round Action**:
  - Always Cooperate (C) to set a positive precedent for sustainability.

- **Last Round Action**:
  - Always Defect (D) to maximize payoff since there are no future consequences.

- **Middle Rounds Action**:
  - If current stock > 75% of capacity: Cooperate.
  - If current stock < 25% of capacity: Defect.
  - If stock is between 25% and 75%:
    - Calculate the proportion of Cooperators in recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds).
    - If more than 60% of players have been Cooperating: Continue Cooperating.
    - Else: Switch to Defecting.

        return 'C'
    elif current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    else:

                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages others to contribute sustainably.
- **Final Round Defection**: Maximizes immediate payoff when future rounds don't matter.
- **Threshold-Based Adjustments**: Balances individual gain with collective sustainability, adapting based on resource levels and opponents' actions.

This strategy aims to perform well against various opponent behaviors by dynamically adjusting actions based on observed conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_109 = '''
**Final Answer:**

The proposed collective strategy balances cooperation when resources are abundant and others cooperate with defection when resources are scarce or others defect. Here's a structured breakdown:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Sets a cooperative tone to prevent rapid resource depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the proportion of players who Defected in the previous round (`defection_rate`).
   - **Step 2:** Compute the current stock level as a percentage of capacity (`stock_pct = stock / capacity`).
   - **Decision Rules:**
     - If `stock_pct > 80%` AND `defection_rate < 30%`: Cooperate.
     - Otherwise (if `stock_pct ≤ 80%` OR `defection_rate ≥ 30%`): Defect.

**Rationale for Decision Rules:**
- **Cooperate:** Maintains a cooperative environment when resources are abundant and most players are cooperating, ensuring long-term sustainability.
- **Defect:** Encourages defection to either reduce personal consumption (when resources are low) or retaliate against defectors, promoting cooperation in future rounds.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to avoid immediate crashes.
- **Last Round:** Since the number of rounds is fixed but unknown, the strategy remains consistent across all rounds except the first.

This strategy aims to foster a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability, adapting to different scenarios by encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defection when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_110 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Threshold**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate (C) to maintain high stock levels and maximize collective payoffs.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Each player monitors the previous round's actions of all other players.
   - If all players Cooperated in the last round and the current stock is above 50% of capacity:
     - Continue to Cooperate (C).
   - Otherwise:
     - Switch to Defecting (D) for the next rounds until cooperation is observed again.

3. **Stock Threshold Adjustment:**
   - If the stock level drops below 50% of capacity, players switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoffs and prevent further resource depletion.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final 10% of rounds (i.e., last few rounds), players always Defect (D) to secure higher individual payoffs without concern for future sustainability.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Players consider the average action of others. If more than half of the players Cooperated, continue to Cooperate; otherwise, switch to Defecting.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players()
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    all_cooperated = True
    for action in history['others']:
        if action != 'C':
            all_cooperated = False
    
    stock_threshold = capacity * 0.5
    
    endgame_rounds = total_rounds * 0.1
    if round_number > (total_rounds - endgame_rounds):
        return 'D'
    
    if all_cooperated and current_stock >= stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy begins with cooperation to sustain the resource, ensuring stable payoffs.
- It dynamically adjusts by defecting if others defect or if the stock is critically low, preventing further depletion.
- In the endgame phase, players focus on maximizing immediate gains, reflecting a shift from long-term sustainability to short-term benefit.

This approach balances between fostering cooperation for sustainable outcomes and adaptively responding to defection or resource scarcity, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.

description_COLLECTIVE_111 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperative-Defection Strategy**

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoff while maintaining sustainability of the common pool resource through adaptive cooperation and controlled defection.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Start by conserving the resource to encourage growth for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the expected stock level if all players had Cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Step 2:** Compare this expected stock with the actual new_stock after consumption.
     - **If Actual Stock < Expected Stock:**
       - **Threshold Check:** If (Expected Stock - Actual Stock) > Defection Threshold, switch to Defect for the next x rounds.
     - **Else:**
       - Continue Cooperating.

3. **Endgame Rounds (Last y Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff as future rounds no longer impact sustainability.

### Adaptive Mechanisms:

- **Defection Threshold:** A predetermined value to detect significant defection by others, preventing false positives.
- **Response Period (x Rounds):** Duration to remain in Defect mode after detecting defection, allowing time for resource recovery or influencing others' behavior.
- **Endgame Trigger (y Rounds):** Switch to Defect in the final y rounds to capitalize on remaining resources.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(history):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    current_round = len(history) + 1

    # Initial Round Handling
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Calculate Expected Stock If All Cooperated
    previous_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    expected_consumption = n * (previous_stock / (2*n))
    expected_remaining = previous_stock - expected_consumption
    expected_growth = 2 * expected_remaining * (1 - expected_remaining/capacity)
    expected_new_stock = min(expected_remaining + expected_growth, capacity)

    # Actual Stock After Previous Round
    actual_new_stock = history[-1]['new_stock']

    # Defection Detection
    discrepancy = expected_new_stock - actual_new_stock
    if discrepancy > defection_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

    # Endgame Handling
    if current_round >= r - endgame_trigger + 1:
        return 'D'
```

### Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to start sustainably.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Switch to Defect to maximize immediate gains as future payoffs are irrelevant.

### Thresholds and Parameters:

- **Defection Threshold:** Set based on expected variance from cooperative play, ensuring responsiveness without overreacting.
- **Response Period (x):** Typically 2-3 rounds to allow for potential resource recovery or behavior adjustment.
- **Endgame Trigger (y):** Usually set as the last 5% of total rounds, promoting aggressive Defection in final stages.

### Rationale:

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by monitoring others' actions through stock changes. It adapts dynamically, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting strategically to prevent resource depletion. The endgame phase ensures maximum payoff utilization as the game concludes.

description_COLLECTIVE_112 = '''
To design a robust strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on balancing individual gain with collective sustainability. The strategy adapts dynamically based on the current state and rounds remaining, ensuring cooperation when sustainable and defecting when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to maintain resource levels.
2. **Dynamic Threshold for Cooperation:** Calculate a threshold based on remaining rounds and capacity. Cooperate if the stock is above this threshold; otherwise, defect.
3. **Adjustment for Sustainability:** Ensure that cooperation continues as long as it doesn't deplete resources beyond recovery.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, total_rounds, current_round):
    # Calculate required stock based on remaining rounds
    remaining_rounds = total_rounds - current_round + 1
    threshold = (capacity * remaining_rounds) / total_rounds
    
    # Ensure the threshold doesn't drop below 50% of capacity
    threshold = max(threshold, capacity * 0.5)
    
    if stock >= threshold:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"
```

### Edge Cases and Adjustments:
- **First Round:** Always cooperate since the stock is at full capacity.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Maintain a higher threshold to encourage cooperation until the end, preventing total depletion.

This strategy ensures that players contribute to resource sustainability while adapting to others' actions, promoting collective stability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_113 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round based on game parameters, state, and history, we've developed a strategic approach that balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

### Step 1: Initial Setup
- **First Round Action:** Start by Cooperating ('C') to promote a sustainable resource level.
- **Thresholds Definition:** 
  - `threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity` (e.g., 80% of maximum capacity).
  - `threshold_low = 0.6 * capacity` (e.g., 60% of maximum capacity).
  - A hysteresis effect is implemented to prevent oscillations, requiring a higher threshold to switch back from 'D' to 'C'.

### Step 2: Late Rounds Handling
- **Endgame Strategy:** In the last 5 rounds, always Defect ('D') to maximize immediate payoffs as there's no future benefit from Cooperating.

### Step 3: Decision Logic Based on Current Stock
1. **High Stock Levels (S > threshold_high):**
   - Continue Cooperating to maintain the resource and allow growth.
   
2. **Low Stock Levels (S < threshold_low):**
   - Switch to Defecting ('D') to maximize personal gain before potential depletion.

3. **Middle Range (threshold_low ≤ S ≤ threshold_high):**
   - **Recent Behavior Check:** Examine the cooperation rate of all players over the last 5 rounds.
     - If more than 70% have been Cooperating, continue Cooperating ('C') to support sustainability.
     - Otherwise, switch to Defecting ('D') to avoid being exploited.

### Step 4: Hysteresis Implementation
- To prevent frequent switching between 'C' and 'D', a hysteresis effect is applied. The strategy requires the stock level to exceed an even higher threshold (e.g., 85% of capacity) before reverting from 'D' back to 'C'.

### Step 5: Dynamic Adaptation
- The strategy dynamically adapts based on observed behavior and current resource levels, ensuring a balance between individual payoff maximization and collective resource sustainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(stock, history):
    global current_round, state
    capacity = 100  # Example capacity; replace with actual value if needed
    threshold_high = capacity * 0.8
    threshold_low = capacity * 0.6
    hysteresis_threshold = capacity * 0.85  # Higher than threshold_high for switching back to C

    current_round += 1
    rounds_remaining = r - current_round  # Assuming 'r' is the total number of rounds

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'

    if rounds_remaining < 5:
        return 'D'

    if state == 'C':
        if stock < threshold_low:
            state = 'D'
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Check recent cooperation rate
            recent_coop_rate = calculate_recent_coop(history[-5:])
            if recent_coop_rate > 0.7:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'  # Temporarily defect if others are not cooperating enough
    elif state == 'D':
        if stock > hysteresis_threshold:
            state = 'C'
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

def calculate_recent_coop(recent_history):
    n_coop = sum(1 for action in recent_history if action == 'C')
    return n_coop / len(recent_history) if recent_history else 0
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts by Cooperating to encourage a sustainable resource level.
- **Threshold-Based Decisions:** By using thresholds, the strategy adapts to current resource levels, switching to Defecting when resources are low and Cooperating when they're abundant.
- **Recent Behavior Adaptation:** Observing past actions helps decide whether others are Cooperating or not, influencing the decision to either continue Cooperating or start Defecting.
- **Hysteresis Effect:** Prevents oscillations by requiring a higher threshold before reverting from 'D' to 'C', ensuring stability in strategy.

This approach balances individual gain with collective sustainability, dynamically adapting to changing conditions and promoting cooperation when beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_114 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we must balance immediate gains against long-term sustainability. The strategy should encourage cooperation when beneficial but adapt to exploiters by defecting when necessary. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with Cooperate in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Use dynamic thresholds (HT and LT) based on historical stock levels and player behavior to decide actions.
3. **Adaptation Based on Stock Levels**:
   - Cooperate if the stock is above a high threshold (HT) and cooperation is prevalent.
   - Defect if the stock drops below HT or a significant number of players defect, indicating overuse risk.
4. **Adjust Thresholds Dynamically**: Modify thresholds after each round considering stock growth and past actions to maintain optimal resource levels.

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If stock > HT and proportion of cooperators in recent rounds is above a certain level: Cooperate.
   - Else: Defect to maximize individual gain while resources last.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round Known**: Defect to grab remaining resources.
   - **Stock Near Capacity**: Cooperate to sustain growth.

### Pseudocode

```python
initialize:
    cooperation = True
    HT = capacity * 0.8  # Example threshold
    LT = capacity * 0.2
    recent_defectors = []

for each round in rounds:
    if current_round == first_round:
        play Cooperate
    else:
        stock_level = get_current_stock()
        proportion_defectors = count(recent_defectors) / n

        if stock_level > HT and proportion_defectors < 0.3:
            play Cooperate
        else:
            play Defect

    update_thresholds(stock_level, past_actions)
    recent_defectors.update(get_opponents_last_round_actions())

def update_thresholds(stock_level, past_actions):
    global HT, LT
    growth = calculate_growth(stock_level - total_consumption)
    if growth > average_growth:
        HT *= 1.05  # Increase threshold slightly
        LT *= 1.02
    else:
        HT *= 0.95  # Decrease threshold to be cautious
        LT *= 0.98

def calculate_growth(stock_remaining):
    return 2 * stock_remaining * (1 - stock_remaining / capacity)
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Sets a positive precedent and encourages others to maintain the resource.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust based on historical data to ensure sustainability without rigid constraints.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Balances cooperation and defection, adapting to both resource levels and opponents' actions.

This strategy aims to maximize long-term payoffs by fostering cooperation while protecting against exploitation, ensuring adaptability across various game dynamics.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_115 = '''
Each player assesses the current stock of the resource. They cooperate if the stock is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity) and defect otherwise.

**Answer:**

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the current stock is above a certain threshold; otherwise, defect.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_116 = '''
**Strategy Outline for Managing Shared Resources:**

1. **Initial State**: Start by Cooperating to foster an environment conducive to shared resource management.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Assess the cooperation rate from the previous round (number of Cooperators divided by total players).
   - If the current stock level is above a high threshold (e.g., 80% capacity), continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock level is below this threshold but the cooperation rate exceeds a moderate threshold (e.g., 60%), Cooperate to encourage others and maintain resource health.
   - If neither condition is met, switch to Defecting to signal dissatisfaction with low cooperation and potential exploitation.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - In the final round, always Cooperate to preserve any Cooperative progress made throughout the game.
   - If the stock level drops below a critical low threshold (e.g., 20% capacity), revert to Cooperating to attempt resource rebuilding, regardless of current cooperation rates.

4. **State Transitions**:
   - Incorporate hysteresis by setting higher thresholds for returning to Cooperation after defecting to prevent oscillations and provide time for others to adjust their strategies.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging Cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation. It adapts dynamically based on current conditions and past behaviors, aiming to maintain resource health and foster a Cooperative environment over time.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_117 = '''
To address this problem, we've developed a strategic approach for an AI player participating in a repeated common-pool resource game. The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to the observed health of the shared resource.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same, fostering growth.
2. **Adaptive Strategy Based on Stock Health**:
   - **Cooperate** if the average stock level over the past few rounds is above a high threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity).
   - **Defect** if the average drops below a lower threshold (e.g., 70%) to signal concern or prevent further depletion.
3. **Hysteresis Mechanism**: Maintain the current strategy within an intermediate range (between 70% and 90%) to avoid unnecessary oscillations, ensuring stability.

This approach uses observable data about the stock's health to make informed decisions without relying on knowledge of other players' strategies, making it robust for a tournament setting.

### Solution Code
```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "SustainablePlayer"
        self.cooperate_count = 0
        self.defect_count = 0
        self.stock_history = []
        self.current_strategy = 'C'  # Start with Cooperate

    def action(self, history):
        if not history:
            return 'C'
        
        # Keep track of the last few rounds' stock levels
        recent_stock = history[-1]['stock']
        self.stock_history.append(recent_stock)
        # Consider average over past 3 rounds or all available if less than 3
        lookback = min(len(self.stock_history), 3)
        avg_stock = sum(self.stock_history[-lookback:]) / lookback
        
        capacity = 100.0  # Assuming capacity is 100 based on examples
        high_threshold = 0.9 * capacity
        low_threshold = 0.7 * capacity

        if self.current_strategy == 'C':
            if avg_stock < low_threshold:
                self.current_strategy = 'D'
        else:  # current strategy is D
            if avg_stock > high_threshold:
                self.current_strategy = 'C'

        return self.current_strategy
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The player starts with a cooperative stance to promote resource growth.
- **Stock Monitoring**: Tracks the average stock level over recent rounds to assess sustainability.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Switches between Cooperating and Defecting based on predefined thresholds, ensuring actions align with the current health of the resource.
- **Stability Through Hysteresis**: Avoids frequent changes by maintaining strategies within an intermediate range, enhancing overall stability.

This strategy effectively balances immediate rewards with future sustainability, encouraging others to participate cooperatively while safeguarding against resource depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_118 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a balance between cooperation and defection while considering the resource's health and future sustainability, we propose the following strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first round to establish a foundation for sustaining the resource.

2. **Adaptive Behavior Based on Past Actions**:
   - For each subsequent round (from 2 to r-2), assess the previous round's cooperation rate and current stock level.
     - If more than half of the players cooperated in the last round, and the current stock is above 75% of capacity, continue to cooperate.
     - Otherwise, defect to prevent resource depletion.

3. **Final Rounds Adjustment**:
   - In the last two rounds (r-1 and r), prioritize cooperation over defection. This aims to sustain the resource for any potential future play beyond the given rounds, despite the temptation to defect in the final round for immediate gain.

4. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - Use thresholds (75% stock level) and majority cooperation (e.g., >50%) as triggers for cooperative behavior, ensuring sustainability while adapting to others' actions.

This strategy aims to foster a self-reinforcing loop of cooperation when sustainable and defect only when necessary, balancing immediate gains with long-term resource health.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_119 = '''
The optimal strategy for managing the resource sustainably while maximizing individual payoffs involves a balanced approach where players defect when the stock is abundant and cooperate to allow recovery when the stock is depleted. Here's how it can be structured:

**Strategy:**

1. **Defect When Stock is Abundant:** Players should defect (harvest more) when the current stock level exceeds 75% of the capacity. This allows them to take advantage of the plentiful resource without causing immediate depletion.

2. **Cooperate for Recovery:** When the stock is between 25% and 75% of capacity, players should cooperate by harvesting less. This helps preserve the resource and allows it to replenish over time, ensuring sustainability.

3. **Scavenge When Stock is Low:** If the stock drops below 25% of capacity, players should defect again, as the resource is already severely depleted. At this point, players aim to salvage what they can before the resource collapses entirely.

**Implementation:**

- Players continuously monitor the current stock level.
- Based on the stock level, each player independently decides whether to defect or cooperate using the thresholds defined above.

**Example Walkthrough:**

For a system with `n=4` and `capacity=100`:

- **Initial State (Round 1):**
  - Stock = 100 (75% of capacity is 75).
  - Since 100 > 75, all players defect.
  - Each player's payoff: 25
  - Total consumption: 100 → Stock drops to 0.

- **Round 2:**
  - Stock = 0 (below 25%).
  - Players defect again.
  - Payoff: 0 for all players.

This example illustrates a potential flaw where immediate depletion occurs if all players defect in the first round. To mitigate this, consider adjusting thresholds or incorporating additional strategies to prevent such collapses. However, under the given constraints, this strategy provides a framework for balancing individual gains and resource sustainability.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is for each player to defect when the stock exceeds 75% of capacity, cooperate between 25% and 75%, and defect again below 25%. This balances harvesting with preservation. The final answer is:

$\boxed{\text{Defect if } S > 0.75C, \text{ Cooperate if } 0.25C \leq S \leq 0.75C, \text{ Defect if } S < 0.25C}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_120 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource level while allowing for strategic defection, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both current stock levels and historical player behavior.

### Approach
The strategy involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players cooperate to ensure the resource is not immediately depleted.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: For subsequent rounds:
   - Players check if the current stock level is below half of the capacity (`c/2`). If so, they cooperate to prevent further depletion.
   - If the current stock is above `c/2`, players assess the historical behavior of other participants by calculating the average defection rate over previous rounds. If this rate exceeds 50%, indicating a tendency towards resource depletion, players switch to cooperation to aid recovery.

This approach balances immediate gains from defection with the need for long-term sustainability through cooperation, creating a feedback loop that encourages responsible behavior among participants.

### Solution Code
```python

    """

        round_number (int): Current round number.
        past_actions (list of lists): Each sublist contains actions ('C' or 'D') taken by all players in each previous round.
    
    Returns:
        str: 'C' for Cooperate, 'D' for Defect
    """
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate average defection rate across all past rounds and players
        total_defectors = sum([sum(1 for action in actions if action == 'D') for actions in past_actions])
        total_actions = len(past_actions) * len(past_actions[0])  # assuming same number of players each round
        avg_defection_rate = total_defectors / total_actions if total_actions != 0 else 0
        
        # Cooperate if current stock is below half capacity or if defection rate is high
        if current_stock < capacity / 2 or avg_defection_rate >= 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts with cooperation in the first round to ensure the resource isn't immediately depleted.
- **Stock Threshold Check**: If the current stock is below half of its capacity, players cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow recovery.
- **Defection Rate Analysis**: Players evaluate historical behavior by calculating the average defection rate. A high defection rate (50% or more) prompts cooperation to stabilize the resource level.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging responsible behavior among participants through adaptive decision-making based on current conditions and past actions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_121 = '''
To address the problem of balancing resource exploitation with sustainability in a repeated game setting, we propose a strategic approach that adapts to both current conditions and historical behavior. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while preventing a tragedy of the commons.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Round Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to establish a sustainable resource base.
2. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
3. **Penultimate Round Adjustment**: If nearing the end, cooperate only if the stock is sufficiently high; otherwise, defect.
4. **Middle Rounds Adaptation**:
   - Monitor others' recent actions to detect exploitation trends.
   - Cooperate if others are predominantly cooperative and the resource level is healthy.
   - Defect if excessive exploitation by others or low resource levels threaten sustainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, others_history):
    cooperation_threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # Example threshold
    defection_threshold = 0.5               # If >50% defect recently, defect
    
    if round_number == 1:

    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'

            if current_stock > cooperation_threshold:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            recent_defects = count_defects(others_history, window=5)
            proportion_D = recent_defects / len(others_history[-5:])
            
            if proportion_D > defection_threshold or current_stock < cooperation_threshold:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, the strategy promotes resource sustainability and mutual benefit.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Recognizing no future repercussions, defecting maximizes immediate gain.
- **Penultimate Adjustment**: A balance between maintaining resources for the final round if possible and exploiting when necessary.
- **Adaptive Behavior in Middle Rounds**: By monitoring others' actions and the resource level, the strategy dynamically adapts to prevent being exploited while sustaining the resource when beneficial.

This approach balances individual self-interest with collective sustainability, adapting to exploit opportunities while mitigating risks of resource depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_122 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource while responding to other players' actions, we can implement a dynamic strategy that adapts based on both the current state of the resource and recent cooperation trends among players.

### Approach
The approach involves:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to signal willingness to maintain sustainability.
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Use two thresholds for the stock level:
   - High threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
   - Low threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
3. **Recent Cooperation Rate**: Calculate the average proportion of Cooperators over recent rounds to gauge current cooperation levels.
4. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - If the stock is above the high threshold and recent cooperation is high, continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock is between thresholds, adjust based on moderate cooperation rates.
   - If the stock drops below the low threshold or cooperation rates are too low, switch to Defecting.

### Solution Code
```python
def decision_round(current_stock, capacity, n_players, previous_actions=None):
    if previous_actions is None:
        # First round: Cooperate
        return 'C'
    
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    recent_coop_rate = calculate_recent_coop_rate(previous_actions)
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        if recent_coop_rate >= 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    elif low_threshold <= current_stock <= high_threshold:
        if recent_coop_rate >= 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        # Stock below low threshold: Defect
        return 'D'

def calculate_recent_coop_rate(previous_actions):
    total_coop = sum(1 for round_act in previous_actions for act in round_act if act == 'C')
    total_players = len(previous_actions[0]) * len(previous_actions)
    return total_coop / total_players
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with Cooperate to encourage sustainability.
- **Thresholds**: Two thresholds (75% and 50% of capacity) help determine the resource's health. High cooperation is expected when the stock is robust.
- **Recent Cooperation Rate**: By analyzing recent actions, the strategy adapts to changing behaviors. If others Cooperate less, it becomes more likely to Defect.
- **Dynamic Response**: The approach dynamically adjusts between Cooperating and Defecting based on both resource levels and observed cooperation trends, balancing sustainability with responsiveness.

This strategy is designed to maintain a healthy stock level while adapting to the actions of other players, promoting a sustainable equilibrium.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_123 = '''
To address the problem, I propose a strategy that balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by monitoring both past actions and current stock levels. The strategy adapts based on observed cooperation rates and stock thresholds to encourage collective cooperation while defending against defectors.

---

**Strategy Description:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and sustain the resource.

2. **Adaptive Cooperation Based on Recent History:**
   - For each subsequent round:
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate among all players over the last 5 rounds (or fewer if less history is available).
     - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity AND the recent cooperation rate exceeds 60%, continue Cooperating.
     - Otherwise, switch to Defecting (D) to either salvage higher immediate payoffs or respond to perceived exploitation.

3. **Defection in Response to Low Stock:**
   - If the current stock falls below 80% of capacity, players prioritize maximizing their immediate payoff by defecting, anticipating potential resource depletion regardless of others' actions.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment to Cooperation Trends:**
   - Players continuously monitor cooperation rates and adjust their strategies accordingly, reinforcing collective behavior when sustainable and switching tactics when necessary.

---

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, capacity):
    n = number_of_players
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    lookback = min(5, len(history))
    total_cooperations = sum(1 for actions in history[-lookback:] for action in actions if action == 'C')
    cooperation_rate = total_cooperations / (n * lookback)
    
    capacity_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    
    if current_stock >= capacity_threshold and cooperation_rate > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

---

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate a cooperative environment.
- **Last Rounds (Unknown):** The strategy doesn't rely on knowing the end, focusing instead on current and past rounds to decide actions adaptively.

---

This strategy aims to sustain cooperation when viable while protecting against exploitation by defecting when necessary. By dynamically adjusting based on observed behavior and resource levels, it promotes collective stability while being resilient to various opponent strategies.

   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Rationale: Maintain or grow the stock by consuming less, encouraging others to do the same.
   - **Observation:** Note the number of players defecting and their impact on stock levels.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Cooperation Condition:**
     - Continue cooperating if most players have cooperated in previous rounds.
     - Rationale: Sustain resource levels for future gains.
   - **Defection Condition:**
     - Switch to defecting if a significant number of players (e.g., >50%) have defected in recent rounds.
     - Rationale: Prevent exploitation and maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Rationale: No future rounds to consider, so prioritize maximizing immediate gain.

4. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate if stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) or when majority cooperate.
   - Defect if stock is low, many defect, or near the end.

5. **Adaptation:**
   - Gradually adjust behavior based on recent outcomes and others' actions to prevent exploitation.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock_level, history):
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if near the end
    if round_number >= (total_rounds - 2):
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate in recent rounds
    recent_coop = sum(1 for action in history[-5:] if action == 'C') / len(history[-5:])
    
    # If majority recently cooperated, cooperate
    if recent_coop > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check stock level threshold
    if stock_level > 0.7 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to others' behavior and resource levels.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Strategy Overview:**
The strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting player behavior based on the current stock level and historical interactions. It encourages cooperation when sustainable and switches to defection when necessary to prevent resource depletion.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to maintain a healthy initial stock level, promoting future growth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to the maximum capacity.
   - If the stock is above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating to sustain high payoffs and encourage resource replenishment.
   - If the stock drops below 80%, consider switching to Defecting to maximize immediate gain while preventing further depletion.

3. **Final Rounds (Last Few Rounds):**
   - Tend towards Defection as there are fewer future rounds, reducing incentives for long-term cooperation.

**Adaptive Mechanisms:**

- **Threshold Adjustment:** Adjust the 80% threshold based on historical performance. If cooperation leads to stable stock levels and high payoffs, maintain or raise the threshold. If cooperation fails, lower the threshold to prevent depletion.
  
- **Buffer Zone:** Introduce a buffer around the threshold where players use a mixed strategy (random Cooperate/Defect) to handle uncertainty near the threshold.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Stock at Threshold:** Use the buffer zone for a smooth transition between cooperation and defection, avoiding abrupt changes.
- **Mixed Strategies:** When some players defect while others cooperate, adapt by adjusting thresholds and strategies dynamically to respond to varying player behaviors.

**Implementation Summary:**
The strategy adapts based on observable game state information, encouraging cooperation when sustainable and defecting when necessary. It uses feedback mechanisms to adjust thresholds and employs a buffer zone for smoother transitions, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors without requiring communication or coordination.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to balance individual payoffs with the collective good, ensuring sustainable use of the common pool resource. It is designed to adapt based on current stock levels and historical cooperation rates, promoting stability and recovery.

---

### **Strategy Overview**

1. **Cooperation Threshold:** Players Cooperate (C) when the current stock is above 75% of capacity, ensuring sustainable consumption and allowing for stock recovery.
2. **Adaptive Defection for Recovery:** When the stock falls below 75%, players may defect less aggressively to aid in recovery while still seeking some payoff.
3. **Learning from History:** Players adjust their strategies based on past cooperation rates observed among others, encouraging continued cooperation if sufficient numbers are doing so.

---

### **Detailed Strategy Components**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - All players Cooperate (C) to maintain the stock at its initial level and set a positive precedent for future rounds.

2. **Cooperation Threshold (75% of Capacity):**
   - If current stock > 0.75 × capacity:
     - Cooperate (C) to sustainably consume resources, allowing growth.
   - This ensures that when the resource is abundant, players contribute to its stability.

3. **Stock Below 75%:**
   - Players evaluate historical cooperation rates from previous rounds:
     - If cooperation rate among others was high in recent rounds:
       - Cooperate (C) to support stock recovery and maintain sustainability.
     - If cooperation rate was low:
       - Defect (D), but consider defecting less aggressively to avoid excessive depletion. This might involve a reduced consumption rate or cautious defection.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others to do the same, fostering a cooperative environment.
   - **Last Round:** Continue Cooperating to prevent a sudden collapse and ensure some payoff without over-depletion.

5. **Feedback Loop and History Adjustment:**
   - Players monitor past cooperation rates (e.g., proportion of Cs from other players) and adjust their strategy accordingly:
     - High cooperation in previous rounds reinforces current Cooperation.
     - Low cooperation may prompt more cautious behavior or limited Defection to prevent collapse.

6. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Consider trends in stock levels over multiple rounds. If the stock is increasing despite some Defectors, it signals that enough are Cooperating for recovery, allowing others to cautiously defect without harming sustainability.

---

### **Pseudocode Representation**

```python
for each player i in {1, ..., n}:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(history)
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
        # Cooperate when stock is above threshold
        return 'C'
    else:
        if cooperation_rate > threshold_coop_rate:
            # High cooperation observed; cooperate to support recovery
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Consider defecting less aggressively or cautiously defecting
            return 'D'  # Could be modified based on additional factors like stock trends
```

---

### **Conclusion**

This strategy promotes sustainability by Cooperating when the resource is abundant and adaptively adjusting behavior based on past cooperation rates. It encourages collective responsibility, helping to maintain the common pool resource while allowing players to secure reasonable payoffs. By balancing individual gains with long-term sustainability, this approach aims to achieve a stable equilibrium in the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_127 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on current stock levels, recent player behavior, and the number of rounds remaining. This approach ensures adaptability while promoting sustainability.

### Strategy Overview

The strategy is designed to foster cooperation when it's sustainable and switches to defection when necessary or nearing the end of the game. It uses observable state variables (stock level, past actions) to dynamically adjust each player's decision.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Rounds (First 5% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Reasoning:** Establish a healthy stock base to support sustainability and growth in subsequent rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds (Until the last 10% of rounds):**
   - **Step A:** Calculate the average cooperation rate from the past `k` rounds.
   - **Step B:** If the current stock is above 70% of capacity (`stock_threshold`) and the average cooperation rate is above 60% (`coop_threshold`), Cooperate.
   - **Else:** Defect
   - **Reasoning:** Continue supporting sustainability when others are cooperating and the resource is healthy. Switch to defection if cooperation levels drop or the resource is strained.

3. **Last 10% of Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Reasoning:** Maximize individual gains in the final rounds since future rounds no longer matter.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    if round_number <= initial_cooperate_rounds:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number > (total_rounds - endgame_defect_rounds):
        return 'D'
    else:
        recent_history = get_last_k_rounds(history, k)
        avg_coop = calculate_average_cooperation(recent_history)
        if current_stock / capacity >= stock_threshold and avg_coop >= coop_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Parameters
initial_cooperate_rounds = total_rounds * 0.05
endgame_defect_rounds = total_rounds * 0.10
k = 3  # Number of recent rounds to consider
stock_threshold = 0.7  # 70% of capacity
coop_threshold = 0.6   # 60% cooperation rate
```

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to start sustainably.
- **Low Stock:** If stock drops below the threshold despite attempts, players might defect cautiously to avoid collapse.
- **Endgame:** Focus on maximizing individual gains since future rounds are limited.

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset valuing long-term sustainability while remaining flexible.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_128 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability in a resource management scenario, we propose a strategic approach that adapts based on observed stock levels and others' actions. Here's the structured explanation:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff while maintaining the resource for future gains. It employs thresholds to decide between cooperation and defection based on the current state of the resource.

### Decision-Making Process:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone, encouraging others to follow suit and contribute to sustainable resource management.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1: Observe Stock Levels Post-Growth:**
     - After each round, note the new stock level after consumption and growth.
   
   - **Step 2: Evaluate Stock Against Thresholds:**
     - **High Threshold (e.g., ≥80% of capacity):** If the stock is above this threshold, continue Cooperating. The resource is sustainably managed, ensuring future gains.
     - **Moderate Levels (50%-80% of capacity):** Assess others' cooperation in the previous round:
       - If most players Cooperated, continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability.
       - If many Defected, consider switching to Defecting to avoid exploitation and maximize immediate payoff.
     - **Low Threshold (<50% of capacity):** Switch to Defecting. The resource is critically depleted; defecting maximizes immediate payoff before potential collapse.

3. **Final Round(s):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Even in the last round, cooperation ensures higher payoffs from potential growth before final consumption, benefiting all players collectively.

### Conclusion:
This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to the resource's state and others' behaviors. It promotes cooperation when resources are healthy and switches to defection when necessary to prevent over-depletion, ensuring a fair balance between individual and collective benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_129 = '''
**Dynamic Threshold Strategy (DyThS)**

This strategy adapts based on the remaining rounds and current stock level, encouraging cooperation for sustainability while switching to defection as resources dwindle or nearing the game's conclusion.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to start sustainably and build a stable resource base.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the proportion of the current stock relative to capacity.
   - Adjust cooperation thresholds based on the number of remaining rounds:
     - High threshold (75%) when more than half of the game remains.
     - Medium threshold (60%) as rounds progress into the middle third.
     - Low threshold (40%) in the final third of the game.

3. **Endgame Handling:**
   - In the last few rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoffs since there's no future benefit from cooperation.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, remaining_rounds, total_rounds):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if remaining_rounds == total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    prop = stock / capacity
    
    # Determine dynamic threshold based on remaining rounds
    if remaining_rounds > (2 * total_rounds) / 3:
        threshold = 0.75
    elif remaining_rounds > total_rounds / 3:
        threshold = 0.60
    else:
        threshold = 0.40
    
    # If in last few rounds, defect regardless
    if remaining_rounds <= 2:
        return 'D'
    
    if prop >= threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Strategy Explanation:

- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The strategy uses a sliding scale for cooperation thresholds. As the game progresses, players become more cautious, lowering their willingness to cooperate to prevent resource depletion.
  
- **Endgame Handling:** Recognizing that the final rounds offer no future benefits from sustainability, players defect to maximize immediate gains.

This approach balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and encouraging collective behavior that prevents over-depletion while maximizing individual payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_130 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with adaptive responses based on the state of the common pool resource and historical consumption patterns. This strategy is designed to promote sustainability while deterring excessive exploitation.

### Strategy Design:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Start with Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline and encourage sustainable resource use.

2. **Sustainability Threshold:**
   - Define a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) below which cooperation may not be sustainable.
   - Continue Cooperating if the stock remains above this threshold.

3. **Adaptive Defection for Conservation:**
   - If the stock falls below the threshold or shows rapid depletion, switch to Defect in subsequent rounds to signal the need for conservation and deter overconsumption.

4. **Reversion to Cooperation:**
   - After a period of defection, revert to Cooperate if stock levels recover, encouraging others to follow suit.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Consider defecting to maximize immediate payoff, but weigh against the risk of crashing the resource.
   - **Mid-Game Adjustment:** Continuously monitor trends and adjust actions based on current stock health.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_history, consumption_patterns):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    
    # Check if stock is below threshold or rapidly decreasing
    if (current_stock < threshold) or (is_rapidly_decreasing(stock_history)):
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Consider recent consumption patterns
        if many_defectors(consumption_patterns):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def is_rapidly_decreasing(stock_history):
    # Calculate rate of change over last few rounds
    pass

def many_defectors(consumption_patterns):
    # Determine if a significant number of players defected recently
    pass
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages others to maintain the resource, setting a positive precedent.
- **Threshold Monitoring:** Prevents stock depletion by signaling when conservation is needed.
- **Adaptive Defection:** Deters excessive exploitation while encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Reversion Mechanism:** Promotes long-term sustainability by reverting to cooperation once conditions improve.

This strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to both cooperative and defective behaviors of other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_131 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperate-Defect**

This strategy balances individual exploitation with collective resource maintenance by adjusting actions based on current stock levels and trends.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

Players decide to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) each round based on the following rules:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C). This helps maintain a high initial stock for future rounds.
   
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If current stock \( S > 0.8 \times \text{capacity} \): Defect (D) to exploit the abundant resource.
   - If current stock \( S < 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \): Cooperate (C) to allow regrowth and prevent collapse.
   - **Between thresholds (0.5–0.8 × capacity)**:
     - Check if the stock has decreased compared to two rounds ago.
     - If yes: Cooperate (C) to rebuild the resource.
     - If no: Defect (D) as the resource is stable or increasing.

3. **Last Round**: Always Defect (D). Since there are no future consequences, maximize individual gain.

---

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round**: Cooperation ensures a high starting stock.
- **Stock Near Capacity**: Defection is safe due to abundance.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Cooperation prevents collapse and enables regrowth.

---

### **3. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
threshold_low = 0.5 * capacity

for t in range(1, r + 1):
    if t == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock(t)
        if current_stock > threshold_high:
            action = 'D'
        elif current_stock < threshold_low:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            # Check trend compared to two rounds ago
            stock_two_rounds_ago = get_stock(t - 2)
            if current_stock < stock_two_rounds_ago:
                action = 'C'  # Cooperate to rebuild
            else:
                action = 'D'  # Defect as stable or increasing
    # Enforce defect in the last round
    if t == r:
        action = 'D'
    set_action(t, action)
```

---

### **4. Rationale**

- **Initial Cooperation**: Preserves the resource for future exploitation.
- **Defection at High Levels**: Maximizes individual gain when the resource is abundant and less likely to collapse.
- **Cooperation at Low Levels**: Prevents irreversible depletion, allowing the resource to recover.
- **Trend-Based Adjustment**: Responds dynamically to others' actions, switching strategies based on whether the stock is decreasing or stable.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_132 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**
Maximize total payoff over all rounds by balancing immediate gains with preserving the resource for future use, while adapting to opponents' behaviors.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Build a cooperative history and encourage others to do the same, fostering mutual preservation of the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate opponents' cooperation rate.
     - `opponent_coop_rate = (number of opponent Cooperations) / total_opponent_actions`
   - Determine current stock level relative to capacity.
   - Adjust actions based on thresholds:
     - If `opponent_coop_rate > threshold1` and `current_stock_level > safe_threshold`: Defect
     - Else: Cooperate

3. **Endgame (Last 10% of rounds):**
   - Gradually increase defection likelihood as future rounds matter less.
   - Adjust thresholds to allow more Defection towards the end.

4. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - `safe_threshold = capacity * 0.6`
     - If stock is above this, consider allowing limited Defection.
   - `danger_zone = capacity * 0.3`
     - Below this, enforce Cooperate to aid recovery.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

1. **First Round:**
   - Default to Cooperate as no history is available.

2. **Stock Near Capacity or Zero:**
   - If stock > `capacity * 0.8`: Allow cautious Defection.
   - If stock < `danger_zone`: Enforce Cooperate to prevent collapse.

3. **Last Few Rounds:**
   - Use a sliding scale where the likelihood of Defect increases as rounds near completion, balancing immediate gains with minimal future impact.

---

### **Pseudocode**

```python
def decision_rule(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, opponent_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate opponent cooperation rate
    total_opponent_actions = sum(len(actions) for actions in opponent_actions)
    if total_opponent_actions == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    opponent_coop_count = sum(1 for actions in opponent_actions for a in actions if a == 'C')
    opponent_coop_rate = opponent_coop_count / total_opponent_actions
    
    # Define thresholds
    safe_threshold = capacity * 0.6
    danger_zone = capacity * 0.3
    threshold1 = 0.75  # Cooperate rate needed to allow Defection
    
    # Endgame adjustment
    if round_number > (total_rounds - total_rounds // 10):
        endgame_weight = ((round_number - (total_rounds - total_rounds // 10)) / (total_rounds // 10)) * 0.5 + 0.5
        threshold1 *= endgame_weight
    
    # Decision logic
    if opponent_coop_rate > threshold1 and current_stock > safe_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

---

### **Rationale**

- **Building Cooperation:** Starting with Cooperate sets a positive precedent, encouraging others to preserve the resource.
- **Adaptability:** By adjusting based on opponents' cooperation rates and stock levels, the strategy dynamically balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability.
- **Risk Management:** Thresholds prevent over-exploitation, ensuring the resource remains viable for future rounds unless endgame dynamics justify more risk.

This approach aims to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining a sustainable resource level through adaptive cooperation and cautious defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_133 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining cooperation while avoiding over-depletion in a repeated resource game, we propose a threshold-based strategy that adapts based on observed stock levels. Here's a structured summary:

### Strategy: Threshold-Based Cooperation with Hysteresis

1. **Initialization**:
   - **State**: Begin in State A (Cooperate).
   - **Thresholds**:
     - Lower Threshold (X): 80% of capacity.
     - Upper Threshold (Y): 90% of capacity.
   - **Endgame Handling**: Defect in the last few rounds to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Decision Process for Each Round**:
   - If within the final 3 rounds, defect.
   - Else:
     - **State A (Cooperate)**:
       - Check if current stock (S) < X.
         - If yes: Switch to State B (Defect).
         - Else: Continue Cooperating.
     - **State B (Defect)**:
       - Check if S > Y.
         - If yes: Revert to State A (Cooperate).
         - Else: Continue Defecting.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Always Cooperate in the first round to set a positive precedent.
   - Handle stock exactly at X or Y by using inclusive checks.
   - If stock reaches zero, remain in Defect state until recovery above Y is observed.

### Rationale

- **Thresholds**: The thresholds (80% and 90%) provide clear decision points. Cooperating when the stock is high maintains sustainability, while defecting when it's low prevents over-depletion.
- **Hysteresis**: Prevents rapid state switches due to minor fluctuations near the thresholds, ensuring stability in strategy choice.
- **Endgame Handling**: Recognizes that cooperation is less likely in final rounds, so defecting maximizes short-term gain.

This approach balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, dynamically adapting to other players' actions without requiring communication. It encourages cooperation when possible and switches to defection when necessary, maintaining resilience against various player behaviors.

### Final Answer

The optimal strategy is a threshold-based approach where you cooperate if the current stock exceeds 80% of capacity and defect otherwise, with hysteresis to avoid oscillation. This strategy ensures sustainable resource use while adapting to others' actions. The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when the stock exceeds 80%, else defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_134 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability. The strategy is designed to be robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors while maximizing collective payoff over multiple rounds.

---

### **Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation and Defection (ACD)**

The ACD strategy adapts based on the current stock level, historical trends, and previous actions' outcomes. It prioritizes cooperation when the resource is at risk to ensure sustainability but allows defection when the resource is abundant or when other players' actions indicate a need for increased immediate payoff.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to conserve the resource and encourage others to follow suit.
   - Monitor stock dynamics and adjust subsequent decisions based on observed trends.

2. **Current Stock Thresholds:**
   - **High Stock (S > 0.8 * capacity):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as the resource is resilient and can recover even after high consumption.
   - **Medium Stock (0.4 * capacity < S ≤ 0.8 * capacity):** 
     - Cooperate if the stock has been decreasing over recent rounds or if previous rounds indicate high defection by others.
     - Defect otherwise, balancing immediate gains with sustainability concerns.
   - **Low Stock (S ≤ 0.4 * capacity):** Cooperate to preserve the resource and allow it to recover.

3. **Stock Trend Analysis:**
   - Track the stock's trend over the last few rounds.
   - If the stock is consistently decreasing despite cooperation, switch to cooperation in subsequent rounds to encourage recovery.
   - If the stock remains stable or increases after defection, continue defecting cautiously.

4. **Last Few Rounds (Final 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Gradually increase defection to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are limited.
   - Avoid excessive depletion that could reduce payoffs in the final round.

5. **Responsive Adjustment:**
   - If other players' actions lead to rapid stock depletion, switch to cooperation to mitigate further damage.
   - Adjust defecting levels based on observed trends in stock growth and consumption patterns.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()
    current_round = get_current_round()

    low_threshold = 0.4 * capacity
    medium_high = 0.8 * capacity
    
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate to set a positive precedent
    if current_round <= 2:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check stock level relative to thresholds
    if current_stock <= low_threshold:
        return 'C'  # Preserve resource for recovery
    elif current_stock > medium_high:

    # Medium stock: Analyze trend and previous actions

    if recent_stock_trend < -0.1 * capacity:  # Stock decreasing significantly

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to encourage others to conserve the resource.
- **Last Round(s):** Gradually increase defection to maximize immediate payoffs, but avoid excessive depletion that could harm the final round's payoff for everyone.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Feel confident in defecting as the resource is abundant and can recover even after high consumption.

---

### **Conclusion**

The ACD strategy dynamically adapts to current conditions, balancing cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection for immediate gains. By monitoring stock levels, analyzing trends, and responding to others' actions, this strategy aims to maximize collective payoff while ensuring the resource remains viable over multiple rounds. This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors and promotes a balance between individual and collective interests.

The optimal strategy for the AI in managing resource collection while considering potential depletion involves balancing between higher individual payoffs from defecting and preserving the resource by cooperating. Given the risk of immediate depletion when defecting at high stock levels, a cautious approach is recommended.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Assess Current Stock Level:** Evaluate the current stock level relative to its capacity.
2. **Set a Threshold:** Define a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) above which defecting is considered safe without causing rapid depletion.
3. **Decision Making:**
   - If the current stock is below the threshold, cooperate to preserve resources and allow growth.
   - If the stock is above the threshold, defect to gain higher payoffs while ensuring it doesn't lead to significant resource depletion.

**Answer:**

The AI should Cooperate when the current stock level is below a certain high threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) to prevent depletion and promote resource growth. When the stock is above this threshold, it can safely Defect to gain higher payoffs without risking severe resource decline. This balanced approach helps maintain sustainable resource levels while allowing for occasional increased gains.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock level is below 75% of capacity; otherwise, defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_136 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource level while maximizing individual payoff, we employ a threshold strategy based on the current stock level relative to capacity.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Observe Current Stock (S_t):** At each round, check the current stock level S_t.

2. **Set Threshold (T):** Define a threshold T as 75% of the capacity (e.g., T = 0.75 * capacity).

3. **Decision Rule:**
   - If S_t ≥ T, choose to Cooperate (C). This helps maintain sustainable resource levels.
   - If S_t < T, switch to Defecting (D). This is a protective measure to prevent overexploitation and potential crashes.

4. **Rationale:**
   - Cooperating when the stock is sufficient ensures moderate consumption and allows for regrowth, maintaining long-term sustainability.
   - Defecting when the stock is low prevents severe depletion, though it risks short-term gains in exchange for preserving some resource base.

**Answer:**

At each round, if the current stock is at least 75% of capacity, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect. This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by preventing overexploitation when resources are low.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock} \geq 0.75 \times \text{capacity, else Defect}}

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative-Defector (ACD)

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by balancing cooperation for sustainability and defection to prevent resource depletion.

**Parameters:**
- High Stock Threshold: 70% of capacity
- Moderate Stock Threshold: 30% of capacity
- Recent Rounds Considered: Last 2 rounds

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **High Stock (Stock > 70% capacity):** Cooperate unless more than half of the players in the last two rounds defected.
   - **Moderate Stock (30% < Stock ≤70% capacity):** Cooperate if at least 60% of players cooperated in the last two rounds; otherwise, Defect.
   - **Low Stock (Stock ≤30% capacity):** Tend to Defect. Cooperate only if all or nearly all players cooperated in the last round.

3. **Last Round (Round r):** Always Defect to maximize individual gain without concern for future rounds.

**Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Unilaterally Cooperate.
- **Last Round:** Unilaterally Defect.
- **Very Low Stock (Stock ≤30% capacity):** Default to Defecting more frequently, as cooperation may not prevent collapse.

**Adaptability and Responsiveness:**
- The strategy adapts by monitoring the stock level and recent player behavior. It adjusts between Cooperating and Defecting based on these factors.
- If opponents frequently defect, the strategy shifts towards defection to avoid being exploited.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```python
def decide_action(state, history):
    round_number = state['round']
    stock = state['stock']
    capacity = state['capacity']
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        high_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
        low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
        
        recent_history = history[-2:]  # Last two rounds
        coops_in_recent = sum(1 for h in recent_history if h['action'] == 'C')
        
        if stock > high_threshold:
            if coops_in_recent / (2*n) >= 0.5:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        elif low_threshold < stock <= high_threshold:
            if coops_in_recent / (2*n) >= 0.6:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:  # stock <= low_threshold
            if all(h['action'] == 'C' for h in recent_history):
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy starts with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base.
- It adjusts based on the current stock level and recent player actions, balancing between cooperation for long-term benefits and defection to avoid exploitation or resource collapse.
- By considering the last two rounds, it responds dynamically to changes in opponent behavior while maintaining adaptability to different game states.

description_COLLECTIVE_138 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that dynamically balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and historical player behavior. The strategy aims to sustain the common pool resource while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Players cooperate if the current stock is above an adaptive threshold; otherwise, they defect. The threshold adjusts each round based on historical cooperation rates and changes in stock levels.

2. **Historical Cooperation Factor**: Incorporates the average cooperation rate of all players from previous rounds to influence the threshold adjustment.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**: Cooperate in the first round by default. In the last few rounds, adjust thresholds higher to encourage sustainable consumption.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set an initial threshold `T` as a fraction (e.g., 80%) of the maximum capacity.
   - Define a historical cooperation rate (`H`) starting at 50% since there's no history initially.

2. **Each Round (t = 1 to r)**:
   - **Current Stock Check**: Determine the current stock level `S`.
   - **Adjust Threshold**:
     - Compute `adjusted_T` by adding a penalty based on historical cooperation rate: `adjusted_T = T + (1 - H) * adjustment_factor`. The adjustment factor could be a fraction of capacity, say 0.1 * capacity.
     - Ensure `adjusted_T` stays within reasonable bounds (e.g., between 50% and 100% of capacity).
   - **Decision**:
     - If `S >= adjusted_T`, cooperate; else, defect.
   - **Update Historical Cooperation Rate**: Track the proportion of cooperation actions across all players in this round to update `H` for future rounds.

3. **Stock Dynamics Adjustment**:
   - After each round, observe whether the stock increased or decreased and adjust `T` accordingly (e.g., increase `T` if stock decreases significantly).

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to start sustainably.
   - **Last Few Rounds**: Increase threshold to encourage cooperation and prevent endgame depletion.

### Pseudocode:

```python
Initialize:
    T = 0.8 * capacity  # Initial threshold at 80% of capacity
    H = 0.5             # Initial historical cooperation rate assumption
    adjustment_factor = 0.1 * capacity  # Factor to adjust threshold based on history

For each round in 1..r:
    S = current_stock()
    
    # Calculate adjusted threshold considering historical cooperation
    adjusted_T = T + (1 - H) * adjustment_factor
    # Ensure threshold doesn't go out of bounds
    if adjusted_T > capacity:
        adjusted_T = capacity
    elif adjusted_T < 0.5 * capacity:
        adjusted_T = 0.5 * capacity
    
    # Decision to Cooperate or Defect
    if S >= adjusted_T:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        action = 'D'
    
    # Update historical cooperation rate based on current round's actions
    coop_actions = count of all players' C in this round
    H_new = (H * (t-1) + (coop_actions / n)) / t  # Moving average update
    
    # Adjust T based on stock change for next round
    if S > previous_stock:
        T *= 0.95  # Lower threshold slightly if stock increased
    else:
        T *= 1.05  # Increase threshold if stock decreased
        
    H = H_new  # Update historical rate for next iteration

# Edge Cases Handling
if t == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round by default
elif t >= r - 2:  # Last few rounds, adjust to encourage cooperation
    adjusted_T += 0.2 * capacity  # Higher threshold to prevent depletion
```

### Rationale:

- **Dynamic Threshold**: Adjusts based on both current stock and historical behavior, promoting cooperation when sustainable and encouraging conservation when necessary.
  
- **Incorporating History**: Uses the average cooperation rate to penalize or reward cooperation dynamically, fostering alignment among players without communication.

- **Edge Cases**: Ensures stable initial conditions and prevents endgame overexploitation by adjusting thresholds in final rounds.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive, robust against various opponent behaviors, and aligned with collective sustainability goals.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_139 = '''
The strategy "Adaptive Equilibrium" is designed to balance cooperation and defection in the Common Pool Resource Game, ensuring sustainable resource use while adapting to opponents' behaviors. Here's how it works:

### Strategy: Adaptive Equilibrium

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Starting with cooperation helps maintain a healthy stock level for future rounds, preventing immediate over-consumption.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If the current stock is above 90% of an adjusted capacity, Cooperate.
     - Otherwise, Defect.
   - **Adjusted Capacity Calculation:** 
     - Compute prior consumption as a fraction of total possible consumption across all rounds. This helps gauge how much of the resource has been used up in previous rounds.
   - **Threshold Calculation:**
     - The threshold is set to 90% of the adjusted capacity, ensuring that cooperation occurs only when the stock is sufficiently high to support it without risking depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Since there are no future rounds left, players maximize their immediate payoff by defecting.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, prior_consumption, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate adjusted capacity considering prior consumption
        adjusted_capacity = capacity * (1 - prior_consumption / (total_rounds * n))
        threshold = 0.9 * adjusted_capacity
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Key Considerations

- **Sustainability:** Starting with cooperation in the first round ensures that the resource pool remains healthy, supporting future growth.
- **Adaptability:** By monitoring both current stock levels and past consumption, the strategy adapts to different opponent behaviors without relying on coordination or communication.
- **Threshold Adjustment:** The 90% threshold acts as a buffer, preventing over-depletion while allowing for some flexibility in response to varying conditions.

This approach optimizes collective payoff by balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against a wide range of opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_140 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior and stock dynamics. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Promotes sustainable resource management and sets a positive precedent.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Dynamics:** Track the stock level after each round to assess sustainability.
   - **Adaptive Thresholds:**
     - **Upper Threshold:** If the stock is above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating (C) as it indicates sustainable growth.
     - **Lower Threshold:** If the stock drops below 40% of capacity, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate gains before potential resource depletion.

3. **Adjustment Based on Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Use historical consumption data to identify trends:
     - **High Cooperation:** Continue Cooperating if the stock remains stable or grows.
     - **Significant Defection:** Increase defection frequency to prevent exploitation and protect against rapid resource decline.

4. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on how well cooperation is maintaining the stock. If cooperation isn't effective, shift towards more defection.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round (Round r):** If the stock is high, Cooperate to maintain sustainability; if low, Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Stock Near Capacity:** Cooperate to encourage growth.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Consider defecting if recovery seems unlikely.

This strategy aims to foster cooperation when beneficial while adapting to exploit when necessary, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term resource sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_141 = '''
**Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperative Play**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to establish a baseline of sustainable play.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Use dynamic thresholds relative to the game's capacity:
     - High Threshold: 75% of capacity
     - Medium Threshold: 50% of capacity
     - Low Threshold: 25% of capacity

3. **Decision Rules Based on Current Stock (S):**
   - **If S > High Threshold (0.75 * capacity):**
     - Cooperate to sustain stock and encourage others.
   - **If Medium < S ≤ High:**
     - Evaluate recent history (last few rounds).
     - If less than 30% of actions were Defects, Cooperate; else, Defect.
   - **If Low < S ≤ Medium:**
     - Consider a mixed approach:
       - If recent defects exceed half the players, Defect; otherwise, Cooperate.
   - **If S ≤ Low (0.25 * capacity):**
     - Defect to maximize immediate payoff as stock is near collapse.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to build a sustainable base.
   - **Final Rounds:** Adjust based on remaining stock:
     - High stock: Cooperate to sustain.
     - Low stock: Defect more to capitalize before depletion.

5. **Feedback and Adaptation:**
   - Continuously assess recent history to adjust cooperation levels, balancing immediate gains with future sustainability.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, n, capacity, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        high = 0.75 * capacity
        medium = 0.5 * capacity
        low = 0.25 * capacity
        
        if current_stock > high:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock > medium:
            recent = get_last_few_rounds(history, rounds=3)
            defect_ratio = count_defects(recent) / len(recent)
            return 'C' if defect_ratio < 0.3 else 'D'
        elif current_stock > low:
            recent_defects = count_defects(get_last_few_rounds(history, rounds=5))
            return 'D' if recent_defects > n/2 else 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy prioritizes maintaining cooperation when the stock is healthy to sustain growth.
- It adapts by observing recent behavior; if others defect, it reciprocates to prevent exploitation.
- Dynamic thresholds ensure flexibility across different game parameters, balancing immediate and future payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_142 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize long-term payoffs while adapting to player behavior and game dynamics. Here's a structured summary:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - *Reasoning:* Starts with cooperation to preserve the stock and build a positive history.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-10% of total rounds):**
   - **Conditions for Cooperation:**
     - Stock level is above 75% of capacity.
     - At least 60% of players cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Action if Conditions Met:** Cooperate
     - *Reasoning:* Sustains the resource and encourages collective preservation.
   - **Else:**
     - **Action:** Defect
       - *Reasoning:* Maximizes immediate payoff when cooperation is failing or the stock is threatened.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - *Reasoning:* Focuses on maximizing immediate gains as future rounds are negligible.

4. **Adjustments:**
   - Monitor previous payoffs and stock levels to refine cooperation-defection decisions.
   - If defecting yields higher payoffs without severe depletion, continue defecting.
   - Maintain cooperation if it sustains the resource and prevents collapse.

### Rationale

- **Long-term Sustainability:** Prioritizes cooperation in early rounds to build a healthy stock for future gains.
- **Adaptability:** Adjusts based on player behavior and stock dynamics, encouraging cooperation when viable and defecting when necessary.
- **Responsiveness:** Uses historical data to dynamically adapt, ensuring the strategy remains effective against various opponent strategies.

This approach balances individual gain with collective preservation, adapting to different game phases and player behaviors for robust performance.

To address the challenge of balancing immediate payoffs with future sustainability in a cooperative setting, we propose an adaptive strategy that encourages cooperation under favorable conditions and allows defection when necessary.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to preserve the resource and encourage others to follow suit, setting a foundation for sustainable collaboration.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Observation:** Assess the proportion of players who cooperated in the immediately preceding round.
   - **Current Stock Check:** Evaluate the current stock level as a percentage of capacity.
   - **Decision Making:**
     - If both the cooperation rate is above 70% and the stock is above 80%, continue to cooperate to maintain high resource levels.
     - If either the cooperation rate drops below 70% or the stock falls below 80%, switch to defecting. This action aims to maximize immediate gains while signaling dissatisfaction with low cooperation.

3. **Threshold Adjustments:**
   - The required cooperation threshold decreases when the stock is healthy, promoting leniency.
   - Conversely, a higher cooperation threshold is enforced when the stock is low, encouraging more players to cooperate to prevent collapse.

4. **Final Round Consideration:** In the last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff since future considerations are irrelevant.

### Conclusion:

This strategy balances current gains with future sustainability by adapting to others' actions and the resource's state. It promotes cooperation when beneficial and allows defection when necessary, fostering a resilient approach to resource management.

3. **Endgame Defection**: In the final 25% of total rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate payoffs with minimal concern for future depletions.

### Decision Rules:
- **Round 1**: Cooperate.
- **Rounds 2 to r - (0.25r)**:
   - If current stock > 80% of capacity and increasing compared to two rounds prior: Cooperate.
   - Else: Defect.
- **Last 25% Rounds**: Always Defect.

To address the problem of balancing immediate gains against long-term sustainability in a resource management scenario, we propose a strategic approach that considers current stock levels, others' behavior, and the game's progression. This strategy is encapsulated in the following decision-making framework:

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round (t=1):**
   - Always Cooperate to encourage sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   a. Calculate the average cooperation rate from previous rounds.
      - Determine how many players have been Cooperating on average.
   b. Assess the current stock level:
      - If below 40% of capacity, classify as 'Low' and Cooperate.
      - If above 60%, classify as 'High'; otherwise, it's 'Medium'.
   c. Decide action based on stock level and cooperation rate:
      - For 'Low' stock: Cooperate to rebuild resources.
      - For 'Medium' or 'High' stock: Cooperate if others are mostly Cooperating (above 60%); else, Defect.

3. **Last Few Rounds (t >= r - last_round_buffer):**
   a. If stock is low, Cooperate to prevent further depletion.
   b. If stock is high, Defect to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds do not matter.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- In the first round, always start with Cooperation.
- In the last few rounds, adjust actions based on whether resources are scarce or abundant.
- If the stock collapses to zero, subsequent decisions default to Defecting as there's no recovery possible.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(t, r, n, capacity, current_stock, history):
    if t == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        total_coop = sum(1 for round in history for action in round['actions'] if action == 'C')
        avg_coop = total_coop / (n * (t - 1))
        
        # Determine stock level category
        low_threshold = 0.4 * capacity
        high_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
        
        if current_stock <= low_threshold:
            s_level = 'Low'
        elif current_stock >= high_threshold:
            s_level = 'High'
        else:
            s_level = 'Medium'
        
        # Check proximity to last rounds
        last_round_buffer = max(1, int(r * 0.1))
        if t >= r - last_round_buffer + 1:

                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

            cooperation_threshold = 0.6
            if s_level == 'Low':

                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy effectively balances the need for immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on current conditions and others' behavior. It promotes Cooperation when resources are scarce to rebuild them, allows Defection when resources are abundant and others are Cooperating, and adjusts tactics in the final rounds to maximize payoffs while considering future impacts.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy for balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability involves dynamically adjusting actions based on current stock levels, the cooperation rate of other players, and the game's progression. Here is a concise summary:

- **Start by Cooperating:** In the first round, always Cooperate to encourage sustainable resource management.
- **Assess Stock Levels:** For subsequent rounds, classify the current stock as Low (below 40%), Medium, or High (above 60% of capacity).
  - If Low, Cooperate to rebuild resources.
  - If Medium or High:
    - Cooperate if more than 60% of previous actions were Cooperative.
    - Otherwise, Defect.
- **Adjust in Final Rounds:** In the last 10% of rounds, Cooperate if stock is low; otherwise, Defect.

This strategy ensures that resources are preserved when necessary while allowing for higher immediate payoffs when safe. It adapts to others' behavior and the game's progression, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It adapts based on the current stock level, others' recent actions, and the game's progression.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage a cooperative environment and preserve the resource for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - The current stock is below 75% of capacity, indicating a need to prevent further depletion.
     - A significant number of players have been defecting in recent rounds, suggesting the resource may be at risk.
   - **Defect** if:
     - The current stock is above 75% of capacity, allowing for safe extraction without depleting the resource too much.
     - Many players have been Cooperating recently, indicating it's safe to take more without causing a crash.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = get_capacity()
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        threshold = capacity * 0.75  # Adjust as needed
        recent_coop_count = count_cooperation(history, last_k_rounds=5)
        
        if stock_level < threshold or recent_coop_count <= n / 2:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold (75% of capacity) is a heuristic to balance extraction and sustainability. It can be adjusted based on empirical testing.
- **Recent Cooperation Check:** By monitoring recent cooperation, the strategy adapts to changes in others' behavior, encouraging mutual cooperation when needed.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** The strategy dynamically switches between Cooperate and Defect based on current conditions, promoting long-term resource health while allowing for strategic gains.

This approach ensures that the player maximizes their payoff while contributing to the collective good by maintaining a sustainable resource level.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and stock health. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. Initial Round
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Starting with C signals willingness to share, potentially encouraging others to cooperate and preserve the resource for future rounds.

### 2. Subsequent Rounds
- **Monitor Cooperation Levels:**
  - Track each player's actions over previous rounds.
  - Calculate the percentage of times other players have cooperated.

- **Adaptive Threshold Approach:**
  - If more than a certain threshold (e.g., 60%) of other players cooperate, continue to Cooperate (C).
  - If cooperation drops below this threshold, switch to Defect (D) to prevent being exploited and conserve remaining resources.

### 3. Stock Health Check
- **High Stock Levels:**
  - Continue Cooperating (C) if stock is high and growing sustainably.
  
- **Low or Declining Stock:**
  - Consider defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as the resource may not recover adequately for future rounds.

### 4. Anticipation of Endgame
- **Last Round Handling:**
  - Expect all players to Defect (D), so adjust strategy accordingly in the penultimate round to mitigate losses.
  
- **Final Round Strategy:**
  - Switch to D to maximize immediate payoff, recognizing no future rounds remain.

### 5. Robustness and Adaptability
- **Adaptation to Changing Strategies:**
  - Stay vigilant to shifts in other players' behaviors, adjusting cooperation levels as needed without overreacting to short-term changes.
  
- **Smoothing Factor:**
  - Use a smoothing factor when updating cooperation metrics to maintain stability and avoid abrupt strategy shifts.

### Pseudocode Outline
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history_of_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate cooperation rate of others
        cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(history_of_actions)
        
        # Check stock health
        if stock_level < threshold_stock:
            return 'D'
        elif cooperation_rate > cooperation_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

def handle_last_round():
    return 'D'

def main():
    for round in 1 to r:
        if round == r:
            action = handle_last_round()
        else:
            action = decide_action(round, stock_level, history_of_actions)
        execute(action)

main()
```

### Conclusion
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to others' behaviors and the state of the resource. It encourages cooperation when beneficial but switches to defection to prevent exploitation or resource collapse, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_148 = '''
The strategy involves balancing cooperation with defection based on the current stock level and inferred behavior of other players. Here's a clear breakdown:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage a healthy resource base.

2. **Dynamic Threshold for Action**:
   - Set an initial threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
   - In each round, if the stock is above this threshold, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.
   
3. **Adaptation Based on Past Behavior**:
   - After each round, adjust the threshold based on how much the stock changed. If the stock grew despite significant consumption, it suggests others are Cooperating, so keep or raise the threshold. If the stock dropped, infer more Defectors and lower the threshold.

4. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last few rounds, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains as there's no future benefit in sustainability.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def strategy(round_number, remaining_rounds, current_stock, history):
    capacity = 100  # Example value; adjust based on actual parameters
    initial_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold = initial_threshold

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Adjust threshold based on previous rounds' stock changes
    if history:  # If there is past data
        last_stock_change = current_stock - history[-1]['stock_after']
        if last_stock_change > 0:
            threshold *= 1.05  # Encourage more cooperation if stock grew
        else:
            threshold *= 0.95  # Discourage cooperation if stock dropped
    
    if remaining_rounds <= 3:  # Last few rounds, defect to maximize payoff
        return 'D'
    
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy adapts dynamically, encouraging cooperation when the resource is healthy and switching to defection when necessary, balancing individual gain with collective sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_149 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Sustainability**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a cooperative foundation.
   - **Middle Rounds (2 to r-1)**:
     - Monitor the last m rounds' actions (e.g., 5 rounds) and current stock level.
     - If more than 70% of all player actions were Cooperations and the stock is above 80% of capacity, Cooperate.
     - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate payoff and prevent over-depletion.
   - **Last Round (r)**: Always Defect, as there's no future round for retaliation.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Stock Near Zero**: Automatically Defect, as the resource is nearly depleted.
   - **Initial Cooperation**: Encourage sustainable use by starting with C.

3. **Collective Mindset**:
   - Focus on maintaining a healthy stock level to sustain long-term payoffs.
   - Adaptively switch to defecting when cooperation isn't mutually beneficial or when the resource is at risk of collapse.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation when it benefits everyone and defecting when necessary. It adapts dynamically based on observed behavior and resource health, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Check recent history (last m rounds) for cooperation proportion
        m = 5  # Number of past rounds to consider
        start_index = max(0, len(history) - m)
        recent_history = history[start_index:]
        
        total_players = len(recent_history[0]) if recent_history else 1
        cooperation_count = sum(action == 'C' for round_actions in recent_history for action in round_actions)
        proportion_cooperate = cooperation_count / (total_players * len(recent_history))
        
        # Check stock level against threshold
        safe_threshold = capacity * 0.8
        if proportion_cooperate > 0.7 and current_stock >= safe_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

This strategy ensures that players contribute to maintaining a sustainable resource while protecting their interests in the face of potential exploitation or inevitable depletion in the final round.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_150 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable system where players can either Cooperate or Defect based on the current stock level, we propose the following strategy. This approach balances between sustaining the resource when it's abundant and allowing players to take more when it's scarce, while also considering the risk of collapse if the stock drops too low.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Monitor Current Stock:** At each decision point, assess the current level of the shared resource (stock) relative to its maximum capacity.

2. **Set Thresholds:** Establish a threshold at 75% of the maximum capacity. This serves as the dividing line between Cooperating and Defecting.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - **If Current Stock > 75%:** Players should Cooperate. This ensures that the resource is sustainably managed, allowing for growth and preventing rapid depletion.
   - **If Current Stock ≤ 75%:** Players should Defect. By taking more when the stock is lower, players can secure their share before potential collapse.

4. **Considerations:**
   - **Sustainability When Abundant:** Cooperating when the stock is high maintains a balance and prevents unnecessary depletion.
   - **Mitigating Collapse Risks:** Allowing Defection when the stock drops below 75% can help prevent the resource from being completely exhausted, as players take necessary measures to secure their needs.

**Final Strategy:**

Cooperate if the current stock exceeds 75% of the maximum capacity; otherwise, defect. This strategy balances sustainability with practical resource management, addressing both abundance and scarcity scenarios effectively.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock > 75\%; else, defect}}$

**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while maintaining a sustainable resource pool through adaptive cooperation and defection based on current conditions and historical behavior.

---

### **Strategy Overview**

The strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by adapting to the stock level and other players' actions. It starts with cooperation, transitions based on thresholds and historical data, and defects in later rounds to maximize payoff.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Encourages others to cooperate by setting a positive example.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Check Current Stock (S):**
     - If S ≥ 70% of capacity and more than half of players cooperated in the previous round:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - Preserves the resource, allowing growth for future rounds.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - Maximizes immediate payoff when cooperation is ineffective or stock is low.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Round r-2 to Round r):**
   - As rounds approach the end, prioritize defecting if possible.
     - **Action:** If S > 0, defect to exploit remaining resource without concern for future depletion.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **Stock at Capacity:**
  - Cooperate to maintain high stock and encourage others to do the same.
- **Stock Near Depletion (S approaching 0):**
  - Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as the resource will not recover significantly.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decision_rule(current_stock, capacity, cooperation_history):
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    recent_coop_rate = sum(cooperation_history[-5:]) / len(cooperation_history[-5:]) if len(cooperation_history) >=5 else 1

    # First round: cooperate
    if not cooperation_history:
        return 'C'
    
    # Last few rounds: defect if possible
    if current_round > r - 2:
        return 'D' if current_stock > 0 else 'C'
    
    # Main decision logic
    if current_stock >= threshold and recent_coop_rate > 0.5:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage in each round
for round in rounds:
    action = decision_rule(stock, capacity, cooperation_history)
    record_action(action)
```

---

### **Rationale**

- **Cooperation Threshold (70%):** Balances preservation and growth of the resource with acceptable consumption levels.
- **Recent Cooperation Rate:** Adapts to changing player behaviors. If more than half cooperate, it's safer to join in to avoid exploitation.
- **Endgame Defection:** Maximizes payoff in final rounds without worrying about future depletions.

This strategy is robust, adaptive, and aligns with collective sustainability goals while protecting against exploitation.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

Our strategy balances cooperation with defecting based on stock levels and game progression. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same, setting a positive precedent.

2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Cooperate as long as:
   - The current stock is above 75% of capacity.
   - There are more than three rounds remaining.

3. **Defecting Conditions**:
   - Switch to defecting when in the last three rounds, maximizing immediate payoff with no future considerations.
   - If the stock drops below 25% of capacity, defect to exploit remaining resources before potential depletion.

4. **Adaptive Adjustments**: Lower the cooperation threshold if observing a higher rate of defecting by others, ensuring it doesn't fall below 50% of capacity to prevent rapid resource collapse.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage mutual cooperation.
- **Last Three Rounds**: Defect to maximize immediate gains without regard for future rounds.

This strategy adapts dynamically, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary or advantageous, balancing between long-term sustainability and short-term gains.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Cooperative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to encourage cooperation while adapting to opponents' behavior, ensuring sustainable stock levels for maximum total payoff. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial Play (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reasoning: Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent and helps maintain a stable stock level early on.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Decision Rule:** Cooperate if:
     - The current stock is above a threshold (e.g., half the capacity).
     - In the previous rounds, most players were Cooperating.
   - **Defect Condition:** Defect (D) if:
     - The current stock is below the threshold.
     - A significant proportion of players have been defecting in recent rounds.

3. **Later Rounds:**
   - **Action Adjustment:** Maintain cooperation to preserve the stock unless a large number of players are defecting, which may justify defecting temporarily.
     - Reasoning: Avoiding a crash ensures long-term sustainability and higher total payoff.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C).
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Continue Cooperating to maintain stock stability, even though defecting might yield higher immediate gains. This prevents a sudden crash in the final rounds.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```plaintext
function decide_action(round_number, current_stock, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return C

            return C
        else:
            return D
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy starts with cooperation to encourage a sustainable stock.
- It adapts by observing others' actions, continuing to cooperate if the majority does so and the stock is healthy.
- If many defect or the stock is low, it switches to defection temporarily.
- This balance aims to maximize total payoff while preventing stock crashes.

The designed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is an adaptive, collective approach aimed at balancing immediate payoffs with long-term resource sustainability. Here's a structured overview of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Decision Rule Based on Stock Level:**
   - Cooperate if the current stock is below a dynamically adjusted threshold.
   - Defect otherwise.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Start with an initial threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity).
   - Adjust the threshold based on past growth rates and consumption trends:
     - Increase the threshold if stock consistently remains above target, indicating robustness.
     - Decrease it if stock falls below target, signaling the need for conservation.

3. **Early Rounds Emphasize Cooperation:**
   - In the first few rounds, lean towards cooperation to build a resource buffer, ensuring sustainable growth in subsequent rounds.

4. **Adaptation Near Game End:**
   - As rounds approach the end (last 10%), shift strategy towards defection since future considerations are less critical.

5. **Monitoring and Adjustment:**
   - Track past actions and cooperation levels to adjust strategies dynamically.
   - Use a weighted average of current stock and recent trends to inform decisions, ensuring adaptability without excessive complexity.

### Summary

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation thresholds based on observed resource conditions and past performance. It encourages collective behavior through simple rules that can be independently applied by each player, fostering a sustainable use of the common pool resource without relying on explicit coordination or assumptions about others' strategies beyond observable actions.

The strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to the game's dynamics and other players' behaviors. Here is a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** If the stock level is above a critical threshold (e.g., half of capacity) and a majority of players cooperated in recent rounds.
   - **Defect (D):** If the stock is below the critical threshold or if cooperation rates have been low, indicating potential exploitation.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Default to Cooperate to encourage a stable start.
   - **Last Round:** Consider defecting, but maintain cooperation if it promotes higher overall payoffs and resource sustainability.

3. **Adaptive Mechanism:**
   - Use historical data on cooperation rates to adjust thresholds dynamically. If past rounds show high defection, be more cautious in future decisions.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to set a positive precedent and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Assess Stock Level:** Check if the current stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., half of capacity).
     - If yes, proceed to check cooperation history.
     - If no, defect to conserve resources.
   - **Evaluate Cooperation History:** Look at the proportion of cooperators in recent rounds.
     - If the majority cooperated, continue cooperating.
     - If cooperation was low, defect to prevent being exploited.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Adjust the critical threshold and required cooperation rate based on historical performance and stock dynamics observed in previous rounds.

4. **Last Round Consideration:**
   - While tempted to defect, consider the potential for higher payoffs through continued cooperation and its impact on long-term sustainability.

### Rationale:
- Cooperating when others do so maintains a stable stock level, ensuring sustainable growth and higher payoffs over time.
- Defecting when necessary prevents resource depletion, protecting against exploitation by defectors and conserving resources for future rounds.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while promoting collective sustainability, adapting dynamically to game conditions and other players' behaviors.

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while maintaining the common pool's sustainability through adaptive behavior based on current stock levels and recent cooperation rates.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Initial move to encourage sustainability and observe others' behavior.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   a. Calculate the current stock level, S.
   b. Determine the proportion of Cooperators in the past k rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds).
   c. If:
      - S ≥ S_thr (e.g., capacity * 0.6)
      - AND cooperation rate > y% (e.g., 70%)
     - **Action:** Cooperate
   d. Else:
      - **Action:** Defect

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Maximize immediate payoff as there's no future impact.

---

### **Parameters**

- **S_thr:** Threshold stock level, e.g., 60% of capacity.
- **k:** Number of recent rounds to consider for cooperation rate (e.g., 3).
- **y%:** Minimum cooperation rate required to Cooperate (e.g., 70%).

---

### **Rationale**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Promotes sustainability and provides a basis for mutual cooperation among players.
- **Adaptive Behavior:** Switches between Cooperating and Defecting based on the resource's health and others' actions, preventing over-depletion while exploiting when necessary.
- **Final Round Defection:** Ensures maximum payoff in the last round without worrying about future consequences.

---

### **Example Scenario**

- **Round 1:** All players Cooperate. Stock remains at capacity.
- **Round 2:** Some defect. If stock is above S_thr (60%), and cooperation rate is high (70%), continue Cooperating.
- **Round 3:** More defecting. Cooperation rate drops below threshold. Switch to Defect.
- **Round 4:** Stock dips below S_thr. Continue Defecting.
- **Round 5 (Last):** Defect regardless of stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If the current stock is above a threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity), continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoffs.

3. **Final Few Rounds (Last 2-5 rounds):**
   - **Adjustment:** Gradually shift towards more Defecting as the game nears its end to prioritize current gains over future payoffs.

4. **Edge Cases and Considerations:**
   - **Rapid Depletion:** If many players defect early, switch to D preemptively to salvage payoffs.
   - **Perfect Information:** Use historical data to anticipate trends and adjust strategies accordingly.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_158 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock Levels**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Early Rounds:** Cooperate if the stock is above 75% of capacity. This promotes sustainability and keeps the resource replenishing.
   - **Mid Game:** If the stock drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 25%), switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs as others may be exploiting the common pool.
   - **Late Rounds:** Always Defect in the last few rounds to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future replenishment.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate since the stock is at capacity, ensuring a sustainable start.
   - **Low Stock Situations:** If the stock drops below 25%, immediately switch to Defecting to prevent being left with nothing as others exploit the resource.
   - **Endgame (Last Few Rounds):** Always Defect to maximize payoffs, as future rounds are minimal or non-existent.

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   The strategy aligns with a collective approach by initially promoting cooperation for sustainability. However, it adaptively switches to defecting when necessary, ensuring individual payoff maximization without relying on others' cooperation, thus balancing between collective benefit and self-interest.

**Pseudocode:**

```

- early_rounds = first 1/3 of total rounds
- late_rounds_start = last 2/5 of total rounds
- high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
- low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity

description_COLLECTIVE_159 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource while maximizing individual gains over multiple rounds, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on observed behavior and current stock levels. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players choose to Cooperate (C). This action starts sustainably, maintaining the resource at its maximum capacity for future rounds.

2. **Adaptive Play in Subsequent Rounds:**
   - For each subsequent round, each player evaluates two factors:
     a) The proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round.
     b) The current stock level relative to a predefined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).

3. **Decision Rules Based on Previous Cooperation:**
   - If more than half of the players Cooperated in the previous round, continue Cooperating this round. This reinforces sustainable behavior and maintains trust among participants.
   - If less than or equal to half of the players Cooperated, consider defecting (D). However, this decision is also influenced by the current stock level.

4. **Stock Level Threshold Check:**
   - Even if cooperation was low in the previous round, continue Cooperating if the current stock level remains above a certain threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity). This helps prevent over-depletion and ensures that the resource can recover.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, players switch to Defecting. This action is taken as a protective measure against potential collapse and reflects a strategic response to sustain individual gains.

5. **Behavior in Final Rounds:**
   - In the last round (round r), all players choose to Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds left, maximizing immediate gain becomes the priority.
   - In the second-to-last round (round r-1), players anticipate that others will defect in the final round. Therefore, they may also choose to Defect in round r-1 to maximize their gains before the resource is depleted.

6. **Edge Cases and Considerations:**
   - If cooperation rates are consistently high and the stock remains stable above the threshold, continued cooperation sustains the resource.
   - If cooperation rates drop significantly despite a healthy stock level, players might switch to defecting, potentially leading to a collapse of the resource in subsequent rounds.

By following this strategy, players balance between sustaining the resource through cooperation when feasible and defecting strategically to prevent over-depletion or capitalize on others' actions. This approach aims to maximize individual gains while promoting collective sustainability for as long as possible.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a balanced strategy that prioritizes long-term sustainability while adapting to other players' actions. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Sustainability Checks

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first few rounds to build up the stock and promote sustainability.

2. **Sustainability Monitoring**: Continuously track a sustainability metric, such as the change in stock levels over successive rounds. This metric helps determine if cooperation is effective or if defectors are causing over-depletion.

3. **Defection Thresholds**: If the sustainability metric falls below a predetermined threshold (indicating unsustainability), switch to defecting for a limited period. This action signals the need for adjustment and reduces personal losses from others' defection.

4. **Reassessment and Adaptation**: After switching to defection, reassess the sustainability metric. If it improves, return to cooperation. If not, consider further adaptation or continued defection.

5. **Final Rounds Adjustment**: In the last few rounds, defect more frequently since future payoffs are irrelevant, maximizing short-term gains without affecting long-term sustainability.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_history, opponent_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate sustainability metric
    sustainability = calculate_sustainability(stock_history)
    
    if sustainability > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Check if previous rounds were defective
        recent_defections = count_defections(opponent_actions, last_n_rounds=5)
        if recent_defections > defect_threshold:
            return 'D'  # Defect to signal and adjust
        else:
            return 'C'  # Continue cooperation
    
    # In final rounds, prioritize personal gain
    if round_number >= r - final_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
def calculate_sustainability(stock_history):
    # Example: Calculate change in stock over time
    recent_stock = stock_history[-window_size:]
    avg_change = (recent_stock[-1] - recent_stock[0]) / window_size
    return avg_change

# Threshold and parameters can be tuned based on initial tests
threshold = 0.8 * capacity  # Example threshold
defect_threshold = 3        # Number of defects to trigger switch
final_rounds = 3            # Rounds near the end where defection is prioritized
window_size = 5             # Number of rounds considered for sustainability metric
```

### Conclusion

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource health, adapting dynamically to other players' behaviors. By using clear thresholds and reassessment mechanisms, it encourages cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection when necessary, fostering a collective approach to sustain the common pool effectively.

description_COLLECTIVE_161 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation and defection in a shared-resource setting, we propose a strategy that adapts based on the observed health of the resource (stock). The goal is to sustain cooperation while protecting against over-exploitation.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Observation Phase:** Each player observes the current stock level relative to the maximum capacity.
2. **Threshold Check:** If the stock is above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating (C). This promotes sustainable use and maintains resource levels.
3. **Defection Trigger:** If the stock drops below 80%, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate gain while minimizing further depletion caused by others' actions.
4. **Dynamic Adaptation:** By focusing on the current stock, the strategy adapts to changes without requiring communication or knowledge of others' strategies.

**Answer:**

Each player employs a threshold-based strategy:

- Cooperate if the current stock is above 80% of capacity.
- Defect otherwise.

This approach ensures sustainable resource use while allowing players to respond to signs of over-exploitation by others.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock > 80\% of capacity; else, defect.}}

description_COLLECTIVE_162 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a resource management game, we propose a cooperative-defection strategy that adapts based on current stock levels and historical cooperation rates. The strategy is designed to encourage cooperation when it benefits all players and switch to defection when necessary to prevent over-depletion.

### Approach
The strategy involves the following key components:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Players start by cooperating in the initial rounds to build up the resource stock, encouraging others to do the same.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: In subsequent rounds, players decide whether to cooperate or defect based on a dynamically adjusted threshold of the current stock relative to capacity and the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
3. **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment**: The threshold decreases over time as fewer rounds remain, reflecting the reduced incentive to preserve resources for an uncertain future.
4. **Majority Influence**: Players consider the cooperation rate of others from the previous round, using it as a factor in their current decision to cooperate or defect.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(S_current, capacity, remaining_rounds, total_rounds, prev_coop_rate):
    """
    Determines whether to Cooperate or Defect based on current stock (S_current),
    capacity, remaining rounds, total rounds, and the previous round's cooperation rate.
    
    Parameters:
        S_current: float - Current stock level
        capacity: float - Maximum possible stock level
        remaining_rounds: int - Number of rounds left including the current one
        total_rounds: int - Total number of rounds in the game
        prev_coop_rate: float - Proportion of players who Cooperated last round
        
    Returns:
        'Cooperate' or 'Defect'
    """
    # Calculate the threshold based on remaining rounds
    threshold = max(0.5, 0.75 * (remaining_rounds / total_rounds))
    
    # Determine cooperation decision
    if S_current > capacity * threshold and prev_coop_rate > 0.6:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with players cooperating to build a healthy resource stock, fostering an environment where mutual cooperation is beneficial.
2. **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold for deciding whether to cooperate decreases as the game progresses, encouraging more defection towards the end when future rounds are less valuable. This adjustment ensures that players balance immediate gains against long-term sustainability effectively.
3. **Stock Check**: Players check if the current stock level exceeds the dynamically adjusted threshold. A higher threshold in early rounds promotes cooperation to maintain resource health, while a lower threshold near the end allows for more defection as future benefits diminish.
4. **Cooperation Rate Influence**: By considering the previous round's cooperation rate, players are incentivized to cooperate when others are also cooperating, reinforcing collective action and maintaining higher stock levels.

This approach ensures that players adapt their strategies dynamically, responding to both current resource conditions and historical behavior patterns to achieve a balance between immediate gains and sustainable resource management.

description_COLLECTIVE_163 = '''
To design a robust and adaptive strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability by monitoring the stock level. The strategy is as follows:

### Strategy Overview:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage sustainable resource use.
- **Threshold-Based Adaptation:** Adjust actions based on the stock level relative to a threshold (80% of capacity).
- **Dynamic Response:** Continue Cooperating if the stock remains above the threshold; switch to Defecting if it drops below, signaling overuse.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Initiate with cooperation to support resource sustainability and observe other players' actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Assess Stock Level:**
     - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
       - **Rationale:** Maintain sustainable consumption, allowing the resource to regenerate.
     - If the current stock is at or below 80% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
       - **Rationale:** Respond to overuse by maximizing immediate gains while signaling the need for adjustment.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level each round.
   - Use past trends to dynamically adjust thresholds if necessary, preventing oscillations and ensuring adaptability to varying player behaviors.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Default to Cooperate as no prior information is available.
- **Last Rounds (if known):** Consider defecting more to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds. However, in the given problem with finite rounds but unknown end, treat all rounds similarly unless dynamically adjusted.

### Example Scenarios:
- **All Cooperate:** Stock remains stable, strategy continues to Cooperate.
- **Some Defect:** If stock drops below threshold, switch to Defecting, potentially leading others to adjust, fostering recovery if cooperation resumes.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by reacting adaptively to the observed state of the resource, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_164 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining sustainable cooperation among players in an iterated game where defection leads to resource depletion, we propose a collective strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term stability.

**Strategy Overview:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by cooperating to establish a stable resource base and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Monitor Cooperation Levels:** Track the proportion of players who cooperate in each round. If cooperation is prevalent, continue to cooperate; if not, switch to defecting to signal disapproval or protect against exploitation.
3. **Adapt Based on Resource Health:** Use the current stock level as an indicator of sustainable behavior. When resources are healthy (above a threshold), be more forgiving and maintain cooperation. If resources drop significantly, lower the threshold for switching to defection to prevent further depletion.
4. **Late Game Adjustment:** As the end of the game approaches, slightly increase the tendency to defect to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited.

**Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a positive precedent and build a stable resource foundation.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
  - If this proportion exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%), continue cooperating.
  - If it falls below the threshold, switch to defecting to either encourage others to cooperate or protect against further resource depletion.
- **Stock Level Adjustment:** Before deciding based on cooperation rates, check if the current stock is significantly lower than capacity. If so, adjust thresholds to make it easier to defect in response to over-consumption.
- **Late Game Strategy:** In the last 10% of rounds, increase the tendency to defect slightly to capitalize on immediate gains as future rounds are limited.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Default to Cooperate to foster a cooperative environment from the start.
- **Last Rounds Adjustment:** Acknowledge that in the final stages, maximizing current payoffs is more critical since there's no future benefit to lose.
- **Stock Depletion:** If resources drop critically low, even if others cooperate, consider defecting more aggressively to prevent further losses and incentivize others to revert to cooperation.

**Collective Mindset:**

The strategy aims to encourage collective cooperation by rewarding it with sustainable resource levels and punishing defection through strategic responses. By mirroring the majority action when possible and adapting based on stock health, it seeks to maintain a balance that prevents over-depletion while allowing for mutual gains.

This approach ensures that players contribute to long-term sustainability while remaining vigilant against exploitation, fostering an environment where cooperation thrives unless challenged by significant defection.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{C}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_165 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation in a repeated game with potential defection, we propose a strategy that combines initial trust-building, monitoring of others' actions, and adaptive responses to maintain sustainability.

**Strategy Outline:**

1. **Initial Cooperation (Trust-Building Phase):**
   - Cooperate for the first two rounds to establish a cooperative environment and observe others' behavior without immediate pressure.

2. **Monitoring Phase:**
   - After each round, record the number of players who Defected (chose D) in that round.
   - Calculate the defection rate as the proportion of Defectors relative to the total number of players.

3. **Adaptive Response Based on Defection Trends:**
   - If, over the last three consecutive rounds, more than half of the players (including yourself) have Defected each time:
     a. Switch to a Tit-for-Tat approach for the next two rounds.
     b. In this phase, mirror the previous round's actions of the majority or punish those who Defected by also defecting in the following round.

4. **Defensive Phase:**
   - If the stock level drops below 80% of capacity, prioritize maintaining Cooperation to allow for regrowth:
     a. Cooperate if the defection rate is low (below 20%), encouraging others to do the same.
     b. If the defection rate remains high despite low stock levels, continue using Tit-for-Tat to signal disapproval and encourage a return to Cooperation.

5. **Hysteresis Effect:**
   - To prevent rapid oscillations between strategies, require a significant improvement in cooperation before switching back:
     - Only revert to full Cooperation if the defection rate drops below 10% for two consecutive rounds after exiting Tit-for-Tat mode.

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Establishes a baseline of trust and allows players to observe each other's behavior without immediate pressure.
- **Monitoring Phase:** Enables detection of trends in defection rates, crucial for timely adaptation.
- **Tit-for-Tat Approach:** Encourages mutual cooperation by rewarding Cooperators and punishing Defectors, helping to stabilize behavior.
- **Defensive Phase:** Prioritizes stock health to prevent crashes, balancing between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.
- **Hysteresis Effect:** Prevents instability caused by rapid strategy switches due to minor fluctuations in defection rates.

This strategy aims to maintain a stable equilibrium where Cooperation is sustained through mutual rewards and controlled responses to Defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_166 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances immediate payoffs with future sustainability. This strategy dynamically adjusts based on the current stock level and historical trends, encouraging cooperation while penalizing excessive defection through resource depletion.

### Strategy Description:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start by cooperating to promote a healthy initial stock.
   - Set an initial threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) to gauge when to shift strategies based on the stock's state.

2. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate:** If the average recent stock level is above the threshold, continue cooperating to maintain or increase resource levels.
   - **Defect:** If the stock falls below the threshold, switch to defecting to signal the need for others to cooperate and prevent further depletion.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Increase the threshold slightly if cooperation leads to sustained growth, encouraging more future cooperation.
   - Decrease the threshold if defection causes resource decline, signaling a shift towards more defection until cooperation is restored.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a positive tone and encourage others to do the same.
   - **Final Rounds (Last 5%):** Gradually increase defection likelihood as future punishment for bad behavior diminishes, focusing on maximizing immediate payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(historical_stock, current_round, total_rounds):
    capacity = get_capacity()
    threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    recent_history_length = min(5, len(historical_stock))
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    if current_round > total_rounds - (total_rounds * 0.05):
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate average stock over the last few rounds
    recent_stocks = historical_stock[-recent_history_length:]
    avg_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
    
    if avg_stock > threshold:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        action = 'D'
    
    # Adjust threshold based on growth
    last_stock = historical_stock[-1]
    current_after = get_current_stock_after()
    total_consumption = sum(get_actions())
    stock_after_consumption = last_stock - total_consumption
    growth = current_after - stock_after_consumption
    
    if action == 'C' and growth > 0:
        threshold *= 1.01
    elif action == 'D' and growth <= 0:
        threshold *= 0.99
    
    return action
```

### Explanation:

- **Cooperation Signal:** By starting with cooperation, the strategy promotes resource sustainability and sets a positive precedent for other players.
- **Dynamic Thresholding:** Adjusting thresholds based on recent stock trends ensures adaptability to changing conditions, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Special considerations for initial and final rounds ensure optimal short-term gains while preserving long-term sustainability.

This strategy aims to create a balance where cooperation is rewarded with sustainable payoffs, while defection leads to resource depletion, incentivizing all players towards collective resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_167 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for all players, we analyze the game dynamics:

1. **Cooperation Stability**: If all players cooperate (C), each receives 12.5 per round, and resources remain stable at 100.

2. **Defection Temptation**: Defecting (D) in a single round gives 25 instead of 12.5, but it reduces future resources, leading to lower payoffs for everyone, including the defector.

3. **Nash Equilibrium Consideration**: Always Cooperating isn't a Nash equilibrium because defecting offers higher immediate payoff when others Cooperate.

4. **Repeated Game Strategy**: In repeated games, players can use strategies that punish defection (e.g., defecting forever after any defection), which deters initial defections by making future payoffs worse for all.

5. **Collective Benefit of Cooperation**: Despite the temptation to defect, sustained cooperation maximizes long-term payoffs as it preserves resource levels, ensuring consistent higher returns each round.

**Answer:** All players should choose C (Cooperate) every round to sustain maximum long-term benefits.

$\boxed{C}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_168 = '''
**Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C) to promote a healthy stock and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Stock Level Check:**
     - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock is between 20% and 80%, assess the proportion of defectors in recent rounds:
       - If fewer than 30% of players Defected in previous rounds, Cooperate.
       - If 30% or more Defected, switch to Defecting (D).
     - If the stock drops below 20%, start defecting to maximize immediate gains before potential depletion.

3. **Final Rounds:**
   - As we approach the last few rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds), increase the tendency to Defect, especially if the stock is low, as there's no future punishment for over-consumption.

4. **Edge Cases and Considerations:**
   - Use dynamic thresholds based on observed behavior and game parameters.
   - Smooth transitions between Cooperate and Defect actions by averaging defection rates over multiple rounds to prevent oscillations.
   - Be cautious in games with higher numbers of players, as each defection's impact varies but collectively can deplete the stock significantly.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to current stock levels and recent player behavior. It avoids relying on others' specific strategies beyond observable actions, ensuring robustness across different game conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_169 = '''
**Final Answer:**

To design a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that maximizes total payoff while encouraging sustainability, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players Cooperate (C) to maintain the stock at its capacity level, ensuring sustainable growth and consistent payoffs.

2. **Cooperation Tracking**: Monitor the number of players who Cooperated in each previous round. If more than half of the players consistently Cooperate (e.g., over 50% in the last three rounds), continue Cooperating to sustain the stock.

3. **Defection Punishment**: If a player Defected (D) in the immediately preceding round, respond by defecting in the current round to punish them. After punishment, revert to Cooperate if they start Cooperating again.

4. **Stock Sustainability Check**: Each round, check if the stock is below 30% of capacity. If it is, all players should Defect temporarily for one round to allow the stock to recover. Return to Cooperate in subsequent rounds once the stock recovers above this threshold.

5. **Final Rounds Handling**: In the last few rounds (approximately the final 5% of total rounds), if the majority have been Cooperating throughout the game, all players should continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability and avoid a rush to defect for higher payoffs.

**Implementation Steps:**

- Track cooperation history for each player.
- Assess stock health each round using the threshold.
- Apply conditional actions based on previous rounds' outcomes and current stock level.

This strategy balances individual incentives with collective sustainability by using clear, adaptive rules that respond to players' behavior and the state of the common pool.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_170 = '''
To address the problem of designing a strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a threshold-based adaptive strategy that balances immediate and future payoffs while considering the behavior of other players. The strategy is designed to be robust, responsive to stock levels, and aligned with collective sustainability.

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Rounds**: Start by Cooperating when the stock is at or near capacity. This promotes sustainable resource management and allows for growth.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - **High Threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity)**: Cooperate to maintain a healthy stock level and encourage mutual sustainability.
   - **Middle Range (e.g., between 70% and 90%)**: Implement a mixed strategy where cooperation is the default, but consider defecting if there's significant defection by others in previous rounds. This helps prevent over-depletion while signaling the need for caution.
   - **Low Threshold (e.g., below 70%)**: Switch to Defecting to salvage remaining resources and avoid further depletion.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - After each round, adjust thresholds based on the number of players who Defected and the impact on stock levels. If defection is prevalent and causing rapid depletion, lower the high threshold or adjust behavior accordingly.
   - Use historical data to predict future trends and adapt thresholds dynamically.

4. **Final Rounds**: In later rounds, prioritize immediate payoff by defecting if the stock is low. However, maintain cooperation if possible to sustain higher payoffs and prevent complete resource depletion.

5. **Memory Component**: Remember how many players have Defected in recent rounds and adjust behavior to respond to potential cascades of defection without causing instability.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, history, current_round):
    n = number_of_players()
    r = total_rounds()

    # Initialize thresholds
    high_threshold = 0.9 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.7 * capacity

    # Adjust thresholds based on historical behavior and stock dynamics
    if stock > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif low_threshold <= stock <= high_threshold:
        # Mixed strategy: Cooperate most times but occasionally Defect
        num_defectors_last_round = sum(history[-1]['actions'] == 'D')
        if num_defectors_last_round / n >= 0.5:
            return 'D'  # Defect if more than half defected last round
        else:
            return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

    # Additional considerations for final rounds
    if current_round > r - 5:  # Last few rounds
        if stock < low_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Thresholds**: The strategy uses dynamic thresholds to decide between Cooperating and Defecting. High cooperation at high stock levels encourages sustainability, while defecting at lower levels prevents resource depletion.
- **Mixed Strategy in Middle Range**: By occasionally defecting when others do, the strategy signals the need for caution without causing instability.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: The strategy adapts thresholds based on historical data and current trends to respond effectively to changing conditions.
- **Final Rounds Consideration**: Ensures that even towards the end of the game, cooperation is maintained if beneficial, preventing complete resource collapse.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adaptively responding to other players' behaviors while promoting collective cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_171 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a stable stock level while maximizing individual payoffs without communication, we propose a strategy that incorporates feedback from recent rounds and employs thresholds to balance between cooperation and defection. The strategy is designed to prevent crashes by encouraging cooperation when necessary and defecting cautiously.

**Strategy:**

1. **First Round:** Cooperate to start gently.
2. **Last Round:** Defect to maximize individual payoff since there's no future round for retaliation.
3. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - The current stock level \( S \) is below 50% of the capacity.
     - In the last round, more than half of the players defected (to encourage rebuilding).
   - **Defect** otherwise.

This strategy aims to prevent crashes by promoting cooperation when the stock is low or after a round with many defections. It also allows defecting when the stock is sufficiently high and recent rounds have shown sustained cooperation.

**Example Walkthrough:**

- **Round 1:** All players Cooperate.
  - Stock \( S = 100 \).
  - Each C consumes \( 12.5 \), total T = 50.
  - Stock after consumption: 50.
  - Growth: 50, new stock \( S' = 100 \).

- **Round 2:** Since \( S = 100 > 50\% \) and last round had no defections, all Defect.
  - T = 100, Stock after consumption: 0.
  - Growth: 0, new stock \( S' = 0 \).

- **Round 3:** Since \( S = 0 < 50\% \), all Cooperate.
  - No change; stock remains 0.

This example highlights a potential flaw where the strategy leads to a crash. To mitigate this, further adjustments might be needed, such as avoiding defection when the stock is near capacity or incorporating more sophisticated feedback mechanisms.

**Final Answer:**

The strategy balances cooperation and defection based on current stock levels and recent player behavior to prevent crashes while maximizing individual payoffs. It is defined as:

- Cooperate in the first round.
- Defect in the last round.
- Cooperate if the current stock is below 50% or more than half defected last round; otherwise, defect.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock < 50% or previous round had majority defection; else defect}}

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by cooperating in the first few rounds to help maintain or grow the stock, fostering a cooperative environment.

2. **Adaptive Defection:**
   - Monitor the current stock level and the proportion of cooperators from previous rounds.
   - If the stock is above 75% of capacity and more than half of other players are defecting, switch to defecting for higher immediate payoffs.

3. **Cooperation on Decline:** If the stock falls below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity) or shows signs of depletion, revert to cooperation to prevent further collapse and allow the resource to recover.

4. **Endgame Defection:** In the last two rounds, defect fully as there are no future rounds to consider, maximizing immediate payoffs.

### Decision Rules:
- **Cooperate** in the first round.
- For each subsequent round:
  - If stock > 75% capacity and >50% of other players defected last round: **Defect.**
  - Else: **Cooperate.**
- In the last two rounds: **Always Defect.**

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **High Stock (Above 75%):** Safe to defect if others are doing so, leveraging high resource availability.
- **Low Stock (Below 25%):** Critical to cooperate to prevent collapse and allow recovery.
- **Trend Analysis:** If stock is decreasing despite cooperation, consider adjusting thresholds to encourage more cooperation.

### Implementation:
The strategy dynamically adjusts based on current conditions, ensuring adaptability without relying on coordination with other players. It balances immediate gains against long-term resource sustainability, aiming for an optimal payoff over the game's duration.

The proposed strategy is designed to maximize collective and individual payoffs by balancing cooperation and defection based on the current state of the stock and historical cooperation rates. Here's a structured overview:

### Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT)

#### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate over the past `k` rounds (e.g., 5 rounds).
   - If the current stock is above a target level (e.g., 75% of capacity) and the recent cooperation rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%), Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect.

#### Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to build trust.
- **Last Round**: Cooperate to maintain sustainability; if others defect, it prevents rapid depletion.
- **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), consider Defecting more frequently unless others are Cooperating significantly.

#### Dynamic Adjustments:
- After each round, update the target stock level based on observed growth. If the stock increases despite cooperation, lower the threshold for defection.
- If cooperation leads to decreasing stock, it indicates high defect rates; adjust thresholds accordingly.

### Pseudocode Outline:

                avg_coop = 1.0  # Assume all Cooperate if no history

            # Check current stock and cooperation rate
            if S[t] > target_stock and avg_coop >= threshold_coop_rate:
                action_i[t] = Cooperate
            else:
                action_i[t] = Defect

        # Record action for future reference
        coop_history.append(1 if action_i[t] == Cooperate else 0)

    After all rounds, update target_stock based on observed trends.

```

### Explanation:

- **Adaptive Cooperation**: The strategy adapts by observing the cooperation rate and adjusting actions to either sustain the resource or maximize individual gain when others defect.
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Dynamically adjusts thresholds based on the stock's health, ensuring sustainability while preventing over-exploitation.
- **Edge Case Management**: Handles first and last rounds with specific rules to encourage trust and prevent depletion.

This strategy aims to foster a balance between collective resource management and individual payoff maximization.

description_COLLECTIVE_174 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock Sustainability**

1. **Initial Cooperate Phase:**
   - In the first round, default to cooperation (C). This helps maintain a higher stock level, promoting sustainable growth.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Calculate a dynamic threshold based on the initial capacity and observed trends in stock levels.
   - If the current stock is above this threshold, continue cooperating to sustain resource growth.
   - Below the threshold, switch to defecting (D) to secure immediate payoffs and prevent further depletion.

3. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Track stock levels over rounds. Use historical data to assess whether cooperation is leading to sustainable outcomes or if defection is becoming prevalent among opponents.

4. **Sustainability Check:**
   - After each round, evaluate if the current stock level indicates that cooperation is still beneficial. This involves calculating potential future gains from sustained cooperation versus immediate gains from defecting.

5. **Defect Response to Low Stock:**
   - If the stock drops significantly (below a predetermined percentage of initial capacity), defect to prevent further resource collapse and maximize short-term payoff.

6. **No Fixed Rounds Consideration:**
   - Since rounds are not fixed, focus on the state of the stock rather than round numbers. Adjust strategies dynamically based on current and past stock levels.

7. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to promote a healthy initial resource base.
   - **Significantly Low Stock:** Defect to prevent further depletion and secure immediate gains.
   - **Near Capacity Stock:** Cooperate to encourage sustainable growth for future rounds.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
for each player:
    threshold = capacity * 0.8  # Adjust based on game dynamics

    if current_round == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        stock_history = get_stock_levels()
        sustainability_trend = calculate_trend(stock_history)
        
        if current_stock > threshold and sustainability_trend is positive:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'

    return action
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to the game's state and opponent behaviors without requiring communication. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection when necessary to prevent resource collapse.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_175 = '''
To address the problem of determining whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round, we can employ a heuristic-based strategy that considers both the historical cooperation rates of other players and the current state of the shared resource (stock). The strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - In the first round, choose to Cooperate (C) to encourage a cooperative environment.

2. **Monitor Previous Rounds:**
   - For each subsequent round, review the actions of other players in the last few rounds (e.g., the previous 5 rounds).
   - Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated during this period.

3. **Assess Stock Health:**
   - Track the current stock level relative to its capacity.
   - Define thresholds:
     - **High Stock Threshold:** e.g., 80% of capacity.
     - **Low Stock Threshold:** e.g., 60% of capacity.

4. **Determine Action Based on Conditions:**
   - If the stock is above the High Stock Threshold and a significant majority (e.g., more than 70%) of players Cooperated in recent rounds, continue to Cooperate.
   - If the stock is below the Low Stock Threshold or if there has been a consistent pattern of Defectors causing the stock to decline, switch to Defecting to secure higher immediate payoffs and prevent further resource depletion.
   - Consider adjusting actions dynamically based on whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable.

5. **Endgame Adjustment:**
   - As the total number of rounds progresses towards its conclusion (e.g., in the last 10% of rounds), increase the tendency to Defect to capitalize on remaining resources before they are depleted.

**Answer:**

To determine whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round, follow this strategy:

- **Early Rounds:** Start by Cooperating to foster a cooperative environment.
- **Middle Rounds:** Continue Cooperating if most players have been Cooperating and the stock remains healthy. Switch to Defecting if there are many Defectors causing stock depletion.
- **Endgame:** Near the end of the rounds, increase the tendency to Defect to maximize immediate gains.

This approach balances cooperation with self-interest based on observed behavior and resource status, aiming for optimal outcomes in both short-term gains and long-term sustainability. 

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if most players have been Cooperating and the stock is healthy; otherwise, Defect.}}

description_COLLECTIVE_176 = '''
To address the problem of sustaining a shared resource while maximizing individual payoffs in a repeated interaction setting, we can devise a strategic approach that balances cooperation with defection based on observed behavior and current resource levels. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Step 1: Initial Cooperation
- **Action:** Cooperate in the first round.
- **Reasoning:** Starting with cooperation helps establish a baseline of contribution to the shared resource, encouraging others to follow suit.

### Step 2: Monitor Past Behavior
- **Action:** Track the number of Defectors (D_prev) from the previous round.
- **Reasoning:** Observing how many players defected in the last round provides insight into their potential strategies and the current state of cooperation.

### Step 3: Assess Proportion of Defectors
- **Action:** Calculate the proportion of Defectors, p = D_prev / n, where n is the total number of players.
- **Reasoning:** This step helps determine whether a significant portion of the group has shifted towards defection, which could indicate a potential breakdown in cooperation.

### Step 4: Evaluate Resource Health
- **Action:** Check if the current stock level (S_current) is below a predetermined threshold_stock (e.g., 75% of capacity).
- **Reasoning:** Monitoring the resource's health ensures that it remains sustainable. If the stock drops too low, continued cooperation may not be feasible without risking further depletion.

### Step 5: Decision-Making
- **Action:**
  - If p > threshold_defect (e.g., 0.5) OR S_current < threshold_stock:
    - Defect in the current round.
  - Else:
    - Cooperate.
- **Reasoning:** Switching to defection when either too many others are defecting or the resource is critically low serves as a protective measure against exploitation and potential crash of the shared resource.

### Step 6: Adaptation
- **Action:** Periodically reassess thresholds (e.g., threshold_defect, threshold_stock) based on historical data and observed trends in cooperation and resource levels.
- **Reasoning:** Adjusting strategies dynamically allows for better alignment with changing conditions and other players' behaviors over time.

### Example Application:
Consider a scenario with 4 players (n=4), capacity=100, starting stock=100.

- **Round 1:**
  - All Cooperate.
  - Stock remains at 100 after consumption and growth.
  
- **Round 2:**
  - Suppose 2 Defectors and 2 Cooperators.
  - p = 2/4 = 0.5, which meets the threshold_defect of 0.5.
  - Current stock=62.5 (from previous example).
  - Since p >= 0.5 OR stock < 75% capacity:
    - Decide to Defect.

- **Round 3:**
  - If again 2C/2D, stock drops further.
  - Re-evaluate based on updated p and S_current.

### Conclusion:
By strategically balancing cooperation with defection based on observed behavior and resource levels, this approach aims to sustain the shared resource while maximizing individual payoffs over time. Adjusting thresholds dynamically allows for flexibility in adapting to evolving conditions within the group.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_177 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategy where players cooperate by default but defect in response to observed defection. This approach aims to sustain the resource while penalizing those who overconsume. Here's how it works:

### Strategy Steps

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with cooperation in the first round to maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Monitor Consumption**:
   - After each round, calculate the expected consumption if everyone cooperated.
   - Estimate actual consumption based on the change in stock.

3. **Detect Defection**:
   - If actual consumption exceeds expected levels by a threshold, it indicates defection by some players.

4. **Adjust Strategy**:
   - Upon detecting defection, switch to defecting for subsequent rounds.
   - Continue monitoring until cooperation is restored or the resource collapses.

### Final Answer

The strategy involves defaulting to cooperation and switching to defection when evidence of overconsumption is detected. This encourages sustainable use while penalizing those who exploit the resource excessively. The approach is summarized as:

- **First Round**: Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If last round's consumption was higher than expected under cooperation, defect this round.
  - Otherwise, continue cooperating.

Thus, the optimal strategy is encapsulated as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; defect upon detecting overconsumption}}

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategic approach that balances sustainability with maximizing individual payoffs. The strategy adapts to the game's state and players' behaviors dynamically, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Rounds**: Begin by cooperating to maintain the stock at capacity, fostering trust among players.
2. **Monitor Trends**: Track stock levels and cooperation rates to assess sustainability and others' behavior.
3. **Adaptive Actions**:
   - **Cooperate** if the stock is above 70% of capacity and over 75% of other players cooperated recently.
   - **Defect** if the stock drops below 50% or there's significant defection, signaling unsustainability.
4. **Endgame Strategy**: Increase defection in the last few rounds to capitalize on immediate gains as future consequences diminish.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate unconditionally to support a sustainable start.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the current stock relative to capacity.
   - Determine the cooperation rate among other players from recent rounds.
   - If the stock is above 70% and most others cooperate, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock drops below thresholds or cooperation rates fall, switch to defecting.
3. **Final Rounds**: Increase defection tendency as future rounds' impact diminishes.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
function decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock, capacity, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return C
    
    cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(history)
    stock_threshold_high = 0.7 * capacity
    stock_threshold_low = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if stock > stock_threshold_high and cooperation_rate > 0.75:
        return C
    elif stock < stock_threshold_low or cooperation_rate < 0.25:
        return D
    else:
        # Adjust based on remaining rounds
        if (total_rounds - round_number) <= 0.1 * total_rounds:
            return D with higher probability
        else:
            return C
    
function calculate_cooperation_rate(history):
    recent_rounds = last_5_rounds(history)
    cooperation_count = sum(player_actions == 'C' for actions in recent_rounds for player_actions in actions)
    return cooperation_count / (n_players * len(recent_rounds))
```

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round**: Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
- **Last Rounds**: Increase defection as future consequences are less significant.
- **Stock Collapse**: If stock drops critically, consider defecting to maximize immediate gains.

This strategy aims to sustain the resource while adapting to others' behaviors and game dynamics, ensuring a balance between cooperation and individual payoff maximization.

description_COLLECTIVE_179 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to promote sustainable cooperation while adaptively responding to potential defection. Here's a structured summary of the approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating (C) to encourage others to do the same, fostering a sustainable resource base.
2. **Adaptive Response:** Monitor the stock's state after each round. If consumption exceeds a threshold (indicating possible defection), reduce cooperation in subsequent rounds.
3. **Endgame Adjustment:** Gradually shift towards more Defection (D) in the last few rounds to balance short-term gains without causing resource collapse.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Default action is Cooperate (C).
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If stock remains above 0.8 × capacity after a round, continue Cooperating.
  - If stock drops below this threshold, adjust future actions towards Defecting based on the severity of overconsumption.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Last Few Rounds:** Increase tendency to Defect as rounds near the end, balancing immediate gains with sustainability.
- **Stock Collapse:** If the resource is nearly depleted, switch to Defecting to maximize remaining payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_history, opponent_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        previous_stock = stock_history[-2]
        current_stock = stock_history[-1]
        consumption = previous_stock - (current_stock + growth)
        
        if consumption < threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            defect_prob = min(1, (consumption - threshold) / max_consumption)
            return random.choices(['D', 'C'], weights=[defect_prob, 1-defect_prob])[0]
```

### Summary:
This strategy balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with adaptive responses to potential defection. By monitoring the stock's health and adjusting actions accordingly, it promotes a stable resource base while allowing players to optimize their payoffs without complete collapse. The approach is robust against various opponent behaviors and ensures adaptability across different game dynamics.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperative-Defection Based on Stock Levels and Opponent Behavior**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - Start by Cooperating (C) in the first few rounds to encourage a healthy stock level and build a cooperative environment.

2. **Monitoring Mechanisms:**
   - Track the stock level after each round.
   - Observe the proportion of Defect (D) actions from other players over the past 5 rounds.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - The current stock is above 80% of capacity.
     - Less than 30% of recent opponent actions were D.
   - **Defect** if:
     - The stock drops below 60% of capacity.
     - More than 50% of recent opponent actions were D.

4. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - Always Defect to maximize individual payoff as the game is nearing conclusion, regardless of the stock level.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock_level, opponent_history):
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate
    if round_number < 0.2 * total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent defect rate
    recent_defect_rate = sum(1 for action in opponent_history[-5:] if action == 'D') / 5
    
    # Check stock threshold
    if stock_level > 0.8 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    elif stock_level < 0.6 * capacity or recent_defect_rate > 0.5:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Maintain current strategy based on past behavior
        return 'C' if recent_defect_rate < 0.3 else 'D'
    
    # Endgame: Defect
    if round_number >= 0.9 * total_rounds:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
This strategy begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource level. It adapts by monitoring both the stock's health and opponents' actions, switching to defection when necessary to prevent overexploitation or exploitation by others. In the final stages of the game, it prioritizes individual gain by defecting, ensuring maximum payoff as the game concludes.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_181 = '''
To effectively manage the balance between cooperation and defection based on observed player behavior and the state of the shared resource, I propose the following structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy begins with an initial cooperative move to encourage others to follow suit. Subsequent moves adapt based on the current stock level and recent player behavior, ensuring that cooperation is maintained when possible while defecting in response to exploitation or resource depletion.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Initial Move:**
   - In the first round, choose to Cooperate (C). This sets a positive precedent and incentivizes others to cooperate as well.

2. **Subsequent Moves (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **High Stock Condition:** If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, Cooperate. A healthy resource level suggests that cooperation can sustain without immediate risk.
   - **Low Stock Condition:** If the stock is below 25% of capacity, Defect. This prevents further depletion and maximizes individual gain before potential collapse.
   - **Moderate Stock Condition:** When the stock is between 25% and 75%:
     - Count the number of players who Defected in the previous round (D_prev).
     - If the ratio of Defectors (D_prev / n) exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%), choose to Defect. This counters exploitation by those defecting.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate to support resource sustainability.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Treat the final round similarly to others but with an adjusted threshold:
     - If the stock is above half of capacity, Cooperate to preserve what remains.
     - If below, decide based on previous rounds' Defectors, possibly defecting if exploitation was persistent.

### Adjustments for Different Group Sizes:
- **Small Groups (e.g., n=4):** Lower the defect threshold (e.g., 25%) as fewer defectors can significantly impact the resource.
- **Larger Groups:** Maintain or slightly increase the threshold to avoid overreacting to isolated defection instances.

### Rationale:
This strategy prioritizes maintaining a healthy resource by default, only defecting when necessary due to either low stock levels or significant exploitation. It balances individual gain with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation and resource collapse.

### Final Answer:

The proposed strategy is encapsulated as follows:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate.
2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   - If current stock ≥ 75% of capacity: Cooperate.
   - Else if current stock ≤ 25% of capacity: Defect.
   - Otherwise:
     - Count previous round's Defectors (D_prev).
     - If D_prev / n > 30%: Defect.
     - Else: Cooperate.
3. **Last Round (r):**
   - If current stock ≥ 50% of capacity: Cooperate.
   - Else: Choose based on prior Defectors, leaning towards Defect if exploitation was persistent.

**Answer:** The strategy is to initially cooperate and then adapt based on the resource level and others' actions. Cooperate when the stock is high or cooperation prevails; defect when the stock is low or many are defecting. This approach balances sustaining the resource with protecting against exploitation, implemented as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock is above 75% or fewer than 30% Defected last round; otherwise Defect.}}

To address the problem of promoting cooperation in a dynamic environment where players might defect for self-interest, we propose a strategic approach that balances punishment of defection with encouragement of cooperation. The strategy adapts to both past behavior and current resource levels, aiming to maintain sustainability.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.
2. **Monitor Past Behavior:** In subsequent rounds, assess the previous round's defection rate among all players.
3. **Set Defection Tolerance Levels:** Based on the current stock level:
   - If the stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), tolerate a higher defection rate (e.g., 30%) before deciding to defect.
   - If the stock is below this threshold, lower the tolerance (e.g., 10%) to encourage stricter cooperation and prevent further depletion.
4. **Adjust Tolerance for Final Rounds:** In the last few rounds, slightly increase the critical threshold to be cautious with remaining resources.
5. **Decision Making:** If the previous round's defection rate exceeds the set tolerance, defect in the current round to signal disapproval and encourage others to cooperate. Otherwise, continue cooperating.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, n, capacity, r):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate previous defection rate
    prev_defect_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'D')
    p_defect = prev_defect_count / n
    
    # Determine critical thresholds based on current stock and game progression
    critical_threshold = 0.5 * capacity  # Example, adjust as needed
    if round_number > r - 2:  # Last two rounds
        critical_threshold = 0.7 * capacity  # Be a bit more cautious
    
    # Decide tolerance based on current stock level (assuming current_stock is known)
    current_stock = get_current_stock()  # Function to retrieve current stock value
    if current_stock < critical_threshold:
        tolerance = 0.1  # Only tolerate 10% defection
    else:
        tolerance = 0.3  # Tolerate up to 30% defection
    
    # If previous defection rate exceeds tolerance, defect this round
    if p_defect > tolerance:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

**Answer:**

The proposed strategy effectively balances cooperation and defection by adapting to past behavior and current resource levels. By setting dynamic tolerance thresholds based on stock conditions, it promotes sustainable cooperation while deterring widespread defection.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; defect if previous defection rate exceeds a threshold adjusted for current stock level}}$

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperator-Defector (ACD)

The ACD strategy balances between cooperation for sustainable resource use and defection to maximize immediate payoffs when necessary. It adapts based on the current stock level, trends over time, and recent player behavior.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate to establish a baseline of sustainability.

2. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

3. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Smoothed Stock Check:** Calculate an exponential moving average of the stock history to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
     - If the smoothed stock is above 75% of capacity and increasing, Cooperate.
     - If between 25% and 75% of capacity:
       - Cooperate if more than half of players Cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, Defect.
     - If below 25%, always Defect.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(stock_history, last_round_actions):
    capacity = given_parameter
    current_round = len(stock_history) + 1

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # First round: Cooperate

    # Calculate smoothed stock using exponential moving average
    alpha = 0.5  # Smoothing factor
    if len(stock_history) > 1:
        smoothed_stock = alpha * stock_history[-1] + (1 - alpha) * stock_history[-2]
    else:
        smoothed_stock = stock_history[-1]

    threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity

    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'  # Last round: Defect

    if smoothed_stock > threshold_high and is_increasing(stock_history):
        return 'C'
    elif threshold_low <= smoothed_stock <= threshold_high:
        # Check cooperation rate in the last round
        cooperators = sum(1 for a in last_round_actions if a == 'C')
        if cooperators / len(last_round_actions) > 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Below threshold_low
        return 'D'

def is_increasing(stock_history):
    if len(stock_history) < 2:
        return True
    return stock_history[-1] >= stock_history[-2]
```

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize payoff without future repercussions.
- **Stock Near Thresholds:** Use smoothed averages to prevent volatility-driven oscillations between cooperation and defection.

### Robustness:

ACD is robust because it:
1. Encourages cooperation when the resource is healthy.
2. Adapts to cooperate or defect based on others' recent actions, preventing free-riding.
3. Maximizes immediate gains when resources are scarce, encouraging players to act before potential collapse.

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by promoting sustainability while remaining adaptive to varying conditions and player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_184 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource level while balancing individual gains, we propose a strategy where each player independently decides their action (Cooperate or Defect) based on the current stock level and its trend. The strategy uses predefined thresholds and trends to encourage collective cooperation unless forced by others' defection.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Each player initializes with an empty history of observed stock levels.
   - Define two thresholds:
     - Upper threshold (Cooperate Threshold): 75% of the capacity.
     - Lower threshold (Defect Threshold): 25% of the capacity.

2. **First Round Action:**
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate to start with a sustainable approach.

3. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - For each subsequent round:
     - Record the current stock level.
     - Calculate the trend by comparing the current stock with the previous rounds (e.g., using a moving average over the last three rounds).

4. **Decision Rules Based on Stock Level and Trend:**
   - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity:
     - Choose to Cooperate, promoting sustainability.
   - If the current stock is below 25% of capacity:
     - Choose to Defect, as the resource is nearing depletion, maximizing immediate payoff.
   - If the current stock is between 25% and 75% of capacity:
     - Check the trend of the stock over recent rounds.
     - If the stock is increasing (positive trend): Continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability.
     - If the stock is decreasing or stable: Choose to Defect, indicating that others are likely defecting, necessitating a shift towards maximizing individual payoff.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate to start sustainably.
   - Treat all rounds similarly without knowing which is the last round.
   - If the current stock exactly matches one of the thresholds, default to Cooperate to encourage sustainability.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, history):
    threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity
    
    if len(history) == 0:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Calculate trend based on last three rounds
    recent_stocks = history[-3:] + [current_stock]
    average_trend = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
    previous_average = sum(history[-4:-1]) / 3 if len(history) >=4 else current_stock
    
    trend = average_trend - previous_average
    
    if current_stock >= threshold_high:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif current_stock <= threshold_low:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        # Between thresholds, decide based on trend
        if trend > 0:
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Defect"
```

**Conclusion:**
This strategy ensures that each player independently contributes to maintaining a sustainable resource level by Cooperating when the stock is high and defecting only when necessary. By monitoring trends, players adapt dynamically to others' actions, promoting collective cooperation while being resilient against defection attempts.

The strategy is designed to maximize payoffs by balancing resource sustainability and exploitation, adapting dynamically based on the game's state:

### Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

1. **Initial Rounds (Cooperation Phase):**
   - Cooperate when the current stock \( S \) is above 50% of the maximum capacity (\( S > 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \)) and it's not one of the last few rounds.
   - This phase aims to sustain the resource, ensuring long-term benefits.

2. **Endgame Exploitation (Defection Phase):**
   - Defect in the last two rounds regardless of the stock level to maximize immediate gains as there are no future rounds to penalize overconsumption.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - If the stock falls below 50% capacity, switch to defecting to prevent further depletion and capture remaining resources before they diminish.
   - This adjustment helps in scenarios where other players might be defecting excessively, leading to rapid resource degradation.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, capacity):
    # Determine if it's one of the last two rounds
    is_last_two = (total_rounds - round_number) <= 1
    
    # Check if current stock is above the threshold and not in the endgame
    if not is_last_two and current_stock >= 0.5 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Cooperation Phase:** By cooperating when the stock is sufficiently high, the strategy supports sustainable resource management, allowing for regeneration each round.
- **Endgame Exploitation:** Switching to defecting in the final rounds ensures players maximize their payoffs without worrying about future depletions.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** If the stock unexpectedly drops below a critical threshold, the strategy adapts by defecting to mitigate further damage and capitalize on remaining resources.

This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors, as it reacts to observable state changes rather than relying on assumptions about others' strategies. It balances long-term sustainability with short-term gain optimization, making it effective across different game dynamics.

The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation with defection adaptively, ensuring sustainability while protecting against exploitation. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Strategy Overview
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by always cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage a cooperative environment and sustain the resource.

2. **Adaptive Thresholds**:
   - **Stock Threshold**: Cooperate if the current stock is above 75% of capacity. Defect if it drops below this threshold.
   - **Defector Proportion**: If more than 30% of other players defect in a round, switch to defection for subsequent rounds.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - Each round assesses the current stock and the proportion of defectors. Adjust actions based on these thresholds to either cooperate or defect.

4. **Final Round Handling**: Cooperate even in the last round to maintain long-term sustainability norms, encouraging others not to defect earlier.

### Rationale
- **Sustainability Focus**: Cooperating maintains a stable resource level, providing consistent payoffs.
- **Protection Against Exploitation**: Switching to defection when too many others defect prevents being exploited and encourages mutual cooperation.
- **Threshold-Based Adaptation**: The strategy dynamically responds to the state of the resource and other players' actions, promoting stability and resilience.

### Expected Outcomes
- Encourages collective cooperation, maintaining high stock levels and steady payoffs.
- Mitigates rapid depletion caused by defecting behavior, ensuring longer-term sustainability.

This strategy aims to maximize collective benefits while being robust against various player behaviors, fostering a balance between individual gain and group welfare.

description_COLLECTIVE_187 = '''
The optimal strategy for the AI is to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to maintain a high stock level and stable payoffs.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: For each subsequent round, assess the current stock level relative to a predetermined threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity). If the stock is above this threshold, continue to cooperate.

3. **Defection Threshold**: If the stock drops below the threshold, switch to defecting. This indicates that there's either excessive consumption due to defection or insufficient sustainable resource levels.

4. **Adapt Based on Past Actions**: Track the number of defectors in previous rounds. If more than half of the players defected in prior rounds, it signals a breakdown in cooperation. In such cases, defecting becomes advantageous as others are likely doing the same, maximizing immediate payoffs despite future consequences.

5. **Final Round Defection**: Always defect in the last round since there's no future impact to consider, allowing for maximum immediate gain without worrying about resource sustainability.

By following this strategy, the AI adapts dynamically to both current game states and historical player behavior, ensuring a balance between short-term gains and long-term resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_188 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Stock-Based Strategy**

The strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable resource management by adapting based on the current stock level and its trends.

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate when the stock is below 60% of capacity or decreasing rapidly to allow regrowth.
   - Defect when the stock is above 60% of capacity and stable to maximize payoff without risking depletion.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Start by defecting as the stock is full, allowing maximum immediate gain.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Adjust to cooperate if others are maintaining cooperation to sustain higher payoffs; otherwise, defect.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Monitor the average stock trend over recent rounds. If the stock is decreasing rapidly, lower the threshold to encourage earlier cooperation.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decision(current_stock, capacity, n_players, history):
    # Parameters
    threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    trend_window = 5  # Number of past rounds to consider for trend

    # Determine recent stock trend
    if len(history) > trend_window:
        recent_stocks = [h['stock'] for h in history[-trend_window:]]
        avg_stock_change = sum(recent_stocks)/len(recent_stocks)
    else:
        avg_stock_change = current_stock  # Use current stock as initial trend

    # Check if stock is decreasing rapidly
    rapid_decrease = (current_stock - avg_stock_change) < -0.1 * capacity

    # Decision logic
    if current_stock > threshold and not rapid_decrease:
        return 'D'  # Defect for higher payoff
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to help replenish

# Example usage in each round:
current_stock = game_state['stock']
action = decision(current_stock, capacity, n_players, game_history)
```

This strategy ensures adaptability by dynamically adjusting based on stock levels and trends, promoting cooperation when necessary to sustain resources while defecting for higher payoffs when the resource is abundant.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_189 = '''
To address the problem of resource management with cooperation and defection strategies, we propose setting a threshold based on the current stock relative to its maximum capacity. Specifically:

1. **Threshold Definition**: Players will cooperate if the current stock level is above 50% of the maximum capacity (C). If the stock falls below this threshold, players will defect.

2. **Rationale**:
   - **Cooperation Above Threshold**: Maintaining cooperation when the resource is healthy (above 50%) helps preserve it for future rounds, ensuring steady payoffs.
   - **Defection Below Threshold**: Switching to defection when the resource is depleted below 50% allows players to maximize their share of the remaining resource before it is exhausted.

3. **Implementation**:
   - In each round, assess whether the current stock (S) exceeds 50% of capacity.
     - If S > 0.5C: Cooperate by choosing an action that contributes to sustainable use.
     - If S ≤ 0.5C: Defect by taking as much resource as possible.

4. **Outcome**:
   - This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, preventing rapid depletion while allowing players to adapt when the resource is critically low.

By following this approach, players can optimize their payoffs over time without causing irreversible harm to the shared resource.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock exceeds 50% of capacity; otherwise, defect.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_190 = '''
**Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Response (ACDR)**

1. **Initial Round Action**: Cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative foundation and maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision Rules**:
   - Each player evaluates two factors from the previous round:
     1. The proportion of players who cooperated.
     2. The current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If both conditions are satisfied (more than half cooperated and stock is above a threshold, e.g., 50% of capacity), continue Cooperating.
   - Otherwise, Defect.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to initiate sustainable play.
   - **Last Rounds**: Apply the same decision rules; no special treatment ensures adaptability regardless of round progression.
   - **Low Stock Threshold (e.g., below 25% capacity)**: Switch to Defect to prevent further depletion and focus on immediate gains.

4. **Stock Dynamics Consideration**:
   - Monitor stock growth rates and adjust cooperation based on sustainability, encouraging mutual cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse.

This strategy balances cooperation with adaptability, fostering collective action while responding dynamically to changing conditions and opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_191 = '''
To address the problem of sustaining cooperation while maximizing individual payoff in a multi-player resource management game, the following strategy is proposed. This strategy balances between encouraging cooperation and protecting against resource depletion through defection when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.
2. **Conditional Cooperation**: In subsequent rounds (except the last), Cooperate only if both conditions are met:
   - A substantial majority of players Cooperated in the previous round.
   - The current stock level is sufficiently high to support sustainable growth.
3. **Defection in the Last Round**: Always Defect in the final round to maximize individual payoff, as there's no future punishment.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round (t = 1)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale**: Initiate with a cooperative move to encourage others to follow suit and maintain a healthy resource level.

2. **Middle Rounds (t = 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Determine Previous Cooperation**:
     - Calculate the number of players who Cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Check Current Stock**:
     - Assess if the current stock is above a specified threshold, indicating it's healthy enough for sustainable use.
   - **Decision Making**:
     - If both conditions are met (substantial cooperation and sufficient stock), continue to Cooperate.
     - Otherwise, switch to Defecting to either encourage others to Cooperate or protect against resource depletion.

3. **Last Round (t = r)**:
   - **Action**: Defect (D)
   - **Rationale**: Since there's no future round for retaliation, defecting maximizes individual payoff regardless of others' actions.

### Thresholds:
- **Cooperation Threshold**: Set at 70% of players. This ensures that Cooperating is only done when a significant majority is also Cooperating.
- **Stock Threshold**: Set at 80% of the resource capacity. This indicates a healthy stock level that can sustain use and replenish adequately.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, previous_actions, current_stock, n_players, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number < total_rounds:
        # Calculate number of Cooperators in the previous round
        cooperators = sum(1 for action in previous_actions[-1] if action == 'C')
        threshold_coop = 0.7 * n_players
        threshold_stock = 0.8 * capacity
        if cooperators > threshold_coop and current_stock > threshold_stock:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Last round
        return 'D'
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy encourages cooperation when conditions are favorable, thereby maintaining a healthy resource level and ensuring steady payoffs. It switches to defection when necessary to address potential resource depletion or to incentivize others to Cooperate, balancing individual gain with collective sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_192 = '''
To address the problem, we developed an adaptive strategy that considers both the current state of the resource and the behavior of other players. This strategy aims to encourage cooperation while preventing crashes by responding appropriately to changes in stock levels and cooperation rates.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with cooperation to maintain a healthy resource level.
2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: In subsequent rounds, decide whether to cooperate or defect based on:
   - The current stock level relative to capacity.
   - The proportion of other players who cooperated in the last round.
3. **Endgame Adjustment**: Near the end of the game, prioritize immediate gains by always defecting.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(stock_level, cooperation_rate, remaining_rounds, total_rounds):
    threshold_stock = 0.6 * capacity
    if stock_level >= threshold_stock and cooperation_rate > 0.7:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        # Check endgame condition
        if remaining_rounds <= 0.2 * total_rounds:
            return 'Defect'
        else:
            return 'Defect'

# Example usage within a game loop
capacity = 100  # Assuming capacity is known or can be inferred
total_rounds = 50
current_round = 1

while current_round <= total_rounds:
    stock_level = get_current_stock()  # Function to retrieve current stock level
    cooperation_rate = get_cooperation_rate()  # Function to retrieve other players' cooperation rate
    
    action = decide_action(stock_level, cooperation_rate, (total_rounds - current_round), total_rounds)
    
    # Perform the action and update game state accordingly
    if action == 'Cooperate':
        perform_cooperation()
    else:
        perform_defection()
    
    current_round += 1
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Phase**: The strategy starts with cooperation to maintain a healthy resource level, encouraging others to do the same.
- **Subsequent Rounds**: Players evaluate both the stock level and the cooperation rate of others. If the stock is above a certain threshold (60% capacity) and most others are cooperating, they continue to cooperate. Otherwise, they defect to either signal the need for more cooperation or take advantage of others' defection.
- **Endgame Adjustment**: As the game nears its end (less than 20% of total rounds remaining), players switch to always defecting to maximize their immediate payoffs.

This approach balances between maintaining the resource and responding to others' actions, ensuring adaptability while preventing crashes.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_193 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a balanced approach that combines monitoring current stock health with assessing recent cooperation rates among players. This strategy aims to promote sustainability while adapting to others' behaviors.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Players start by Cooperating in the first 20% of rounds to build trust and maintain resource levels.
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Based on current stock levels, players switch between Cooperating and Defecting using predefined thresholds:
   - **Upper Threshold (Safe Zone)**: If the stock is above this level, players Cooperate if others are also Cooperating; otherwise, they consider Defecting to signal dissatisfaction.
   - **Middle Range**: Players use a Tit-for-Tat approach, mirroring recent cooperation rates. If more than 60% of players Cooperated recently, they continue Cooperating; else, they Defect.
   - **Lower Threshold (Critical Zone)**: When the stock is low, players always Cooperate to prevent further depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, current_round):
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate
    if current_round < 0.2 * r:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate over the last 10 rounds
    recent_coop = sum(history[-last_10_rounds]) / (n * 10)
    
    # Define thresholds for stock health
    lower_threshold = 50  # Example value; adjust based on game parameters
    upper_threshold = 80  # Example value
    
    if current_stock > upper_threshold:
        # Safe to Cooperate if others are also doing so
        if recent_coop >= 0.7:  # 70% of players Cooperated recently
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Others not Cooperating, consider Defecting
            return 'D'
    elif lower_threshold <= current_stock <= upper_threshold:
        # Tit-for-Tat based on recent cooperation
        if recent_coop >= 0.6:  # More than 60% Cooperated
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Stock is low
        # Always Cooperate to prevent further depletion
        return 'C'
```

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Establishes a baseline of trust and sustainability.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adapts player actions based on stock health, encouraging sustainable behavior when resources are abundant and critical conservation when they are low.
- **Tit-for-Tat Approach**: Encourages mutual cooperation by mirroring others' actions, fostering a stable equilibrium.

### Conclusion

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, adapting to collective behaviors while preventing resource depletion. By monitoring stock levels and cooperation rates, players can dynamically adjust their actions to maintain the common pool resource effectively.

description_COLLECTIVE_194 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to encourage sustainable use of the resource.

2. **Sustainability Check:**
   - Monitor the stock level relative to capacity. If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, it's considered sustainable.

3. **Recent Behavior Analysis:**
   - Track cooperation rates in recent rounds (last 3 rounds). If more than 80% of other players have been Cooperating, continue Cooperating if sustainability is maintained.

4. **Adaptive Defection:**
   - If the stock falls below 75% capacity or if less than 80% of others Cooperated in recent rounds, switch to Defecting (D) to prevent resource depletion and exploit higher immediate payoffs.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last three rounds (to account for future punishment absence), prioritize self-interest by defecting unless the stock is significantly high (above 75% capacity), where cooperation might still yield benefits.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(state, history):
    n = state.n
    current_stock = state.stock
    capacity = state.capacity
    round_number = state.round
    total_rounds = state.total_rounds

    # First round default to Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Check if in the last few rounds (last 3)
    if round_number > total_rounds - 3:
        # Tendency to Defect unless stock is very high
        if current_stock < 0.75 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

    # Determine recent cooperation rate from history
    recent_cooperations = count_c(history, n, max(1, round_number - 3), round_number - 1)
    recent_rounds = min(3, round_number - 1)
    cooperation_rate = recent_cooperations / (n * recent_rounds)

    # Decision based on stock and recent behavior
    if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity and cooperation_rate > 0.8:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages sustainable use by starting with cooperation.
- **Sustainability Threshold (75%):** Maintains the resource above a critical level to prevent rapid depletion.
- **Behavioral Adaptation:** Adapts based on others' actions, continuing cooperation if the majority do so and sustainability is met; defects otherwise.
- **Endgame Adjustment:** Recognizes the absence of future punishment in final rounds, adjusting strategies accordingly to maximize individual payoff while considering resource preservation.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term self-interest, adapting dynamically to both resource conditions and peer behavior.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we'll outline a strategic approach that balances cooperation and defection based on the game's state and progression. The strategy is designed to be adaptive, ensuring sustainability of the common pool resource while protecting against exploitation.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating to maintain the resource level.
2. **Endgame Defection**: Near the end of the game, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains.
3. **Stock Thresholds**: Use thresholds (safe and danger levels) to decide between Cooperate and Defect actions based on the current stock level.
4. **Trend Analysis**: Monitor the trend of the stock over recent rounds to determine if cooperation is effective or if defection is necessary.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Always Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline for resource maintenance.

2. **Endgame Behavior**:
   - In the last 20% of rounds, switch to Defecting to exploit the remaining resource without regard for future sustainability.

3. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - **Safe Level**: If the stock is above 70% of capacity, Cooperate to sustain the resource.
   - **Danger Level**: If the stock falls below 30% of capacity, Defect as cooperation is no longer effective.

4. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Between safe and danger levels, assess if the stock trend is decreasing over recent rounds. If so, switch to Defecting.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, n, capacity, history, current_round, r):
    # Initialize thresholds
    safe_level = 0.7 * capacity
    danger_level = 0.3 * capacity
    round_threshold = 0.2 * r  # Switch to defect in last 20% rounds

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if approaching end of game
    rounds_remaining = r - current_round + 1
    if rounds_remaining <= round_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    # Decision based on current stock
    if current_stock >= safe_level:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock <= danger_level:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Check recent trend (last 3 rounds)
        trend_window = min(3, len(history))
        previous_stocks = [s for s in history[-trend_window:]]
        if is_trend_decreasing(previous_stocks):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def is_trend_decreasing(stock_levels):
    # Check if each subsequent stock level is lower than the previous
    for i in range(1, len(stock_levels)):
        if stock_levels[i] >= stock_levels[i-1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by Cooperating to maintain a high resource level, which promotes sustainability.
- **Endgame Defection**: As the game nears its end, players defect to maximize their immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds.
- **Stock Thresholds**: By setting thresholds (70% and 30%), the strategy adapts to the current state of the resource. Cooperation is maintained when the stock is healthy, while defection occurs if the resource becomes critically low.
- **Trend Analysis**: This step ensures that players adapt dynamically by observing recent trends. If the stock consistently decreases despite cooperation, it signals that others are defecting, prompting a switch to defection.

This strategy effectively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to various opponent behaviors while aligning with collective interests in maintaining the resource pool when possible.

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative Strategy (ACS)**

**Objective:**  
Maximize long-term payoff by fostering sustainable cooperation while being resilient to exploitation.

---

### **Decision Rules**

#### 1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - Rationale: Start with cooperation to promote resource sustainability and allow stock growth.
  - Pseudocode:
    ```python
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    ```

#### 2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
- **Cooperate if:**
  - The stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
  - At least 60% of players cooperated in the previous round.
  - Rationale: Maintain cooperation when resources are abundant and others are contributing sustainably.

- **Defect if:**
  - The stock is below the critical threshold.
  - Fewer than 40% of players cooperated in the previous round.
  - Rationale: Defend against exploitation by defecting when cooperation is low or resources are scarce.

#### 3. **Final Round (Round r):**
- **Action:** Defect (D)
  - Rationale: Exploit remaining resources without concern for future rounds, as there are none left.
  - Pseudocode:
    ```python
    if current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    ```

---

### **Adaptive Thresholds**
Adjust the critical stock threshold based on historical data to ensure robustness:
- If stock consistently remains above capacity * 0.85, lower the threshold to encourage more cooperation.
- If stock frequently drops below capacity * 0.75, raise the threshold to prevent over-exploitation.

---

### **Edge Cases**

#### 1. **Stock Near Capacity:**
- **Action:** Cooperate
  - Rationale: High stock levels indicate sustainability; continue contributing to growth.

#### 2. **Stock Close to Zero:**
- **Action:** Defect
  - Rationale: Minimal resources left; maximize personal gain in the last possible round before collapse.

---

### **Collective Mindset**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Start by cooperating to build a foundation for mutual benefits and sustainable resource use.

2. **Adaptive Play:**
   - Monitor stock levels and others' actions.
   - Cooperate when resources are plentiful and others contribute sustainably.
   - Defect if resources dwindle or too many players exploit the pool.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Retaliate against defectors by defecting in subsequent rounds to balance exploitation.

4. **Last Round Exploitation:**
   - Maximize gains in the final round without concern for future sustainability.

---

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track stock after each round and adjust thresholds accordingly.
2. **Analyze Previous Round Actions:** Note the number of Cooperators vs Defectors to inform current decisions.
3. **Adapt Thresholds:** Modify critical thresholds based on historical performance to optimize outcomes.

---

### **Pseudocode Summary**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        # Calculate critical thresholds based on historical data
        critical_threshold = adjust_critical_threshold(history)
        
        # Check cooperation rate in previous round
        prev_coop_rate = get_previous_cooperation_rate(history)
        
        if stock > critical_threshold and prev_coop_rate >= 0.6:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"

def adjust_critical_threshold(history):
    # Logic to adjust threshold based on historical stock levels
    pass

def get_previous_cooperation_rate(history):
    # Calculate cooperation rate in the previous round
    pass
```

---

### **Summary**

The Adaptive Cooperative Strategy (ACS) balances initial cooperation with adaptive behavior to sustain resources and maximize payoffs. By monitoring stock levels and player actions, it dynamically adjusts between cooperation and defection, ensuring resilience against various opponent behaviors while promoting collective sustainability.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation based on Stock Health**

1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1 to r - k)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate in the first round to maintain a healthy stock level.
   - **Monitoring**: After each round, evaluate the new stock level and growth rate.
   - **Threshold Check**: If the stock remains above a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), continue Cooperating. If below this threshold, switch to Defecting for the next few rounds.

2. **Late Rounds (Last k Rounds)**:
   - **Action**: Switch to Defecting regardless of the stock level, as there are limited future rounds left to maximize immediate payoffs.

3. **Dynamic Adaptation**:
   - After defecting for a set number of rounds (e.g., 2-3), reassess the stock.
     - If it has recovered above the threshold, return to Cooperating.
     - If not, continue Defecting cautiously until recovery or end of game.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - In the first round, always Cooperate to start sustainably.
   - If the stock drops extremely low (e.g., below 20%), stop defecting and focus on minimal consumption to allow some growth if possible.

5. **Consideration of Other Players' Actions**:
   - While primarily relying on stock levels, consider historical data on other players' actions. If a significant proportion (e.g., over 50%) are Defecting, it may signal the need for a strategic shift.

6. **Implementation Note**:
   - Use a weighted average of recent rounds' stock levels to make decisions smoother rather than relying solely on single-round thresholds.

This strategy aims to balance individual gains with collective sustainability by dynamically adapting based on the resource's health and other players' actions. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and switches to defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse, ensuring adaptability throughout the game.

**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to encourage sustainable play and set a positive precedent.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **Stock Level Assessment:**
      - **High Stock (Above 80% of Capacity):** Cooperate to maintain the resource's health, promoting long-term sustainability.
      - **Medium Stock (40%-80% of Capacity):** 
        - If the stock is increasing towards higher levels, continue Cooperating.
        - If decreasing below 60%, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains and prevent further depletion.
      - **Low Stock (Below 40% of Capacity):** Always Defect to secure as much payoff as possible before potential resource collapse.

3. **Behavior Adjustment:**
   - Focus on the trend of stock levels rather than individual player actions, using historical data to inform decisions without mid-round adjustments.

4. **Final Rounds (Last 20% of Total Rounds):**
   - Switch to always Defecting to maximize immediate gains, considering there's no future round impact beyond these rounds.

**Summary:**

This strategy balances individual self-interest with collective sustainability by adapting to the resource's state. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and shifts towards defection as the resource depletes or trends downward. The approach ensures adaptability without reliance on others' strategies, focusing instead on observable stock trends.

The strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to the state of the common pool and past player behaviors. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round:** Start with Cooperation (C) to promote sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - Track recent cooperation rates among players.
3. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate if the stock is above a threshold and recent cooperation is high.
   - Defect if the stock is low or there's significant recent defection.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Starting with cooperation helps maintain a sustainable resource level, encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1: Assess Stock Level**
     - Define thresholds (e.g., 80% of capacity as healthy, 50% as stressed).
   - **Step 2: Evaluate Recent Cooperation**
     - Track the proportion of Cooperations in the last few rounds.
   - **Decision:**
     - If stock is above threshold and cooperation rate is high (>60%), Cooperate (C).
     - If stock drops below threshold or cooperation rate falls significantly, consider Defecting (D) to prevent over-depletion.

3. **Endgame (Last Few Rounds):**
   - Players may be tempted to defect for higher immediate payoffs.
   - Strategy: Adjust based on remaining rounds and current stock:
     - If close to zero stock, Cooperate minimally.
     - Otherwise, balance between Cooperating and Defecting based on future impact.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, stock, capacity, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.5 * capacity
    
    recent_coop_rate = calculate_recent_cooperation(history)
    
    if stock > threshold_high and recent_coop_rate > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    elif stock < threshold_low or recent_coop_rate < 0.4:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Adjust based on remaining rounds
        if round_number >= total_rounds - 2:
            if stock == capacity:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D' if random.random() > 0.5 else 'C'
        else:
            return 'C'

def calculate_recent_cooperation(history):
    recent_rounds = history[-min(10, len(history)):]
    coop_count = sum(1 for action in recent_rounds if action == 'C')
    return coop_count / len(recent_rounds) if recent_rounds else 0
```

### Summary:
This strategy promotes sustainability by initially Cooperating and adapting based on the stock's health and recent player behaviors. It dynamically adjusts to prevent over-depletion while considering endgame scenarios to balance immediate and future payoffs.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Retaliation**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff while maintaining sustainable resource levels through dynamic cooperation and controlled defection.

---

### **Decision Rules:**
1. **Cooperate** if:
   - Current stock is above 80% of capacity.
   - Recent cooperation rate (last 5 rounds) exceeds 70%.

2. **Defect** if:
   - Current stock falls below 60% of capacity.
   - Recent cooperation rate drops below 30%, especially in the last few rounds.

3. **Adjust Thresholds Dynamically:**
   - Increase cooperation threshold by 10% after consecutive cooperative rounds with positive stock growth.
   - Decrease defect trigger by 10% if defection leads to significant resource depletion.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others and set a positive precedent.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds):** Adjust strategy based on current stock and cooperation rates. If cooperation is high, continue; otherwise, defect cautiously.

---

### **Collective Strategy Alignment:**
Encourage sustainability by rewarding cooperation with continued cooperation. Retaliatory defection against frequent defectors aims to reset the balance towards collective resource preservation without spiraling into mutual depletion.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, recent_actions, rounds_remaining):
    capacity = 100  # Example value; adjust based on game parameters
    cooperation_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    defect_trigger = 0.6 * capacity
    memory_length = 5

    # Calculate recent cooperation rate
    total_players = len(recent_actions[0]) if recent_actions else n
    cooperation_count = sum([sum(actions == 'C') for actions in recent_actions])
    cooperation_rate = cooperation_count / (total_players * min(len(recent_actions), memory_length))

    # Decision logic
    if current_stock > cooperation_threshold and cooperation_rate > 0.7:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < defect_trigger or (rounds_remaining < 5 and cooperation_rate < 0.3):
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# Dynamic threshold adjustment (to be applied after each round)
def adjust_thresholds(current_stock, action, payoff):
    global cooperation_threshold, defect_trigger
    if action == 'C' and current_stock > cooperation_threshold:
        cooperation_threshold *= 1.10
    elif action == 'D' and current_stock < defect_trigger:
        defect_trigger *= 0.90

# Example usage in a round
current_stock = get_current_stock()
recent_actions = get_recent_actions(memory_length)
rounds_remaining = total_rounds - current_round
action = decide_action(current_stock, recent_actions, rounds_remaining)
adjust_thresholds(current_stock, action, payoff_received)
```

---

### **Conclusion:**
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adapting to resource levels and player behavior. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and employs controlled defection to manage exploitation, aiming for a stable equilibrium that benefits all players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_201 = '''
**Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, choose to Cooperate (C). This encourages others to also cooperate and helps sustain the common pool resource.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
   - Define a threshold level of the stock, set at 50% of the capacity. This is where growth peaks, making it optimal for sustaining the resource.
   - In each subsequent round:
     - If the current stock is above the threshold (≥ 50% of capacity), continue Cooperating (C) to support sustainable consumption.
     - If the current stock is below the threshold (< 50% of capacity), switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff before potential resource collapse.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - As the game progresses, adjust the threshold based on the number of rounds remaining. In later rounds, lower the threshold slightly to become more inclined towards defecting, as future payoffs matter less.

4. **Expectation and Adaptation:**
   - After each round where you cooperate, calculate the expected stock level if everyone had cooperated.
   - Compare this with the actual stock:
     - If actual stock is significantly lower than expected, infer that others are defecting. Start defecting in future rounds to maximize your payoff.
     - If actual stock meets or exceeds expectations, continue cooperating.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., 10% of total rounds remaining), prioritize maximizing immediate payoffs by defecting more aggressively, as there are no future rounds to benefit from sustainable consumption.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decision_rule(round_number, stock_level, capacity, n, r):
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity  # Initial threshold at 50% of capacity
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Adjust threshold dynamically as rounds progress
    if round_number > r / 2:
        threshold *= (r - round_number) / r  # Lower threshold in later rounds
    
    # Calculate expected stock if everyone cooperated last round
    expected_stock = (stock_level + previous_growth)
    
    # Compare actual and expected stock
    if stock_level < expected_stock * 0.8:  # If actual is significantly lower
        return 'D'
    else:
        if stock_level >= threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages others to maintain the resource, promoting a sustainable outcome.
- **Threshold-Based Switching:** Balances between sustaining the resource and defecting when overexploitation is detected, adapting to others' strategies.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Accounts for the diminishing importance of future payoffs as the game progresses.
- **Expectation Comparison:** Detects cooperation levels among players, allowing adaptation to changing behaviors.
- **Endgame Aggression:** Maximizes immediate gains in the final rounds when future rounds no longer provide benefits.

This strategy aims to maximize total payoff by balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to the game's progression and others' actions.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff over multiple rounds while maintaining a sustainable resource level.

**Strategy Overview:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Start with Cooperating in the first round to observe others' behavior and maintain stock stability.
- **Adaptive Behavior:** Adjust actions based on observed cooperation rates, remaining rounds, and current stock levels.
- **Endgame Adjustment:** Near the end of the game, switch to Defecting as future penalties are minimized.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate to establish a baseline and observe others' actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-3):**
   - **Cooperation Rate:** Track the proportion of players who Cooperated in previous rounds.
     - If cooperation rate > threshold (e.g., 70%), consider Defecting occasionally for higher payoffs.
     - If cooperation rate ≤ threshold, Cooperate more frequently to stabilize the stock.
   - **Stock Level Check:**
     - If current stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), consider Defecting as growth can compensate for consumption.
     - If below this threshold, Cooperate to prevent further depletion and aid regrowth.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Rounds r-2 to r):**
   - Switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future impacts.

**Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Unilaterally Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Focus on maximizing individual payoff by defecting, as there are no long-term consequences.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use thresholds (e.g., 70% cooperation rate, 50% stock level) to decide actions adaptively.
- Balance between exploiting Cooperation and contributing to sustainability based on observed behavior and resource levels.

This strategy aims to be robust against various opponent behaviors by dynamically adjusting actions, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term resource health.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Threshold Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

To address the challenges of the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive threshold strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on observed trends in stock levels. This strategy aims to maintain sustainability while preventing over-depletion.

### **Strategy Overview**

The strategy uses dynamic thresholds to decide between Cooperating (C) and Defecting (D). It adapts based on the current stock level relative to capacity and recent changes, ensuring sustainable resource use.

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Sets a cooperative tone, promoting sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Calculate Current Stock Relative to Capacity (SR):** SR = (Current Stock / Capacity) * 100
   - **Determine Recent Trend:**
     - Compare SR with the previous round's stock relative to capacity.
   - **Adjust Action Based on Thresholds:**
     - **Coop Threshold (CT):** If SR > CT and stable/increasing, Cooperate.
     - **Defect Threshold (DT):** If SR < DT or significant drop, Defect.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - **Base Values:** CT = 80%, DT = 70% (adjustable based on game parameters)
   - **Adjust for Player Count (n):** Lower thresholds if n increases to account for higher potential depletion.

4. **Last Round Handling:**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximizes individual payoff with no future rounds, preventing others from exploiting the resource.

### **Pseudocode**

```python
def decide_action(round_history):
    n = game_params['n']
    capacity = game_params['capacity']
    
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if not round_history:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate current and previous stock levels relative to capacity
    current_stock = round_history[-1]['stock_after_growth']
    prev_stock = round_history[-2]['stock_after_growth'] if len(round_history) > 1 else capacity
    
    SR_current = (current_stock / capacity) * 100
    SR_prev = (prev_stock / capacity) * 100
    
    # Determine thresholds, adjusted for n
    CT = max(75, 80 - (n/2))  # Example adjustment
    DT = max(60, 70 - (n/2))
    
    # Check stock trend and decide action
    if SR_current > CT and SR_prev <= SR_current:
        return 'C'
    elif SR_current < DT or SR_prev - SR_current > 5:  # Significant drop
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'  # Default to Cooperate when uncertain

# Example usage:
round_history = [{'stock_after_growth': 90}, {'stock_after_growth': 85}]
action = decide_action(round_history)
print(action)  # Output: 'C' or 'D'
```

### **Rationale**

- **Cooperation Promotion:** Encourages sustainability when the stock is healthy.
- **Defection Prevention:** Protects against over-depletion by adapting to significant drops in stock levels.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Thresholds adjust based on player count, ensuring relevance across different game setups.

This strategy balances individual payoff with collective resource management, fostering a sustainable approach while being responsive to changing conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_204 = '''
To develop an effective strategy in the context of resource management within a discrete game framework, the following organized approach is proposed:

### Strategy Overview

The strategy balances between preserving the resource for long-term gains and maximizing immediate payoff when necessary. It adapts based on observed outcomes (stock levels) rather than relying on assumptions about other players' strategies.

### Key Components

1. **Initial Cooperation**
   - Begin by Cooperating in the initial rounds to establish a baseline of sustainable resource use.

2. **Threshold-Based Monitoring**
   - Establish thresholds to determine when to switch between Cooperating and Defecting.
     - **Lower Threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity):** If the stock drops below this level, it indicates overuse by others; switch to Defecting.
     - **Upper Threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity):** If the stock recovers above this level, indicating sustainable use, switch back to Cooperating.

3. **State Switching with Hysteresis**
   - Use hysteresis to prevent oscillation:
     - Switch to Defecting when the stock is below the lower threshold.
     - Return to Cooperating only when the stock exceeds the upper threshold.

4. **Late-Round Exploitation**
   - In the final 20% of rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff as future benefits diminish.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Rounds (First k Rounds)**
   - Choose to Cooperate to support sustainable resource use and observe the baseline stock behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Middle Phase)**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to the thresholds.
     - If below 80%: Switch state to Defecting.
     - If above 90%: Return to Cooperating.
   - Maintain the current state if within the threshold range.

3. **Final Rounds (Last m Rounds)**
   - Always choose to Defect to capitalize on remaining resources without regard for long-term sustainability.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider a game with 50 rounds, capacity = 100 units, and n=4 players.

- **Rounds 1-10:** Cooperate. Observe stock behavior.
- **Rounds 11-40:**
  - If stock <80%: Defect.
  - If stock >90%: Cooperate.
  - Else: Continue current state.
- **Rounds 41-50:** Always Defect.

### Conclusion

This strategy is designed to adapt dynamically, ensuring resource sustainability while maximizing personal payoff when necessary. By focusing on observable outcomes rather than others' strategies, it provides a robust approach to balancing immediate and long-term gains in competitive environments.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_205 = '''
The optimal strategy for balancing immediate gains and long-term sustainability in this scenario involves starting with cooperation to maintain the resource and adaptively switching to defection based on observed trends. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in early rounds to sustain the resource and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Monitor Stock Trends**: Track changes in the stock level over time. If the stock consistently decreases despite cooperation, it may indicate that other players are defecting more frequently.
3. **Adaptive Defection**:
   - If the current stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoffs before the resource is depleted.
   - If there's a significant trend of decreasing stock, indicating others are defecting, gradually shift towards defecting more often.
4. **Sustainability Check**: After defecting, if the stock begins to recover or stabilize (possibly due to others adjusting their strategies), revert back to cooperation.
5. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always cooperate to start sustainably.
   - **Last Few Rounds**: Defect to maximize payoff since there's no future impact.

### Decision Rule Implementation:
- **Cooperate** if:
  - It's the first round.
  - The current stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) and has been stable or increasing in recent rounds.
  - Observing that cooperation leads to sustainable growth.
  
- **Defect** if:
  - The current stock is below a critical level (e.g., 50% of capacity).
  - There's a significant trend of decreasing stock over time, indicating others are defecting more.
  - In the last few rounds, defect to maximize payoff.

### Considerations:
- **Thresholds and Trends**: Choose thresholds and trends that allow cooperation as long as possible without letting the resource dwindle too much.
- **Gradual Shift**: If switching from cooperate to defect, consider a gradual shift to prevent sudden stock drops. However, without coordination, this may be challenging, so simpler rules based on observable state changes are practical.

### Conclusion:
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by starting with cooperation and adaptively switching behaviors based on observed resource trends. It handles edge cases appropriately and is robust against different opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_206 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining sustainable resource exploitation among players, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level relative to a predefined threshold.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define the Threshold (T):**
   - Set T at 50% of the total capacity (C). This threshold represents the minimum stock level required to sustain cooperation and ensure resource recovery through growth.

2. **Determine Player Action:**
   - At each round, check the current stock level (S).
   - If S ≥ T, players Cooperate by consuming a moderate amount, allowing for sustainable use.
   - If S < T, players Defect by maximizing their consumption to exploit the remaining resource before potential collapse.

3. **Implementation of Strategy:**
   - Players observe the current stock and past actions to decide their move.
   - By following this rule, players ensure that when resources are abundant (above 50%), cooperation prevents overexploitation, promoting long-term sustainability. When resources dip below this level, defection is justified as a response to an impending scarcity.

**Answer:**

Players should Cooperate if the current stock is at least half of the total capacity; otherwise, they should Defect. 

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock} \geq 50\% \text{of capacity, else Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_207 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round (t=1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Start by promoting sustainability and encouraging others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t>1):**
   - Calculate the cooperation rate as `(number of players who chose C in the previous round) / n`.
   - Check if the current stock is above 75% of capacity (`0.75 * capacity`).

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - If **stock > 0.75 * capacity**:
     - If **cooperation_rate >= 60% (0.6)**, Cooperate (C).
     - Else, Defect (D).
       - Rationale: Maintain sustainability when enough players are cooperating. Switch to defecting if cooperation drops significantly.
   - If **stock <= 0.75 * capacity**:
     - Defect (D)
       - Rationale: Prevent further depletion and potential collapse of the resource.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round (t=r):**
     - Since there are no future rounds, players might defect to maximize immediate payoff. However, following the strategy, if the stock is above 75% and cooperation rate is high, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.
   - **Stock Depletion (stock=0):**
     - Once stock hits zero, it cannot recover, so all subsequent rounds will likely result in Defection.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, n, cooperation_rate):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
            if cooperation_rate >= 0.6:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

**Rationale:**

- This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by Cooperating when the resource is healthy and enough others are doing so, thereby encouraging a cooperative equilibrium.
- It adapts to changes in player behavior, switching to Defecting if too many players exploit the resource, preventing further depletion and potential collapse.
- The 75% stock threshold ensures that the resource remains sustainable while allowing room for natural growth. The cooperation rate threshold (60%) acts as a safeguard against exploitation by ensuring that Cooperating is only done when a significant majority does so.

This approach is robust to various opponent behaviors, promoting collective sustainability and adapting to shifts in player strategies over time.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_208 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that encourages cooperation while deterring defection. Here's the organized solution:

### Strategy Overview

The strategy is designed to promote sustainable use of the common pool resource through initial cooperation, adaptability based on others' actions, and careful consideration of the stock level.

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Begin with trust-building by cooperating, allowing the stock to grow and encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Middle Rounds (from Round 2 to Round r-1):**
   - **Monitor Previous Round's Cooperation:**
     - Count the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Check Stock Health:**
     - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity, it is considered healthy.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - **Cooperate** if both conditions are met:
       - The number of cooperators in the previous round is at least half of the players (n/2).
       - The current stock level is above 80% of capacity.
     - **Defect** otherwise to punish defection and encourage future cooperation.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Ensure sustainable use in the final round, maximizing collective payoff despite no future rounds.

### Pseudocode

```pseudocode
function decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number < r-1:
        prev_cooperators = count(history[round_number - 2])
        if prev_cooperators >= n/2 and stock_level >= 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # last round
        return 'C'
```

### Handling Edge Cases

- **First Round:** Unconditional cooperation to set a positive precedent.
- **Middle Rounds:** Adaptive behavior based on previous cooperation and stock health, ensuring sustainability and deterring defection.
- **Last Round:** Cooperation to maximize collective payoff, despite the temptation to defect.

### Alignment with Collective Mindset

This strategy prioritizes long-term sustainability over short-term gains. By rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, it encourages a collectively beneficial outcome, ensuring the resource remains available for all players throughout the game.

By following these rules, the strategy aims to maintain a healthy stock level, promote cooperation among players, and adapt dynamically to different behaviors and stock conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_209 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate in the first round when the stock is at maximum capacity. This helps sustain the resource and promotes cooperation among players.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **Cooperate Conditionally:** If the current stock exceeds 50% of the capacity and most players cooperated in the previous round, continue to Cooperate. This maintains sustainable consumption levels.
   b. **Defect Strategically:** If the stock drops below 50% or if a significant number of players Defected in prior rounds, switch to Defecting. This maximizes immediate gains while preventing further resource depletion.

3. **Adaptation and Monitoring:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock's health and other players' actions. Adjust cooperation levels based on these observations to balance individual gain with collective sustainability.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds, consider defecting more frequently to exploit remaining resources, as there is less future impact from such actions.

5. **Cool-Down Period:**
   - After a period of Defection, switch back to Cooperating if the stock recovers above the 50% threshold. This prevents endless cycles of defection and promotes resource sustainability.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on the common pool's health and opponents' behaviors, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_210 = '''
To address the problem of balancing individual gain against collective resource sustainability in a repeated social dilemma scenario, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both current resource levels and recent cooperation rates. The strategy aims to maintain cooperation when beneficial while defending against exploitation.

### Approach
The strategy is designed to:
1. **Cooperate Initially**: Start by Cooperating in the first round when the resource is abundant.
2. **Defect in the Last Round**: Since there are no future rounds, defecting maximizes immediate gain without worrying about long-term consequences.
3. **Adaptive Cooperation**:
   - Monitor recent cooperation rates from previous rounds to gauge collective behavior.
   - Adjust the required cooperation threshold based on the current stock level relative to capacity:
     - **High Stock (Above 80%)**: Lower threshold for Cooperating, allowing more leniency towards occasional defection.
     - **Moderate Stock (50-80%)**: Medium threshold, encouraging higher cooperation to prevent further depletion.
     - **Low Stock (Below 50%)**: Higher threshold, enforcing stricter cooperation to allow resource recovery.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    if round_number == r:  # Assuming 'r' is the total number of rounds
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate from last k rounds (e.g., 3)
    k = min(3, len(history))
    recent_coop_rate = sum(1 for action in history[-k:] if action == 'C') / k
    
    # Determine thresholds based on stock level
    if stock_level > capacity * 0.8:
        coop_threshold = 0.6
    elif stock_level > capacity * 0.5:
        coop_threshold = 0.7
    else:
        coop_threshold = 0.8
    
    if recent_coop_rate >= coop_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins by Cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and sustainability.
- **Final Round Defection**: Recognizing no future rounds, defecting optimizes immediate gain without risking long-term resource damage.
- **Adaptive Thresholds**:
  - When the stock is high (above 80% capacity), the strategy requires less cooperation from others to Cooperate, allowing some flexibility.
  - As the stock decreases, stricter requirements for cooperation are imposed to encourage collective efforts in preserving the resource.
  - This adaptability ensures that the strategy responds dynamically to both the state of the resource and the behavior patterns of other players.

By integrating these elements, the proposed approach effectively balances individual gain with the sustainability of shared resources, fostering cooperation when beneficial while protecting against exploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_211 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by considering both the current stock level and the cooperation rate of other players.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Round Strategy:** Begin with Cooperating to establish a baseline of cooperation and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Evaluate Stock Health:** In each subsequent round, assess whether the current stock (S_t) is above 60% of capacity. This threshold ensures that there's enough resource left for sustainable growth in future rounds.

3. **Assess Cooperation History:** Check the cooperation rate from the previous round. If at least 70% of players Cooperated, it indicates a cooperative environment conducive to continued Cooperation.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - If both conditions are met (S_t > 60% capacity and ≥70% Cooperated last round), continue to Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, switch to Defecting to either punish defectors or maximize immediate payoff when the resource is low.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment:** Maintain adaptability by periodically reviewing thresholds based on observed trends in stock levels and cooperation rates.

**Final Answer:**

The proposed strategy is for each player to Cooperate if both the current stock exceeds 60% of capacity and at least 70% of players Cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, Defect. This approach balances immediate gains with sustainability and encourages a cooperative environment.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if S > 60\% capacity and ≥70\% cooperated last round; else Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_212 = '''
To address the challenge of sustainably managing a shared resource while competing with other agents, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on observed changes in the resource's health. Here is the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating (C) in the first round to establish trust and observe others' behavior without impacting the resource negatively.

2. **Monitor Resource Health**: After each subsequent round, calculate whether the total consumption led to an increase, decrease, or stability in the resource stock. This is done by computing:
   - `total_consumption_prev`: Sum of all players' consumption from the previous round.
   - `S_remaining_prev = S_prev - total_consumption_prev`
   - `growth_prev = 2 * S_remaining_prev * (1 - S_remaining_prev / capacity)`
   - `new_stock_prev = min(S_remaining_prev + growth_prev, capacity)`

3. **Adaptive Defection Threshold**:
   - If the resource stock decreased (`new_stock_prev < S_prev`) but remains above a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to defecting (D) in the next round to signal against overuse.
   - If the resource is critically low (`new_stock_prev <= 0.25 * capacity`), continue cooperating (C) to attempt rebuilding the resource.

4. **Maintain Sustainability**: Cooperate (C) if the resource stock remains stable or increases, ensuring continued sustainability and encouraging others to do the same.

**Final Strategy:**

- Start with cooperation.
- Defect only when the previous round's overuse caused a significant decrease in the resource but hasn't critically depleted it.
- Cooperate when the resource is stable, increasing, or critically low to foster recovery.

This approach ensures that we adaptively manage our actions based on the resource's state, promoting sustainable use while responding appropriately to others' behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_213 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Moves):**
   - Begin with cooperation in the initial 2-3 rounds to establish a sustainable resource level and encourage others to cooperate.

2. **Monitoring Opponents:**
   - Track the proportion of defection in recent rounds (last 5 rounds) using a weighted average where more recent data has higher weight.

3. **Decision Rules Based on Defection Rate:**
   - If the defection rate is below a threshold (e.g., 30%), continue to cooperate.
   - If the defection rate exceeds this threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains and signal others about overexploitation.

4. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - Cooperate if stock > 80% of capacity, as it indicates a healthy resource level.
   - Defect if stock < 60%, to exploit remaining resources before potential depletion.
   - Between 60%-80%, adapt based on recent defection rates.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to build trust and maintain stock levels.
   - **Last Known Round:** Defect to maximize payoff, anticipating others might also defect.
   - **Unknown Last Round:** Continue with the adaptive strategy focusing on sustainability.

6. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   - Promote long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation when sustainable and defecting only when necessary to prevent resource collapse.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history_defection_rate):
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'
    else:
        recent_defection = calculate_recent_defection(history)
        if recent_defection < DEFECT_THRESHOLD and stock_level > STOCK_HIGH:
            return 'C'
        elif stock_level < STOCK_LOW:
            return 'D'
        else:
            if history_defection_rate > ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD:

def calculate_recent_defection(history, weight=0.7):
    # Apply weights to recent rounds for a more responsive strategy
    weighted_history = [ (1 - weight)**i * h for i, h in enumerate(reversed(history))]

# Thresholds and constants
DEFECT_THRESHOLD = 0.3  # 30% defection rate triggers switch to D
STOCK_HIGH = 0.8        # Cooperate if stock is above 80% of capacity
STOCK_LOW = 0.6         # Defect if stock is below 60%

    history.append(action == 'D')

**Summary:**
This strategy balances cooperation for sustainability with adaptive defection based on observed behavior and resource levels. It aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining collective resource health.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_214 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to promote sustainable cooperation while being adaptive to various player behaviors and resource states. Here's a structured overview:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with Cooperate in the first two rounds to build a baseline of sustainability and prevent immediate depletion.

2. **Stock Monitoring**:
   - Track the stock level relative to capacity.
   - Classify the stock as "healthy" (above 50% capacity), "stressed" (below 30%), or neutral otherwise.
   - Assess recent trends in stock growth/shrinkage to gauge sustainability of current consumption levels.

3. **Opponent Behavior Tracking**:
   - Maintain a history of each opponent's actions, calculating their cooperation rate (Cs / total rounds observed).
   - Use these rates to assess overall cooperation trends among opponents.

4. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate**: If the stock is healthy and most opponents have high cooperation rates (>70%), continue Cooperating.
   - **Defect**: If the stock is stressed or a significant number of opponents are Defecting, switch to Defect as punishment until cooperation improves.

5. **Adaptive Punishment**:
   - Upon detecting Defectors, defect against them for several rounds to incentivize future cooperation.

6. **Handling Final Rounds**:
   - In the last 10% of total rounds, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff by increasing defection, as there's no future impact.

### Rationale

- **Encouraging Cooperation**: By starting with Cooperate and rewarding sustainable behavior, the strategy fosters a cooperative environment.
- **Deterrence Through Punishment**: Detecting Defectors and responding with Defect creates an incentive for them to revert to Cooperate, maintaining resource health.
- **Adaptability**: The strategy dynamically adjusts based on stock health and opponent behavior, ensuring robustness against varying conditions.

### Implementation

Players independently apply this strategy, using their observations of the game state and others' actions. It ensures collective behavior emerges from individual decisions, aiming to sustain the common pool resource effectively across all rounds.

```pseudocode
for each round t in 1..r:
    if t == 1 or t == 2:
        action = C
    else:
        # Calculate stock health
        stock_health = current_stock / capacity
        is_stressed = stock_health < 0.3
        is_healthy = stock_health > 0.5

        # Track opponent cooperation rates
        coop_rates = calculate_cooperation_rates(opponent_histories)

        # Determine if most opponents are Cooperating
        avg_coop = average(coop_rates.values())
        high_coop = avg_coop > 0.7

        # Check for Defectors to punish
        recent_defectors = [i for i in players if opponent_histories[i][-punishment_window:].count(D) > punishment_threshold]

        # Decision
        if is_healthy and high_coop:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
        
    record_action(action)
```

description_COLLECTIVE_215 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The collective strategy is designed to maximize payoffs over multiple rounds while ensuring the sustainability of the common pool resource. It adapts based on current conditions and opponents' behavior, balancing immediate gains with long-term benefits.

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - *Reasoning:* Preserves the stock at maximum capacity, allowing sustainable growth for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Level (S):**
     - If S is above a dynamically adjusted threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), cooperate to sustain and grow the resource.
     - If S is below this threshold, consider defecting to maximize immediate payoff as the stock may not recover significantly.

3. **Adaptation Based on Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Track the historical cooperation rate of other players.
     - If most are cooperating, continue cooperation to maintain higher stock levels.
     - If many are defecting, switch to defection to avoid being exploited and reduce long-term losses from resource depletion.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Adjust the threshold based on observed consumption patterns and growth rates. For instance, if the stock has been decreasing despite cooperation, lower the threshold for switching to defection.

5. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - *Reasoning:* No future rounds to penalize defection; maximize immediate payoff without regard to future consequences.

6. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If S approaches zero, defect as there's little left for sustainable growth.
   - If S is near capacity, cooperate to ensure the resource remains at a high, sustainable level.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, cooperation_history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = maximum_sustainable_stock
    threshold = capacity * 0.5  # Initial threshold

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Adjust threshold based on historical data and cooperation rate
        avg_coop_rate = sum(cooperation_history) / len(cooperation_history)
        if stock_level > threshold and avg_coop_rate > 0.6:  # Arbitrary threshold for cooperation rate
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    if round_number == r:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy starts with cooperation to sustain the resource, then adapts based on stock levels and opponents' actions.
- It uses a dynamic threshold and historical cooperation rates to decide between C and D, ensuring sustainability when possible while adapting to exploiters.
- In the last round, it defects to maximize payoff without future repercussions.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, providing a robust solution against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_216 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoffs over multiple rounds by balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative trend to encourage sustainable stock levels and promote growth for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Level (S):** 
     - If S is above a dynamic threshold, cooperate to maintain or enhance the resource.
     - If S falls below this threshold, defect to maximize immediate payoff, especially if others are defecting.
   - **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold decreases over time, encouraging more defection as rounds progress and future consequences diminish.

3. **Late Rounds (Last Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Prioritize immediate gains since future rounds are limited or nonexistent, minimizing the impact of stock depletion.

4. **Adaptation Based on Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Track the number of defections in previous rounds.
   - If a majority defects, increase tendency to defect to prevent payoff loss from cooperation while others exploit the resource.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```
for each round in r:
    if round is among first few:
        play C
    else:
        calculate current stock S
        determine number of players who defected last round (defectors)
        threshold = initial_threshold - (round_progress * adjustment_factor)
        if S > threshold and defectors < majority:
            play C
        else:
            play D
```

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Cooperate to foster a positive environment and encourage growth.
- **Last Rounds:** Defect to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future depletions.

**Conclusion:** This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to stock levels, opponents' actions, and the progression of rounds. It promotes cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection as necessary to optimize payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_217 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start positively to preserve the resource and encourage others to cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Historical Behavior:**
     - Track the number of defects in each round.
     - Determine if more than a threshold percentage (e.g., 30%) of players are defecting.

   - **Assess Stock Level:**
     - If the current stock is above a healthy threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), continue cooperating.
     - If the stock drops below this threshold, consider defecting to prevent immediate loss of resource.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate:** If less than or equal to the defect threshold and stock is above 75%.
   - **Defect:** If more than the defect threshold or stock is below 75%.

4. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Maintain sustainability even in the last round to avoid unnecessary depletion.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    defect_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'D')
    defect_ratio = defect_count / n

    stock_threshold = 0.75 * capacity

    if current_stock >= stock_threshold and defect_ratio <= 0.3:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage
current_round = 2
past_history = [ ['C', 'C', 'D', 'D'], ... ] # Previous rounds' actions
current_stock_value = 90

action = decide_action(current_round, past_history, current_stock_value)
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to others' behaviors and the current state of the resource. It ensures cooperation when beneficial and defects only when necessary to prevent resource depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_218 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment**

The proposed strategy aims to maintain cooperation while addressing potential defection through punishment, ensuring adaptability and robustness across varying opponent behaviors.

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - All players Cooperate (C) to build trust and sustain the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-5% of total rounds):**
   - Each player monitors the actions of all others in the previous `m` rounds (e.g., m=3).
   - If any player Defected (D) within this window, the player defects in the current round.
   - Otherwise, continue Cooperating.

3. **Final 5% Rounds (Last Few Rounds):**
   - Players switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds do not exist. This prevents others from exploiting the remaining resource without consequence.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(history, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players()
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number <= (total_rounds - 0.05 * total_rounds):
        recent_defectors = any(player_defected in history[-m:] for player_defected in history[-m:])
        return 'D' if recent_defectors else 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Threshold for Defection:** The strategy assumes that observing any defection triggers a response. This helps maintain cooperation unless exploitation is detected.
- **Cooldown Period (`m` rounds):** Allows players to reassess after potential isolated defections, preventing indefinite punishment for single actions.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment:** Recognizes the diminishing future impact of resource depletion in later rounds, encouraging higher immediate gains.

This strategy balances sustainability with individual payoff maximization, adapting dynamically based on observed behaviors and game progression.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_219 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a collective strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observable parameters. This approach ensures adaptability to different opponent behaviors while maintaining robustness across various game states.

### Strategy Overview
The strategy is designed to maximize long-term payoffs by encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion. It dynamically adjusts decisions based on the current stock level, historical defection rates, and specific handling of edge cases like the first and last rounds.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Round (Cooperation):**
   - Begin with cooperation in the first round to set a positive precedent and encourage mutual cooperation among players.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Thresholds:** Establish thresholds relative to capacity to guide decisions.
     - High Stock (Above 80% Capacity): Cooperate if the historical defection rate is below a certain threshold, promoting sustainability.
     - Moderate Stock (Between 40% and 80% Capacity): Adjust cooperation based on both stock level and recent defection rates. If defection rates are low, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect to prevent over-depletion.
     - Low Stock (Below 40% Capacity): Increase likelihood of defecting as the resource is more vulnerable to exploitation.

3. **Defection Rate Monitoring:**
   - Use a moving average of past defection rates to smooth out volatility and avoid overreacting to short-term spikes in defection.

4. **Final Round Handling:**
   - In the last round, if the stock is sufficiently high that cooperation won't lead to significant depletion, cooperate. Otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff without causing irreversible resource damage.

### Edge Cases

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to foster a cooperative environment.
- **Last Round:** Decide based on current stock level—cooperate if sustainable, defect otherwise.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Be cautious but not entirely cooperative; allow some defection to prevent further drops while encouraging mutual cooperation in future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, n, r, round_number, history):
    # Initial parameters
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity

        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate moving average of defection rates over recent rounds (e.g., last 3)
    recent_defections = sum(1 for hist in history[-3:] for action in hist.values() if action == 'D') / (len(history[-3:]) * n) if len(history[-3:]) > 0 else 0
    
    # Decision logic
    if current_stock >= high_threshold:
        if recent_defections < 0.4:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D' if random.random() < 0.5 else 'C'
    elif low_threshold < current_stock < high_threshold:
        if recent_defections < 0.3:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        # Low stock, more likely to defect
        if round_number == r:
            # Last round: defect if possible without crashing the system
            total_consumption = n * (current_stock / n)
            new_stock = current_stock - total_consumption + 2*(current_stock - total_consumption)*(1 - (current_stock - total_consumption)/capacity)
            if new_stock < low_threshold:
                return 'C' if random.random() < 0.5 else 'D'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            return 'D' if recent_defections > 0.2 else 'C'

# Example usage
current_stock = 100
capacity = 100
n = 4
r = 10
round_number = 5
history = [previous_round_actions]  # List of dictionaries with player actions

action = decide_action(current_stock, capacity, n, r, round_number, history)
```

### Explanation
The strategy begins with cooperation to encourage a positive cycle. It then dynamically adjusts based on the stock level and historical defection rates using thresholds. By monitoring these factors and adjusting decisions accordingly, the strategy aims to sustain the common pool resource while maximizing individual payoffs over multiple rounds. This approach ensures adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors without relying on coordination mechanisms.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_220 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Threshold**

1. **Initial Play**: Start with cooperation in the first round to foster a cooperative environment and maintain the stock.

2. **Monitoring Mechanism**: Track total consumption per round to assess collective behavior:
   - Calculate total consumption as the sum of all players' actions.
   - Compare this to expected levels if all were cooperating (S/2) or defecting (S).

3. **Adaptive Decision Rules**:
   - Cooperate in rounds where total consumption indicates a cooperative trend (close to S/2).
   - Defect in rounds with significant defection (total consumption close to S), signaling the need for self-protection.

4. **Threshold Adjustment**: Dynamically adjust thresholds based on historical data to respond effectively to changing player behaviors.

5. **Endgame Handling**: In the last few rounds, consider defecting more to maximize immediate payoffs since future consequences are minimal.

6. **Collective Mindset Alignment**: Prioritize cooperation for mutual benefit while safeguarding against resource collapse due to defectors.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```python
def decision(S, history):
    if first_round:
        return C
    
    total_consumption = calculate_total(history)
    n = number_of_players()
    threshold_coop = S / 2
    threshold_defect = S
    
    if total_consumption > (threshold_coop + threshold_defect) / 2:
        return D
    else:
        return C

def endgame_handling(round_number, r):
    if rounds_remaining <= 5:
        return D
    else:
        return decision(S, history)
```

This strategy balances cooperation with adaptability, ensuring sustainable resource management while protecting against exploitation.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The designed strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation when resources are abundant while allowing defection to prevent exploitation.

1. **Initial Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale**: Preserves the resource and sets a cooperative tone for subsequent rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Check**: 
     - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
     - If below this threshold, consider Defecting (D) to exploit higher immediate gains while others may adjust their strategies.

3. **Adaptation Mechanism**:
   - **Monitor Past Actions**: Track cooperation levels from previous rounds.
   - **Switch Strategy**: If more than 50% of players Defected in the last round, switch to a Defective strategy in the next round to prevent exploitation and encourage others to Cooperate.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to foster initial cooperation.
   - **Last Round**: 
     - If stock is sufficient, Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
     - Otherwise, defect if necessary, but aim to Cooperate if possible to leave the resource in a healthier state.

5. **Stock Dynamics Consideration**:
   - Maintain awareness of how each action affects future stock levels through growth functions, aiming to keep the stock within a moderate range for sustainable payoffs.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on the current state and historical actions, promoting collective sustainability while being robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_222 = '''
**Strategic Approach for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establish trust and maximize resource growth by maintaining the stock at its sustainable level.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Observation Period:** Monitor the actions of all players in the previous rounds.
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If all players cooperated in the last two rounds, continue to Cooperate (C) to sustain the resource and maximize collective payoff.
     - If any player defected in the last round, switch to Defect (D) for the next one or two rounds as punishment. This incentivizes cooperation by making defection costly.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Consider defecting (D) due to the limited impact on future payoffs. However, if most players are still cooperating, continue Cooperating to leverage higher immediate payoffs.
   - **Rationale:** Balance between securing immediate gains and maintaining cooperative norms.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate trust-building.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Be cautious about defecting; if others are also defecting, the collective payoff diminishes. Consider continuing cooperation if it leads to higher individual payoffs.

5. **Collective Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness**
   - Players should base their actions on recent history (last 2-3 rounds).
   - If a player defects, others retaliate by defecting for one or two rounds.
   - After retaliation, return to cooperation if all players resume Cooperating, fostering a cycle of trust and cooperation.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
for each round t in {1..r}:
    if t <= 3:
        action = C
    else:
        recent_rounds = history[t-4:t]
        num_defects = count_defects(recent_rounds)
        if num_defects > threshold:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C
```

**Considerations:**
- **Stock Dynamics:** Incorporate current stock levels into decision-making. If the stock is low, Cooperating might still lead to depletion, so players may need to adjust strategies accordingly.
- **Perfect Information:** Utilize full knowledge of past actions and stock levels to inform each round's strategy.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation while deterring defection through adaptive responses.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Triggers**

The strategy balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection when necessary, adapting based on stock levels and others' actions.

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - Cooperate to build the stock and encourage sustainability.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Monitor stock level and other players' cooperation rates.
     - If stock > 60% of capacity and at least half cooperate, continue cooperating.
     - If stock < 60%, assess others' behavior:
       - Defect if others are mostly defecting or it's near the endgame.

3. **Endgame (Last 20%):**
   - Shift towards defection for immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Track cooperation rates with a focus on recent rounds.
   - Adapt thresholds based on stock and remaining rounds.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate of others (excluding self)
    other_players_coop = average Cooperation in previous rounds
    
    # Determine thresholds
    stock_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    rounds_left = total_rounds - round_number + 1
    endgame_trigger = 0.2 * total_rounds
    
    if current_stock > stock_threshold:
        if other_players_coop >= 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Potential defect impact
            potential_defect_consumption = (num_players - 1) * (defection_rate * max_consumption)
            new_stock = current_stock - potential_defect_consumption + growth(current_stock - potential_defect_consumption)
            if new_stock < stock_threshold:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
    else:
        # Low stock; check endgame and others' behavior
        if rounds_left <= endgame_trigger:
            return 'D'

            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

This strategy promotes cooperation when beneficial, adapts to group dynamics, and ensures maximum payoff in the game's final stages.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_224 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate (C). This sets a positive precedent and helps maintain a high stock level for future rounds.

2. **Assess Previous Round(s):**
   - Monitor the percentage of players who Cooperated in recent rounds to determine collective behavior trends.

3. **Decision Rule:**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If more than 60% of players Cooperated in the last few rounds, continue Cooperating.
   - **Defection Adjustment:** If fewer than 60% Cooperated, consider Defecting (D) for a round or two to incentivize others to Cooperate.

4. **Stock Consideration:**
   - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, prioritize Cooperating to allow recovery and prevent depletion.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - **Last Round:** Cooperate to maintain a sustainable resource level, even if it means lower immediate payoffs.
   - **High Stock Levels:** Maintain Cooperation to keep the stock stable.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate more aggressively to rebuild the stock.

6. **Mitigating Risks:**
   - If the stock drops below a safe threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), enforce Cooperation to rebuild resources.
   - Use a flexible cooperation threshold that adjusts based on current stock levels and historical behavior.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history_cooperations, current_stock, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate in recent rounds (e.g., last 3)
    recent_rounds = min(3, len(history_cooperations))
    cooperation_rate = sum(history_cooperations[-recent_rounds:]) / (n * recent_rounds)
    
    # Determine safe stock level
    safe_level = capacity * 0.5
    
    if current_stock < safe_level:
        return 'C'
    
    threshold = 0.6  # 60% cooperation rate required to Cooperate
    
    if cooperation_rate > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy balances the need for immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation and adjusting behavior based on collective actions and resource status.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_225 = '''
**Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase:**
   - For the first 3-5 rounds, always Cooperate (C). This helps establish a baseline of cooperation, allowing the stock to remain sustainable and providing a steady payoff.

2. **Monitoring and Detection Phase:**
   - After the initial phase, monitor the stock level and the behavior of other players.
   - Calculate the Stock Health Index (SHI) as the difference between actual stock levels and expected stock if everyone were Cooperating. A negative SHI indicates excessive consumption by others.
   - Track the Defection Rate (DR), the proportion of times other players defect in recent rounds.

3. **Adaptive Response:**
   - If SHI is significantly negative or DR exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%), increase defection probability. Start defecting more to prevent further stock depletion and protect future payoffs.
   - Use a probabilistic approach where the likelihood of defecting increases with higher DR, ensuring flexibility.

4. **Late Game Adjustment:**
   - In the last 5 rounds, prioritize immediate gains by increasing defection frequency. Since future sustainability is less critical, focus on maximizing payoff in these final rounds.

5. **Return to Cooperation:**
   - If stock health improves and DR decreases, consider returning to cooperation to sustain the resource for any remaining rounds.

6. **Edge Cases and Failsafes:**
   - Implement a failsafe to switch to defecting if the stock drops too low early on.
   - Be prepared to adapt smoothly as conditions change, avoiding rigid strategies that may fail against mixed behaviors.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with immediate payoff optimization, adapting dynamically to other players' actions while ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_226 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable resource level while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with controlled defection based on observed stock levels and historical player behavior. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation to establish a stable stock level and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Stock Threshold Monitoring**:
   - **Low Stock (Cooperate)**: If the current stock is below 60% of capacity (`threshold = capacity * 0.6`), cooperate to aid in regrowth.
   - **Decreasing Trend (Cooperate)**: Monitor recent stock levels; if they show a decreasing trend over the past few rounds, switch to cooperation to prevent further decline.

3. **Defector Monitoring**:
   - Examine the number of defectors in recent rounds (e.g., the last 3 rounds).
   - If more than half (`n / 2`) of the players have been defecting recently, defect to avoid being exploited by others who are not cooperating.

4. **Adjustments Based on Behavior**:
   - Cooperate if the stock is stable and defectors are in the minority.
   - Defect cautiously when others are defecting, but be mindful of the potential for causing resource depletion.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history):
    threshold = capacity * 0.6  # Example threshold value
    k_recent_rounds = 3         # Number of recent rounds to consider
    defector_threshold = n // 2  # Majority threshold for defecting
    
    if current_stock < threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif is_stock_decreasing(history[-k_recent_rounds:]):
        return 'C'
    else:
        recent_defectors = count_defectors_in(history[-k_recent_rounds:])
        if recent_defectors > defector_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts by cooperating to build a stable resource base.
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Cooperates when the stock is low or decreasing, ensuring sustainability.
- **Defector Adjustment**: Defects only when a significant number of players are defecting, preventing exploitation while considering collective impact.

This strategy aims to sustain the resource while protecting against exploitation, promoting a balance between individual gain and communal well-being.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_227 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Tit-for-Tat Mechanism**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start by encouraging others to cooperate, setting a cooperative tone.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-5%):**
   - **Step 1: Assess Previous Round's Cooperation Rate:**
     - Calculate the percentage of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Step 2: Decision Making Based on Cooperation Rate:**
     - If more than 70% of players Cooperated last round, continue to Cooperate this round. This promotes sustainability and maintains resource levels for future rounds.
     - If less than or equal to 30% of players Cooperated, switch to Defecting this round as a form of retaliation to signal against exploitation.
   - **Step 3: Moderate Response (Optional):**
     - For cooperation rates between 31-70%, consider a mixed strategy where you cooperate with a decreasing probability based on the drop in cooperation. This can help incentivize others to maintain cooperative behavior without fully defecting.

3. **Endgame Handling (Last 5% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** With limited future rounds left, there's less incentive to sustain the resource, so defecting maximizes immediate payoffs.

4. **Forgiveness Mechanism (Optional):**
   - After consecutive rounds of low cooperation, consider reverting to Cooperate in one round to attempt re-establishing a cooperative environment.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate from previous round
    last_coop = sum(history[round_number-2])
    coop_rate = last_coop / n
    
    # Near endgame
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds * 0.05):
        return 'D'
    
    # Decide based on cooperation rate
    if coop_rate > 0.7:
        return 'C'
    elif coop_rate < 0.3:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Mixed strategy: probabilistic cooperation
        prob_coop = max(0, 1 - (1 - coop_rate) * 2)
        if random.random() < prob_coop:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage:
current_round = 5
total_rounds = 20
history = [[], [4]]  # Assuming history[round] gives count of Cooperators
action = decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, history)
```

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on historical behavior, promoting collective sustainability while deterring exploitation. It ensures long-term resource management by encouraging others to cooperate through positive reinforcement and mild retaliation when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_228 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The proposed strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively responding to others' actions and current resource levels. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate in the first three rounds to encourage a cooperative environment.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Level Check:** If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, always Cooperate to aid regrowth.
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** When the stock is above 50%, evaluate cooperation based on previous rounds:
     - If more than 60% of players Cooperated in the last round, Cooperate this round.
     - Otherwise, Defect.

3. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - The strategy adapts to others' behavior while ensuring resource sustainability when levels are low.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock_history, actions_history):
    n = number_of_players()
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    
    # Initial rounds: Cooperate
    if len(actions_history) < 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if stock is low
    if current_stock <= capacity * 0.5:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation proportion in last round
    last_round_actions = actions_history[-1]
    cooperator_count = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    coopperation_proportion = cooperator_count / n
    
    # Decide based on cooperation threshold
    if coopperation_proportion >= 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts by Cooperating to foster a cooperative atmosphere, which is crucial for maintaining resource levels.
- **Stock Threshold:** When the stock is low (below 50%), Cooperating helps in regenerating the resource, ensuring future sustainability.
- **Tit-for-Tat Adaptation:** By Cooperating if others did so in the majority and Defecting otherwise, the strategy encourages mutual cooperation while deterring excessive defection.

This approach aims to maximize personal payoff while contributing to collective resource management.

description_COLLECTIVE_229 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on past behavior and current resource levels. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - *Reasoning:* Sets a cooperative tone, promoting stability and encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Past Behavior:**
     - Track the number of players who cooperated in the previous k rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds).
   - **Determine Cooperation Rate:**
     - Calculate the cooperation rate as the percentage of players who cooperated.
   - **Decision Making:**
     - If the cooperation rate is above a threshold (e.g., 50%), continue to Cooperate.
     - If below the threshold, Defect to punish defectors and encourage future cooperation.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Consider defecting if possible.
     - *Reasoning:* Since there are no future rounds, defecting may yield higher immediate payoffs without long-term consequences on resource depletion.

4. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - **When Stock is Low (<80% of capacity):**
     - Prioritize Cooperating to facilitate stock regeneration and avoid further depletion.
   - **When Stock is High (≥80% of capacity):**
     - Base decisions more on past behavior, as the resource can sustain moderate consumption.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number < total_rounds:
        # Calculate cooperation rate in recent rounds
        recent_coop = sum(1 for h in history[-k:] if h.count('C') >= n/2)
        coop_rate = recent_coop / k
        if current_stock < 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif coop_rate > threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Last round
        return 'D'

# Example parameters
k = 3  # Look back at last 3 rounds
threshold = 0.5  # Cooperate if >=50% of recent actions were cooperative
```

### Summary

This strategy starts with cooperation to foster a stable environment, adapts based on the observed behavior of others, and considers the current state of the resource to maintain sustainability. By dynamically adjusting actions, it aims to maximize long-term payoffs while encouraging collective responsibility towards the common pool.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to promote sustainability and fairness by balancing immediate payoffs with long-term resource preservation. It adapts based on the current stock level and its trends, without relying on others' strategies.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**

- **Initial Rounds (First 2 rounds):**  
  Always Cooperate to establish a baseline and observe system dynamics.

- **Middle Rounds:**  
  - Calculate the difference in stock from the previous round (ΔS = current_stock - last_round_stock).
  - If ΔS is positive or stable:  
    - Cooperate if the current stock is above 60% of capacity.
    - Defect moderately (with a probability decreasing as stock approaches 80%) if above 70% to test impact without risking depletion.
  - If ΔS is negative (stock decreased):  
    - Switch to full Cooperation to allow regrowth.

- **Last Few Rounds:**  
  Cooperate aggressively to preserve remaining stock, ensuring some payoff in final rounds.

---

### **2. Threshold Adjustments**

- Use dynamic thresholds adjusting based on past trends:
  - If over recent rounds, stock consistently stays below 70%, lower threshold to 60% for more conservative behavior.
  - Adjust defect probability inversely with stock level above 70%.

---

### **3. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Cooperate unconditionally.
- **Last Round(s):** Cooperate to maximize collective payoff without future concerns.
- If stock reaches zero (unlikely given initial conditions), all players cooperate in subsequent rounds to allow regrowth.

---

### **4. Pseudocode for Decision-Making**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, last_round_stock):
    if round_number <= 2:
        return 'C'
    else:
        delta_s = current_stock - last_round_stock
        threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
        threshold_low = 0.6 * capacity
        
        # Calculate dynamic thresholds based on history
        recent_trend = calculate_recent_trend()
        if recent_trend == 'decreasing':
            threshold_low *= 0.9
            
        if delta_s >= 0:
            if current_stock > threshold_high:
                return 'D'  # Defect with lower probability as stock increases beyond high threshold
            elif current_stock > threshold_low:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'C'  # Cooperate to allow regrowth
        else:  # Stock decreased last round
            return 'C'
```

---

### **5. Summary of Strategy**

This strategy adapts dynamically, starting with cooperation to observe system behavior, then adjusting based on stock trends and thresholds to balance payoffs and sustainability. It's robust against various opponent behaviors by focusing on observable state changes rather than specific strategies.

**Final Answer:**  
The adaptive strategy begins with cooperation in the first two rounds, then adjusts actions based on stock levels and trends, maintaining a conservative approach when the stock is low and allowing moderate defection when the stock is high. It ensures long-term sustainability while balancing immediate gains.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_231 = '''
To address the problem of resource management among players, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation for sustainability with defection to maximize individual payoffs, particularly in the final round. The solution is structured as follows:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Steady State Stock Level:**
   - The logistic growth model indicates that the maximum sustainable stock level (where growth equals consumption) occurs at 75% of the initial capacity (0.75 * capacity). This is calculated by setting the growth rate equal to total consumption and solving for S.

2. **Determine the Cooperation Threshold:**
   - Players will Cooperate if the current stock level (S) exceeds this sustainable threshold (0.75 * capacity). This ensures that resource depletion does not occur beyond recovery, maintaining a healthy stock for future rounds.

3. **Defection Strategy:**
   - When the stock level drops to or below 75% of capacity, players will Defect. This allows them to maximize their individual payoffs in the short term while acknowledging that the resource is already being depleted.

4. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - In the last round, regardless of the current stock level, all players will Defect. This decision prioritizes maximizing immediate gains since there are no future rounds affected by depletion.

**Decision Rule Implementation:**

- For each round except the last:
  - If S > 0.75 * capacity → Cooperate (take S/(2n))
  - Else → Defect (take S/n)
  
- In the final round:
  - Regardless of S → Defect (take S/n)

**Edge Cases Addressed:**

- **First Round:** The stock starts at full capacity, which is above the sustainable threshold. Players Cooperate to maintain a healthy resource level.
- **Last Round:** All players defect to maximize their individual payoffs without concern for future rounds.

This strategy ensures a balance between maintaining a sustainable resource and maximizing personal gain, particularly in the final round where future considerations are irrelevant.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_232 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Sustainability Strategy (ASS)

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoffs while ensuring the sustainability of the common pool resource over multiple rounds through adaptive cooperation and defection based on stock dynamics.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C).
     - *Reasoning:* Start with a sustainable approach to maintain the stock for future rounds, encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **If the current stock is increasing or stable compared to the previous round:**
     - Cooperate (C).
       - *Reasoning:* Sustainable consumption indicates that cooperation is effective, so continue promoting collective sustainability.
   - **If the current stock decreases by more than a threshold (e.g., 10% of capacity) compared to the previous round:**
     - Defect (D) in this round and potentially subsequent rounds until:
       - The stock begins to recover or stabilize.
       - *Reasoning:* A significant decrease signals over-exploitation, necessitating short-term defection to signal the need for balance.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Cooperate (C).
     - *Reasoning:* Maintain consistency and avoid a "race to deplete" in the last round, which could set a negative precedent if the game were to continue.

---

### **Handling Edge Cases:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate (C) to encourage sustainable behavior from the start.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Always Cooperate (C) to avoid sudden depletion and maintain trust in collective efforts.

3. **Stock Near Capacity or Zero:**
   - If stock is near capacity, continue Cooperating (C) to prevent over-consumption.
   - If stock is near zero, consider Defecting (D) only if others are also defecting excessively; otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).

---

### **Collective Mindset Alignment:**

- ASS promotes a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.
- By adapting actions based on stock trends, players signal the importance of moderation to others.
- The strategy fosters trust by consistently rewarding cooperation when it leads to sustainable outcomes.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, previous_stocks):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if len(previous_stocks) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Last round: Cooperate
    if current_round == total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate stock change from the last round
    previous_stock = previous_stocks[-1]
    stock_change = (current_stock - previous_stock)
    
    # Threshold for significant decrease (adjust as needed)
    threshold_decrease = 0.1 * capacity
    
    if stock_change > 0 or abs(stock_change) < threshold_decrease:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Note: The above pseudocode is a simplified version; actual implementation would require tracking all previous stocks and considering the broader context.
```

---

### **Summary of Strategy:**

- **Initial and Final Rounds:** Cooperate to set a positive tone and avoid last-round depletion.
- **Middle Rounds:** Adapt based on stock trends, Cooperating when sustainable and Defecting when necessary to signal over-exploitation.
- **Collective Goal:** Promote balance between individual gain and resource sustainability through adaptive behavior.

This strategy is robust because it aligns with the collective interest of maintaining a healthy common pool while allowing for adaptability in response to others' actions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_233 = '''
To address this problem, we need to design a strategy that allows each player to decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the observed state of a shared resource. The goal is to maintain cooperation among players to prevent rapid depletion of the resource while allowing for adaptation if others start defecting.

### Approach
The approach involves using a threshold-based strategy where each player observes the current stock level of the resource. If the stock level is above or equal to a predefined threshold, indicating that other players are cooperating sufficiently, the player chooses to cooperate. If the stock level falls below this threshold, it suggests that some players are defecting, leading the player to switch to defection.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_cooperate(stock_level, capacity):
    # Define the threshold as 90% of capacity
    threshold = 0.9 * capacity
    return stock_level >= threshold

# Example usage:
capacity = 100  # Total resource capacity
current_stock = 85  # Current observed stock level

if decide_cooperate(current_stock, capacity):
    print("Cooperate")
else:
    print("Defect")
```

### Explanation
- **Threshold Definition**: The threshold is set to 90% of the total resource capacity. This buffer allows for minor fluctuations in the stock level without immediately triggering a switch to defection.
- **Decision Logic**: Each player checks if the current stock level is above or equal to the defined threshold. If it is, they cooperate by using the resource sustainably. If not, they defect to maximize their immediate gain before the resource is depleted.

This strategy balances between maintaining cooperation when possible and adapting to situations where others are defecting, thereby preventing rapid resource depletion while allowing for individual optimization based on observed conditions.

description_COLLECTIVE_234 = '''
To approach this problem optimally, one should balance maintaining the resource for sustainable payoffs with maximizing immediate gains. Here's a step-by-step explanation and answer:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in every round except the last to maintain the resource level, ensuring maximum growth and sustained payoffs.

2. **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, defect to maximize your payoff since there are no future consequences of depleting the resource.

3. **Monitor Resource Levels**: Keep track of the resource stock (S). If S drops significantly below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), consider defecting earlier to prevent further depletion and secure higher immediate payoffs before potential collapse.

**Answer**: The optimal strategy is to cooperate in all rounds except the last, where you should defect. Additionally, monitor the resource level; if it drops below a critical threshold, defect early to maximize your payoff while preventing complete depletion. This approach balances sustaining the resource with securing maximum gains when possible.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold Adjustments**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Rounds (First 10%):** Cooperate unconditionally to build a high stock level, encouraging others to follow suit.
   - **Middle Rounds:** Use dynamic thresholds based on current stock and past cooperation:
     - **Cooperate** if the stock is above 75% of capacity.
     - **Adjust Cooperation/Defection** between 25%-75% based on recent trends (e.g., decreasing stock leads to reduced cooperation).
     - **Defect** if the stock drops below 25% to prevent collapse.
   - **Last 10% Rounds:** Increase defection rate, but cooperate if the stock remains above a certain level.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a high starting point.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Allow more defection as future impact diminishes, while still cooperating if beneficial.

3. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   - Prioritizes long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation when stock is healthy.
   - Adapts dynamically to changing conditions and collective behavior, balancing immediate gains with future viability.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    # Initial threshold setup
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity

    if round_number <= total_rounds / 10:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number >= (total_rounds - total_rounds / 10):
        # Final rounds: increase defection
        if stock_level > high_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        # Middle rounds: adjust based on stock and history
        if stock_level > high_threshold:
            recent_coop = calculate_recent_cooperation(history)
            if recent_coop > 0.7:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        elif low_threshold < stock_level <= high_threshold:
            trend = calculate_stock_trend(history)
            if trend == 'increasing':
                return 'C'
            elif trend == 'decreasing' and stock_level > (low_threshold + 10):
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        else:
            # Stock below low threshold
            return 'D'

def calculate_recent_cooperation(history):
    # Analyze recent rounds for cooperation rate among others
    pass

def calculate_stock_trend(history):
    # Determine if stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable
    pass
```

This strategy dynamically adjusts based on the current state and past behavior, promoting collective sustainability while being resilient to various opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_236 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation based on current stock levels and historical player behavior. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Begin with maximum cooperation by setting the initial threshold (Thresh) equal to the capacity.
   - Use a dynamic threshold that adapts to other players' actions over time.

2. **Decision Making Each Round:**
   - Check the current stock level (S).
   - Cooperate if S is above Thresh; defect otherwise.

3. **Updating Threshold:**
   - Track historical cooperation rates of other players using a moving average (e.g., 10% of past rounds or a recent window).
   - Adjust Thresh based on others' behavior:
     - Higher Thresh if others cooperate more.
     - Lower Thresh if others defect more.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate fully as there's no prior history.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., 5% of total rounds):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future sustainability.

### Pseudocode:
```python
Initialize Thresh = capacity
history = []
coop_rate = 0.5  # Initial estimate

for each round t in r:
    S = current_stock()
    
    if len(history) == 0:
        action = C
    else:
        average_coop = sum([h['coop'] for h in history]) / len(history)
        coop_rate = 0.1 * average_coop + 0.9 * coop_rate  # Exponential moving average
    
    if t >= r - (r // 20):  # Last few rounds
        action = D
    else:
        Thresh = capacity * max(0.5, (coop_rate))  # Adjust based on others' cooperation
        if S > Thresh:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    
    play(action)
    record_opponent_actions()
    
Update history with current actions and coop_rate.
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Adaptability:** The strategy adapts to shifts in opponents' behavior, allowing it to cooperate when others do and defect as necessary.
- **Sustainability vs. Exploitation:** Balances immediate gains from defection with the need to conserve resources for future rounds.
- **Robustness:** Functions without relying on coordination or prior knowledge of opponent strategies.

This approach ensures a responsive and adaptive strategy, capable of thriving in diverse competitive environments while maintaining a focus on long-term sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_237 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation and defection in order to maintain a sustainable resource level while maximizing individual gains, we propose an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts based on the current state of the resource. This strategy aims to prevent over-depletion by encouraging cooperation when the resource is healthy and allowing defection when necessary.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set a dynamic threshold `T`, initially at 75% of the total capacity (e.g., T = 0.75 * C).
   - Begin by Cooperating in the first few rounds to build up the resource level.

2. **Resource Monitoring:**
   - After each round, calculate the remaining resource (`S_remaining`) after consumption.
   - Track recent trends of `S_remaining` over a defined number of past rounds (e.g., 5-10 rounds) to determine if the resource is increasing, decreasing, or stable.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - If the trend indicates that `S_remaining` has been increasing over the past rounds, raise the threshold `T` towards a higher value (e.g., 90% of capacity).
   - Conversely, if `S_remaining` is decreasing, lower the threshold `T` to encourage more cooperation and prevent further decline.

4. **Cooperation vs. Defection Decision:**
   - For each subsequent round:
     - If `S_remaining` >= `T` and the trend shows stability or an increase, decide to Cooperate.
     - If `S_remaining` < `T` or there is a decreasing trend, switch to Defecting to capture immediate gains while allowing others' cooperation to rebuild the resource.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds (or another predefined endgame phase), switch to Defecting to maximize individual gains since there's no future benefit in maintaining a high resource level.

6. **Implementation and Adaptation:**
   - Continuously monitor `S_remaining` and adjust the strategy based on observed trends.
   - Fine-tune the threshold adjustments (e.g., how much to increase or decrease `T`) based on simulation results and performance metrics.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy involves dynamically adjusting between cooperation and defection based on the current state of the resource. Initially, cooperate to build up the resource. Monitor the remaining stock after each round, and if it falls below a certain threshold or shows a decreasing trend, switch to defecting. In the final stages, defect to maximize gains.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Adaptively Cooperate when above Threshold T, else Defect}}

description_COLLECTIVE_238 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that encourages cooperation while deterring defection through strategic mechanisms. Here's a structured outline of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation and deterring defection. It uses a dynamic threshold system based on past actions and current stock levels.

### Key Components:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Begin with Cooperate (C) in the first round to foster a cooperative environment and set a positive tone for future interactions.

2. **Monitoring and Scoring System:**
   - Track each player's actions over time.
   - Calculate a cooperation score based on the number of players who cooperated, weighted by their impact on the stock.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds:**
   - Establish thresholds for acceptable levels of defection. If the observed defection exceeds these thresholds, switch to Defect (D) in subsequent rounds as punishment.
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on the current stock level and remaining rounds to balance immediate needs with future sustainability.

4. **Stock Level Considerations:**
   - When the stock is high, maintain a cooperative stance to preserve resources for future rounds.
   - As the stock depletes, adjust strategies to either continue cooperation (to encourage replenishment) or defect (to prevent further loss).

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Start with C to set a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Round:** Consider continuing cooperation if it maintains sustainability; otherwise, allow for defection as there's no future punishment.

6. **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
   - Be cautious of sudden changes in behavior but remain vigilant against persistent defection. Forgiveness is extended to occasional defectors but not to repeat offenders.

### Pseudocode Outline:
```python
def strategy(player_index, history, stock_level, capacity, current_round, total_rounds):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    cooperation_score = calculate_cooperation_score(history)
    stock_threshold = determine_stock_threshold(stock_level, capacity, current_round, total_rounds)
    
    if cooperation_score < stock_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

def calculate_cooperation_score(history):
    # Calculate based on past actions and their impact
    pass

def determine_stock_threshold(stock_level, capacity, current_round, total_rounds):
    # Dynamic threshold calculation considering stock level and rounds remaining
    pass
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy is designed to be adaptive, encouraging cooperation while deterring defection through strategic punishment. It dynamically adjusts based on past actions and current stock levels, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability. By incorporating mechanisms for monitoring, scoring, and dynamic thresholds, the strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment while safeguarding against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_239 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a strategy that promotes cooperation while maintaining adaptability to different scenarios. The strategy is designed to maximize long-term payoffs by balancing immediate gains with resource sustainability.

### Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative Defection (ACD)

**Objective**: Maximize cumulative payoff over multiple rounds by promoting cooperation when sustainable and defecting when necessary, based on stock levels and historical player behavior.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to encourage a stable resource level and build trust among players.

2. **Stock Threshold Check**: Each round, evaluate the current stock against predefined thresholds:
   - **High Stock (Above 75% of capacity)**: Continue Cooperating as the resource is sustainable.
   - **Moderate Stock (Between 25% and 75% of capacity)**: Cooperate if most players did so in the previous round; otherwise, Defect to prevent exploitation.
   - **Low Stock (Below 25% of capacity)**: Switch to Defecting to minimize losses as recovery is unlikely.

3. **Recent Player Behavior**: Track the proportion of Cooperators from recent rounds:
   - If more than 70% of players Cooperated in the last round, continue Cooperating.
   - Otherwise, switch to Defecting to avoid being exploited by Defectors.

4. **Round Progression Adjustment**:
   - In the first 25% of rounds, prioritize Cooperation to build a sustainable resource base.
   - In the middle 50%, adapt based on stock levels and player behavior.
   - In the final 25% of rounds, be more lenient towards Defecting since future payoffs are limited.

### Edge Cases

- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Few Rounds (Final 10%)**: Players may defect more as future payoffs diminish. The strategy allows for more defection here to capitalize on remaining resources.
- **Stock at Capacity or Near Zero**:
   - At capacity, Cooperate to maintain high growth potential.
   - Near zero, Defect since little resource remains for sustainable use.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players()
    cooperation_threshold = 0.7  # 70% of players Cooperated in the last round
    stock_high = capacity * 0.75
    stock_low = capacity * 0.25
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    recent_rounds = history[-3:]  # Look at the past 3 rounds
    num_coop = sum(1 for r in recent_rounds for action in r.values() if action == 'C')
    coop_proportion = num_coop / (n * len(recent_rounds))
    
    if stock > stock_high:
        return 'C'
    elif stock_low <= stock <= stock_high:
        if coop_proportion >= cooperation_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # stock < stock_low
        return 'D'
    
    # Additional adjustment for final rounds
    if round_number > total_rounds * 0.9:
        return 'D'
```

### Summary

The Adaptive Cooperative Defection strategy begins with Cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base, then adapts based on current stock levels and recent player behavior. It promotes long-term cooperation by encouraging mutual benefits while defending against exploitation. The strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors and ensures adaptability across different game stages.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_240 = '''
The optimal collective strategy balances cooperation with defecting based on current resource levels and recent player behavior:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set high threshold (H) at 80% of capacity and low threshold (L) at 40%.
   - Monitor the last 5 rounds for defector proportion.

2. **Decision Rules Each Round:**
   - If stock ≥ H and recent defectors < 30%, Cooperate.
   - If stock ≤ L or recent defectors > 30%, Defect.
   - Else, follow majority cooperation in recent rounds.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Adjust thresholds based on stock trend to encourage sustainability.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is for each player to:

- Cooperate when the current stock exceeds 80% of capacity and less than 30% of recent actions were defects.
- Defect if the stock drops below 40%, or if more than 30% of recent actions were defects.
- If conditions are intermediate, follow the majority cooperation observed in recent rounds.

This strategy balances resource sustainability with individual payoff incentives while adapting to changing conditions.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when stock >80% and <30% recent defects; else Defect}}

To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a scenario where actions affect future states, I propose an adaptive strategy that switches between cooperation and defection based on current conditions and past trends. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate to establish a positive baseline and encourage others to do likewise.

2. **Adaptive Behavior in Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **High Stock Level (S > 80% capacity):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since the stock can sustain higher consumption.
   - **Moderate Stock Level (40% < S ≤ 80%):**
     - Assess the trend of stock levels over the past k rounds (e.g., last 3).
     - If the average change in stock (delta_S) is negative, Cooperate to help rebuild the stock.
     - If delta_S is positive or stable, Defect to exploit the current resource abundance.
   - **Low Stock Level (S ≤ 40%):** Always Cooperate to prevent further depletion and facilitate recovery.

3. **Final Round Exploitation:**
   - In the last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start by Cooperating in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.

2. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Maintain a buffer of past stock levels (e.g., last 3 rounds).
   - Calculate the average delta_S over this period to determine if the stock is increasing, stable, or decreasing.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - Use thresholds and trend analysis to decide between Cooperating and Defecting:
     - High S allows for defecting without risking collapse.
     - Moderate S requires balancing based on recent trends.
     - Low S necessitates cooperation to rebuild.

4. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - Switch to defecting in the final round to capitalize on remaining resources without worrying about future impacts.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Round 1:** Cooperate → Establishes a cooperative baseline.
- **Round 2:** If stock is high (e.g., 90%), Defect for higher payoff.
- **Round 3:** If stock drops moderately (e.g., to 70%) but trend shows decline, switch to Cooperating.
- **Round r-1:** Continue adjusting based on current S and trends.
- **Round r:** Defect to maximize final payoff.

This strategy dynamically adapts to changing conditions, ensuring both immediate gains and long-term sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_242 = '''
To address the problem of determining when to cooperate or defect in a repeated game involving a shared resource, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy for Cooperation and Defection

1. **Initial Threshold Setup**:
   - Begin with a high threshold \( T \) close to the initial capacity of the resource. For example, set \( T = 0.9 \times \text{capacity} \).

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**:
   - Gradually decrease \( T \) as the number of remaining rounds decreases. This adjustment can be linear or exponential, ensuring that the threshold becomes more lenient towards defection in later rounds.

3. **Cooperation Decision**:
   - In each round, if the current stock \( S_t \) is greater than or equal to \( T \), cooperate by consuming your fair share of the resource.
   - If \( S_t < T \), defect by consuming as much as possible to maximize immediate gain.

4. **Behavioral Adjustment**:
   - Observe the proportion of players who defected in previous rounds. If a significant majority (e.g., more than 50%) defected, consider adjusting your strategy to be more likely to defect even if \( S_t \) is above \( T \). This adjustment helps prevent being exploited by persistent defectors.

### Explanation

- **Sustainability Focus**: By starting with a high threshold, the strategy encourages cooperation when the resource is abundant, promoting sustainability and maintaining higher payoffs over time.
  
- **Adaptability to Defection**: The dynamic adjustment of \( T \) allows the strategy to adapt to changing conditions. As rounds progress, especially nearing the end, the threshold lowers, making defection more appealing if the resource has been depleted significantly by others.

- **Incentive Alignment**: Observing and responding to other players' actions ensures that the strategy doesn't blindly cooperate when others are exploiting the resource. This balance helps prevent being taken advantage of while still fostering cooperation when beneficial.

This approach effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on the current state of the resource and the observed behavior of other players. It aims to maximize individual payoffs while encouraging collective resource management.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the stock is above a decreasing threshold; otherwise, defect.}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_243 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Threshold Strategy**

Our strategy employs an adaptive threshold approach to balance between cooperation and defection dynamically based on the current state of the common pool resource and historical play patterns.

### **1. Decision Rules:**
- **Cooperate (C):** If the current stock level is above the dynamic threshold \( T \), cooperate.
- **Defect (D):** If the current stock level is below or equal to \( T \), defect.

### **2. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
The threshold \( T \) adapts after each round based on the following rules:
- **Increase \( T \):** If in the previous round, there was a significant decrease in the stock (indicating higher consumption due to defection) or if the number of defectors increased.
- **Decrease \( T \):** If the stock increased significantly, indicating that cooperation is sustainable and allowing for a lower threshold.

### **3. Initialization:**
- Start with an initial threshold \( T_0 = \text{capacity} / 2 \). This serves as a midpoint, encouraging moderate cooperation while allowing room for adaptation.

### **4. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate since the stock is at its maximum capacity.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** Adjust \( T \) based on historical consumption and stock growth/shrinkage.
- **Unknown Last Round:** Treat each round as potentially the last, balancing between maximizing immediate payoff and preserving the resource for future rounds.

### **5. Implementation Steps:**
1. **Initialize Parameters:**
   - Set initial threshold \( T = \text{capacity} / 2 \).
   - Track historical stock levels and player actions.

2. **Each Round:**
   a. Observe current stock level \( S \).
   b. Determine action (C or D) based on whether \( S > T \).

3. **Adjust Threshold After Each Round:**
   a. Calculate the change in stock.
   b. If stock decreased significantly, increase \( T \) to encourage more cooperation.
   c. If stock increased, decrease \( T \) slightly to allow for more sustainable harvesting.

4. **Adaptation Smoothing:**
   - Use a smoothing factor to prevent abrupt changes in \( T \), ensuring gradual adjustments based on trends over multiple rounds.

### **6. Pseudocode:**

```python
# Initialize parameters
capacity = game_capacity
T = capacity / 2
history_length = 5  # Number of past rounds considered for adjustment

for each round in r:
    S = current_stock_level()
    
    if S > T:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        action = 'D'
    
    record_action(action)
    
    # After the round, adjust threshold based on previous history
    recent_history = get_last_n_rounds(history_length)
    stock_change = calculate_stock_change(recent_history)
    
    if stock_change < 0:  # Stock decreased
        T += abs(stock_change) * 0.1  # Increase threshold to encourage more cooperation
    elif stock_change > 0 and S > capacity / 2:
        T -= stock_change * 0.05  # Decrease threshold slightly if sustainable
    
    # Ensure T stays within reasonable bounds
    T = max(T, capacity / 4)
    T = min(T, 3 * capacity / 4)
```

### **7. Benefits:**
- **Adaptability:** The strategy dynamically adjusts to different player behaviors and stock conditions.
- **Sustainability:** Encourages cooperation when the resource is sufficient, promoting long-term sustainability.
- **Protection Against Exploitation:** Adjusts by defecting if others exploit the resource excessively, preventing premature depletion.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining collective resource health through adaptive decision-making.

description_COLLECTIVE_244 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to conserve the resource pool, ensuring higher stock levels for subsequent rounds and encouraging potential cooperation from other players.

2. **Adaptive Defection Threshold**: In each subsequent round:
   - Observe the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - If the number of defectors is below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 1/3 of total players), defect to maximize individual payoff while maintaining resource sustainability.
   - If the number of defectors exceeds this threshold, cooperate to prevent further depletion and allow the stock to recover.

3. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last few rounds (specifically the final 20% of rounds):
   - Increase cooperation to preserve the remaining stock, anticipating that other players might defect more as the game concludes.
   - This adjustment aims to mitigate rapid resource exhaustion, ensuring a balanced payoff distribution in the closing rounds.

**Implementation Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock, n_players):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate initially to conserve resources
    
    prev_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'D')
    threshold = n_players / 3  # Example threshold adjustment
    
    if round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 5):  # Last 20% of rounds
        return 'C'  # Cooperate more to prevent stock crash
    
    if prev_defectors < threshold:
        return 'D'  # Defect if few others did, to gain more
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate if many defected to preserve resources
```

This strategy balances individual gains with collective resource management, adapting dynamically to other players' behaviors and adjusting near the game's end to prevent abrupt depletions.

To address the problem of maintaining cooperation while preventing excessive resource depletion in a multi-round game with perfect information, we propose a strategy that balances individual incentives with collective sustainability.

### Approach
The strategy is designed to encourage players to cooperate when it benefits the group and to defect only when necessary. It incorporates feedback from recent gameplay and current stock levels to dynamically adjust decisions. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase**: Players start by cooperating for the first 10% of rounds to build a healthy resource base.
2. **Dynamic Decision Making**: For each subsequent round, players assess the cooperation rate among others in recent rounds and the current stock level. They cooperate if enough others are cooperating and the stock is sufficiently high; otherwise, they defect.
3. **Personal Cooldown Mechanism**: To prevent excessive defection by any single player, individuals track their own recent actions and force cooperation after a certain number of defects.
4. **Final Cooperation Phase**: In the last 10% of rounds, players always cooperate to maximize remaining payoffs.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history_coop, my_defects, current_round, r=100):
    # Parameters
    FIRST_PHASE = int(0.1 * r)
    LAST_PHASE = int(0.9 * r)
    n_recent = 3  # Number of past rounds to consider for cooperation rate
    threshold_coop_rate = 0.6  # Minimum proportion of cooperators needed to cooperate
    cooldown_defects = 2  # Max defects in last 5 rounds before forcing coop
    
    if current_round <= FIRST_PHASE or current_round >= LAST_PHASE:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among all players
    total_players = len(history_coop[0])
    recent_coop = sum([sum(round_coop) for round_coop in history_coop[-n_recent:]])
    avg_coop = recent_coop / (n_recent * total_players)
    
    # Personal cooldown check
    if sum(my_defects[-5:]) >= cooldown_defects:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate thresholds based on current stock
    capacity = 100  # Assuming max capacity is 100 for example
    low_stock_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    medium_low = 0.4 * capacity
    medium_high = 0.6 * capacity

    if current_stock > high_stock_threshold:
        stock_threshold = medium_high
    elif current_stock < low_stock_threshold:
        stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    else:
        stock_threshold = current_stock / 2
    
    # Decision based on cooperation rate and stock level
    if avg_coop > threshold_coop_rate and current_stock > stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Phase**: Ensures the resource starts at a healthy level, encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Dynamic Decision Making**: Uses recent cooperation rates and current stock levels to decide actions. Cooperates if enough players are cooperating and the stock is sufficient; defects otherwise.
- **Personal Cooldown**: Prevents individual players from defecting too much in succession, maintaining overall resource health.
- **Final Phase**: Maximizes payoffs by ensuring cooperation when there's little future impact.

This strategy aims to balance individual gain with collective sustainability, promoting a stable cooperative environment unless conditions justify defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_246 = '''
**Final Answer:**

To design a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that is adaptive and robust, we can outline the following approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy focuses on maintaining sustainability through cooperation while adapting to potential defection. It uses observable state variables (stock level) and historical cooperation rates to decide actions.

---

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **Default Action:** Cooperate (C) in each round.
- **Switching Condition:** Defect (D) if the stock falls below a critical threshold, indicating excessive depletion.

**Pseudocode for Decision Making:**
```python
def decide_action(stock, history_coop_rate, round_number):
    # Parameters
    LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD = 0.3 * capacity
    HIGH_DEFECT_RATE = 0.6
    FINAL_ROUNDS = 5

    # Early rounds: prioritize cooperation for sustainability
    if round_number <= r // 2:
        return C

    # Check stock level and historical defect rate
    if stock < LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD or history_coop_rate < HIGH_DEFECT_RATE:
        return D

    # In the last few rounds, be cautious
    if round_number > r - FINAL_ROUNDS:
        return D if stock < 0.5 * capacity else C

    # Default to cooperation
    return C
```

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to encourage sustainability and set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds):** Switch to D if the stock is below 50% of capacity, preventing others from depleting it further.

---

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

The strategy aligns with a collective mindset by:
- Encouraging cooperation to maintain resource sustainability.
- Adapting to potential defection by monitoring stock levels and cooperation rates.
- Balancing individual payoffs with the need to preserve the common pool for future rounds.

---

### Conclusion:
This strategy promotes long-term sustainability while being adaptive to different opponent behaviors. By focusing on observable indicators, it ensures robustness without relying on coordination mechanisms or specific patterns from other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_247 = '''
The proposed strategy for managing cooperation and defection in the context of maintaining sustainable stock levels is as follows:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and sustainability.

2. **Monitor Consumption**: After each round, calculate the expected consumption under full cooperation (E = previous_stock / 2) and compare it with the actual consumption (A). Track whether A exceeds E over consecutive rounds.

3. **Punishment Phase Trigger**: If there are k consecutive rounds where A > E, switch to defecting for m rounds as a punitive measure against excessive defection. This aims to incentivize others to revert to cooperation.

4. **Recovery Check**: During the punishment phase, monitor if consumption drops below E or if stock levels show signs of recovery. If so after m rounds, reset and return to cooperating.

5. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the final p% of rounds, prioritize cooperation to maintain stock levels despite the nearing end of the game, promoting sustainable practices until the conclusion.

This strategy adapts dynamically, encouraging cooperation when possible and switching to defection as a corrective measure against excessive resource exploitation, thereby balancing sustainability with punitive incentives.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_248 = '''
The strategy outlined below aims to balance between cooperation and defection based on historical actions and the current state of the common pool. It is designed to adapt dynamically, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion or punish defectors.

---

### **Strategic Approach: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment**

#### **Decision Rules**
1. **Initial Rounds (First Round):** Cooperate unconditionally to foster a cooperative environment.
2. **Middle Rounds:** 
   - Monitor the last `m` rounds (e.g., 3) for cooperation rates.
   - If the stock is above a safe threshold (50% of capacity) and cooperation rate in recent rounds exceeds 60%, Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect to punish defectors or avoid resource depletion.
3. **Late Rounds (Last 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Lower the cooperation threshold to encourage defection, maximizing immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.

#### **Implementation Details**
- **Parameters:**
  - `m = 3` (number of recent rounds considered)
  - `cooperation_threshold = 60%`
  - `safe_stock_level = 50%` of capacity
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
  - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
  - **Late Rounds:** Adjust cooperation threshold to be more lenient towards defection.

---

### **Pseudocode**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to encourage others
    
    m = 3  # Number of recent rounds to consider
    start_index = max(0, round_number - m - 1)
    recent_history = history[start_index:round_number-1]
    
    total_actions = len(recent_history) * n
    cooperators_count = sum(action == 'C' for action in recent_history)
    cooperation_rate = cooperators_count / total_actions if total_actions != 0 else 0
    
    # Check if current stock is above the safe level
    safe_stock = capacity * 0.5
    stock_condition = current_stock > safe_stock
    
    # Determine if late rounds
    late_rounds = (round_number >= total_rounds - 2)
    
    if late_rounds:
        # Lower cooperation threshold in late rounds to encourage defection
        required_coop = 0.8  # Only Cooperate if almost everyone is C
    else:
        required_coop = 0.6  # Normal threshold
    
    if cooperation_rate >= required_coop and stock_condition:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins by Cooperating to set a positive precedent, encouraging others to follow suit.
- **Monitoring Recent Behavior:** By examining the last three rounds, the strategy assesses whether cooperation is prevalent. If so, it continues to Cooperate, maintaining the resource and fostering mutual benefit.
- **Stock Condition Check:** Ensuring the stock remains above half capacity helps maintain optimal growth conditions, preventing sudden depletions.
- **Late Round Adjustment:** As the game nears its end, the strategy becomes more inclined towards defection, focusing on maximizing immediate gains without worrying about long-term consequences.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_249 = '''
To address the problem, we developed a strategic decision-making process for players in a resource management game. The strategy focuses on balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to others' actions and the current state of the common pool.

### Approach
1. **Initial Round**: Start by cooperating to support a healthy stock level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Monitor the cooperation rate from the previous round.
   - Check the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - Cooperate if both conditions are met: majority cooperation in the last round and sufficient stock health; otherwise, defect.
3. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust thresholds based on remaining rounds to encourage cooperation early and allow defection later.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, players_actions_prev, current_stock):
    n = len(players_actions_prev)
    capacity = 100  # Assuming the capacity is normalized for this example
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        C_count = sum(1 for action in players_actions_prev if action == 'C')
        P_C = C_count / n
        
        threshold_coop = 0.5
        threshold_stock = 0.8 * capacity  # 80% of capacity
        
        remaining_rounds = total_rounds - round_number + 1
        weight_decreasing = 1.0 if remaining_rounds > total_rounds / 2 else 0.7
        
        adjusted_threshold_coop = threshold_coop * (weight_decreasing)
        
        if P_C > adjusted_threshold_coop and current_stock > threshold_stock:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round**: The strategy starts with cooperation to encourage others to maintain a healthy stock.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Calculate the previous round's cooperation rate.
  - Check if the current stock is above 80% of capacity and if more than half of the players cooperated.
  - Cooperate if both conditions are met; otherwise, defect.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust the cooperation threshold dynamically based on remaining rounds. This encourages sustained cooperation early on but allows for defecting in later stages to maximize immediate gains before potential resource depletion.

This approach aims to sustain a healthy resource pool while protecting against exploitation by adjusting actions based on others' behavior and resource status.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_250 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy**

The strategy balances initial cooperation with adaptive decision-making based on the common pool's health. It transitions smoothly from cooperation to defection as needed, ensuring sustainability while responding to others' behaviors.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

- **Early Rounds (First 25%):** Cooperate to establish a stable resource base.
- **Late Rounds (Last 10%):** Defect to maximize immediate payoffs with fewer future rounds.
- **Middle Rounds:** Use an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the stock level:
  - If current stock > EMA, cooperate.
  - Else, defect.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to encourage sustainability.
- **Last Few Rounds (~t > 0.85r):** Always Defect to capitalize on remaining resources.
- **Stock at Capacity (S = capacity):** Cooperate to maintain the resource.
- **Low Stock (near Zero):** Defect, as cooperation is futile.

---

### **3. Strategy Implementation**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set initial EMA to the starting stock level.
   - Define α (e.g., 0.5) for EMA responsiveness.

2. **Each Round:**
   - Calculate progress fraction (`t/r`).
     - If early (<25%), Cooperate.
     - If late (>85%), Defect.
     - Else, update EMA and decide based on current stock vs. EMA.

3. **Adjustments:**
   - Start updating EMA from the second round for accuracy.
   - Transition smoothly between phases to avoid abrupt changes.

---

### **4. Example Scenarios**

- **All Cooperate:** Stock remains high; strategy continues Cooperating.
- **All Defect:** Stock drops rapidly, prompting defecting after early rounds.
- **Mixed Strategies:** Adapts based on stock trends, balancing cooperation and defection.

---

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, ema, previous_round_stock):
    fraction = current_round / total_rounds

    if fraction < 0.25:
        return 'C'
    elif fraction > 0.85:
        return 'D'
    else:
        alpha = 0.5
        if current_round == 1:
            ema = current_stock
        else:
            ema = alpha * previous_round_stock + (1 - alpha) * ema

        if current_stock > ema:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Usage across rounds
ema = None
previous_stock = None
for t in range(1, total_rounds+1):
    action = decide_action(t, total_rounds, state.stock, ema, previous_stock)
    # Update EMA and previous stock for next iteration
    if t == 1:
        ema = state.stock
    else:
        ema = alpha * previous_stock + (1 - alpha) * ema
    previous_stock = state.stock
```

---

**Conclusion:** This strategy adaptively manages cooperation and defection, ensuring long-term sustainability while responding to short-term pressures.

description_COLLECTIVE_251 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is a dynamic approach that balances individual payoff maximization with maintaining sustainable resource levels. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** If the current stock is above 80% of capacity or if the proportion of Cooperators in recent rounds exceeds 75%, players should Cooperate.
   - **Defect (D):** If the stock is below 40% of capacity, players should Defect. Additionally, if fewer than 25% of players Cooperated recently, players might consider Defecting.

2. **Adaptive Threshold:**
   - Between 40% and 80% stock level, players adapt based on recent behavior:
     - If ≥75% of others Cooperated in the last few rounds, Cooperate.
     - If <25% Cooperated, Defect.
     - Otherwise, follow a weighted average decision.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Default to Cooperate since stock is at maximum (100%).
   - **Uncertain Last Round:** Treat each round as potentially the last but prioritize long-term sustainability.

### Implementation Steps:
- **Initial Action:** Start with Cooperate in the first round.
- **Monitor Stock and Behavior:** Track stock levels and observe others' actions to inform decisions.
- **Adapt Decisions Dynamically:** Adjust based on current stock percentage relative to capacity and recent cooperation trends.

This strategy aims to sustain resource levels while allowing players to maximize their payoffs, adapting to changing behaviors without relying on explicit coordination. It's designed to handle a wide range of opponent strategies and maintain robust performance across different game parameters.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_252 = '''
To determine whether to cooperate or defect in each round, we employ a structured strategy based on the observed stock levels and their trends:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Threshold Definitions:**
   - **Upper Threshold (UT):** 70% of capacity.
   - **Lower Threshold (LT):** 50% of capacity.
   - **Minimal Threshold (MT):** 10% of capacity.

2. **Decision Process for Each Round:**
   a. **Check Current Stock (S):**
      - If **S ≤ MT:** Cooperate to attempt recovery, despite limited potential.
      - If **S > UT:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, trusting growth will sustain the stock.
      - If **S < LT:** Cooperate to help maintain or increase the stock.
   b. **For Stock Between LT and UT:**
      - Compare current stock with the previous round's stock (S_prev).
      - If **S ≥ S_prev:** Defect, as the stock is stable or increasing.
      - If **S < S_prev:** Cooperate, as the stock is decreasing.

### Rationale:
- **Upper Threshold (UT):** Allows defecting when the stock is sufficiently high to sustain consumption and growth.
- **Lower Threshold (LT):** Promotes cooperation when the stock is low to prevent further decline.
- **Minimal Threshold (MT):** Ensures cooperation when the stock is critically low, aiming for recovery.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting decisions based on current conditions and trends.

### Final Answer:
$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the stock is below 50% or decreasing; defect otherwise.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_253 = '''
The proposed collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting decisions based on the current stock level and historical trends. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Move**: Cooperate in the first round to set a baseline of cooperation and encourage others to contribute to sustainable resource use.
2. **Adaptive Play**:
   - **High Stock Levels (Above 75% Capacity)**: Defect to maximize immediate gains, leveraging the buffer provided by a high stock level.
   - **Moderate Stock Levels (Between 25-75% Capacity)**: Cooperate to maintain or rebuild the stock, ensuring sustainability for future rounds.
   - **Low Stock Levels (Below 25% Capacity)**:
     - In early-to-mid rounds, continue Cooperating to attempt recovery of the stock.
     - In later rounds (especially nearing the end), switch to Defecting to salvage remaining resources before potential depletion.

3. **Trend Analysis**: Monitor the stock level over recent rounds. If the stock consistently decreases despite cooperation, increase defection to prevent further decline. Conversely, if defecting leads to stock growth, continue defecting cautiously.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Cooperate (C).
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If `stock > 0.75 * capacity`: Defect (D).
  - If `0.25 * capacity < stock ≤ 0.75 * capacity`: Cooperate (C).
  - If `stock ≤ 0.25 * capacity`:
    - For early-to-mid rounds: Cooperate to encourage recovery.
    - For late rounds: Defect if nearing the end to salvage resources.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, total_rounds):
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity

    # First round strategy
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Last few rounds: defect to salvage resources
    if round_number > (total_rounds - 3):
        return 'D'

    # High stock level: defect
    if stock_level >= high_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    # Moderate stock level: cooperate
    elif low_threshold < stock_level <= high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    
    # Low stock level: check remaining rounds and trend
    else:
        # Check trend over last few rounds
        recent_stock = get_recent_stock_levels(5)
        if is_trend_decreasing(recent_stock):
            return 'D'  # Defect more to salvage
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to rebuild

def is_trend_decreasing(stock_history):
    # Calculate if stock has been decreasing over the history
    for i in range(len(stock_history)-1):
        if stock_history[i] <= stock_history[i+1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round**: Default to Cooperate to promote sustainability.
- **Last Few Rounds (last 3 rounds)**: Switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains as there's no future punishment.
- **Stock Near Capacity**: Defect to take advantage of the buffer while allowing for recovery.
- **Stock Near Depletion**: Monitor trends; if stock is decreasing despite cooperation, switch to defecting to salvage remaining resources.

This strategy adaptively balances between cooperation and defection based on current and historical stock levels, aiming to sustain resource levels while maximizing individual payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_254 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to opponents' behavior and stock dynamics. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Move (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale:** Signals willingness to sustain the resource, encouraging others to cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock and Opponent Behavior:**
     - Track current stock level and recent actions of opponents.
     - If most opponents are Cooperating and the stock is stable or increasing, continue Cooperating.
     - If a significant number defect, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion but avoid crashing the system.

3. **Decision Thresholds:**
   - Cooperate if:
     - Stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
     - At least half of opponents have Cooperated in recent rounds.
   - Defect if:
     - Stock is low and many opponents are defecting.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Consider cooperating to maintain some resource level, but be prepared to defect if others do to maximize immediate payoff without causing crash.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If stock is nearly depleted, cooperate only if recovery is feasible; otherwise, defect cautiously.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```pseudocode
function decide_action(round_number, stock_level, opponent_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return C
    else:
        recent_cooperations = count opponents who Cooperated in last few rounds
        total_players = n
        cooperation_rate = recent_cooperations / total_players
        
        if cooperation_rate > threshold (e.g., 0.5) and stock_level > safe_threshold (e.g., capacity * 0.5):
            return C
        else:
            # Check if defecting will prevent crash or optimize payoff
            if stock_level < critical_low:
                # Consider defecting but only moderately to avoid total crash
                return D
            else:
                # Evaluate potential for future cooperation based on current actions
                if many opponents are defecting, switch to D to signal reciprocation
                else:
                    return C

function handle_last_round():
    # Tend towards C to encourage others; if likely everyone defects, still choose C
    # or use a strategy that deters last-round defection
    pass
```

### Final Considerations:

- **Logistic Growth:** Maintain stock in a mid-range for sustained payoffs.
- **Reciprocity and Reputation:** Cooperate when others do to foster mutual benefit; defect if necessary to deter exploitation.

This strategy aims to maximize long-term payoff by promoting cooperation while adaptively responding to defection, ensuring resource sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_255 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively choosing between cooperation (C) and defection (D). It considers current stock levels, historical actions of other players, and the game's progression. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Initial Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning**: Encourage mutual cooperation by setting a positive precedent.

2. **High Stock Levels (S > 70% of capacity)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate regardless of past actions.
   - **Reasoning**: Maintaining high stock ensures sustainability and avoids resource depletion.

3. **Medium Stock Levels (30% < S ≤ 70%)**:
   - **Decision Rule**: 
     - If more than 60% of players Cooperated in the last few rounds, Cooperate.
     - Otherwise, Defect.
   - **Reasoning**: This balances individual gain with collective sustainability. Cooperating when others do so maintains resource levels; defecting when others do minimizes being exploited.

4. **Low Stock Levels (S ≤ 30%)**:
   - **Action**: Always Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning**: Allows the stock to regrow, preventing further depletion and potential collapse.

5. **Endgame Consideration (Last Few Rounds)**:
   - **Decision Rule**:
     - If stock is high and others are Cooperating, continue Cooperating.
     - Otherwise, switch to Defecting more aggressively to maximize immediate payoffs.
   - **Reasoning**: In the final rounds, defecting can be beneficial as future penalties are minimized.

### Edge Cases and Adaptation

- **Sudden Stock Drops**: If the stock plummets due to many Defectors, respond by Cooperating in subsequent rounds to aid recovery.
- **Memory Factor**: Consider a moving average or weighted history of past actions to prevent oscillations between cooperation and defection.

### Example Application

- **All Cooperate**: Sustains full stock, moderate payoffs, encouraging future cooperation.
- **All Defect**: Immediate high payoffs but leads to resource collapse in subsequent rounds.
- **Mixed Strategies (2 C, 2 D)**: Stock drops to low levels. Next round, if most players Cooperated last time, continue Cooperating; else, Defect.

This strategy adaptively balances individual and collective interests, ensuring sustainability while addressing potential exploitation by others.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_256 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances immediate payoffs with resource preservation. The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the current stock level and recent trends, ensuring sustainability while maximizing gains.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Rounds (High Stock):**
   - Defect when the stock is above 75% of capacity to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Middle Rounds (Moderate Stock):**
   - Monitor stock trends:
     - If the stock remains stable or increases, continue defecting.
     - If the stock decreases significantly over recent rounds, switch to cooperating to prevent further depletion.

3. **Later Rounds (Low Stock or Near End):**
   - Cooperate if the stock is below 25% of capacity to preserve and replenish resources.
   - In the last few rounds (last 2-3), defect cautiously only if the stock is still high, otherwise cooperate to ensure minimal payoffs.

### Pseudocode:

```python
for each round in 1..r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    remaining_rounds = r - round + 1

    # Determine action based on current stock level and recent trends
    if current_stock > (0.75 * capacity):
        action = 'D'
    elif current_stock < (0.25 * capacity):
        action = 'C'
    else:
        # Check past three rounds for trend
        recent_trend = calculate_average_change_in_stock(last_3_rounds)
        if recent_trend < 0:  # Stock decreasing
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'

    # Adjust for final rounds to balance between payoff and preservation
    if remaining_rounds <= 3:
        if current_stock > (0.5 * capacity):
            action = 'D'  # Caution: defect but avoid excessive depletion
        else:
            action = 'C'

    choose action
```

### Explanation:

- **Adaptive Thresholds:** The strategy uses thresholds (75%, 25%) to decide between defecting and cooperating, adjusting based on the stock's trajectory.
- **Trend Analysis:** By examining recent stock changes, players can infer collective behavior and adapt accordingly without relying on specific opponent strategies.
- **Endgame Caution:** In final rounds, cautious defecting is employed if possible, ensuring some resource remains for minimal payoffs while preventing collapse.

This strategy ensures a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability, making it robust against various player behaviors and promoting collective resource preservation.

The strategy aims to balance immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by dynamically adapting decisions based on the current stock level and historical actions of other players. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Decision Rules

1. **High Stock (Above 80% Capacity):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Rationale:** The resource is abundant, allowing higher consumption without risking depletion.

2. **Moderate Stock (40%-80% Capacity):**
   a. **Assess Past Cooperators:** Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in previous rounds.
   b. **Majority Cooperation:** If more than 50% Cooperated last round, **Cooperate** to encourage sustainability.
   c. **Otherwise:** Defect cautiously to avoid significant depletion.

3. **Low Stock (Below 40% Capacity):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Allow regrowth and prevent a "tragedy of the commons" by supporting stock recovery.

### Edge Cases

- **First Round:**
  - **Action:** Cooperate
  - **Rationale:** Establish a sustainable base for future rounds.

- **Last 10% of Rounds:**
  - **Consideration:** May switch to defecting more as future impact is limited, but monitor stock levels.

- **Stock at Capacity:**
  - **Action:** Defect
  - **Rationale:** The resource can sustain maximum consumption with growth restoring it.

- **Stock Near Zero:**
  - **Action:** Cooperate
  - **Rationale:** Prevent further depletion and encourage regrowth.

### Adjustments

- **Monitor Outcomes:** After each round, observe actions and outcomes to adjust thresholds or behavior.
- **Depletion Response:** If defecting causes significant stock depletion, increase cooperation to prevent a crash.

### Summary

The strategy dynamically adapts by Cooperating when the stock is low to encourage regrowth, Defecting when the stock is high to maximize immediate payoff, and balancing actions based on past player behaviors in moderate conditions. This approach seeks to optimize both short-term gains and long-term resource sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_258 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a common resource setting, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating to maintain the resource level without significant depletion.
2. **Adaptive Defection:** If the total consumption in previous rounds is within sustainable limits (≤50% of capacity), defect to gain more from the resource.
3. **Preservation When Threatened:** Cooperate when the resource is scarce or over-exploited, preventing further depletion.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Reasoning: Beginning with cooperation helps maintain the resource level and avoids immediate depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **Evaluate Previous Consumption:**
      - Calculate the total consumption from the previous round relative to the resource's capacity.
   
   b. **Decision Based on Consumption:**
      - If total consumption ≤50% of capacity:
        - **Action:** Defect.
          - Reasoning: The resource is being preserved adequately, allowing you to exploit it for higher gains.
      - Else (total consumption >50%):
        - **Action:** Cooperate.
          - Reasoning: Over-exploitation is occurring; preserving the resource prevents collapse.

3. **Resource Scarcity Check:**
   - If the current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity):
     - **Action:** Cooperate.
       - Reasoning: Preserve what's left to avoid irreversible depletion.

### Formulaic Representation:
- Let \( S_t \) be the stock at time \( t \), and \( C_{t} \) the total consumption in round \( t \).
- Threshold for cooperation based on previous consumption: \( \frac{C_{t}}{\text{Capacity}} \leq 0.5 \).
- Critical low stock threshold: \( S_t < 0.3 \times \text{Capacity} \).

**Decision Rule:**
\[
\text{If } t = 1: \quad \text{Cooperate}
\]
\[
\text{Else if } \frac{C_{t-1}}{\text{Capacity}} \leq 0.5: \quad \text{Defect}
\]
\[
\text{Else if } S_t < 0.3 \times \text{Capacity}: \quad \text{Cooperate}
\]
\[
\text{Else:} \quad \text{Cooperate}
\]

### Final Answer:
A balanced approach that prioritizes long-term sustainability while allowing exploitation when safe is achieved through the strategy outlined above. This ensures resource preservation without foregoing potential gains when conditions permit.

**Final Strategy:**
- Start by cooperating.
- Defect if previous consumption was sustainable (≤50% of capacity).
- Cooperate if over-exploitation or low stock levels are detected to prevent collapse.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially, defect when sustainably consumed, else cooperate}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_259 = '''
**Final Strategy: Sustainable Cooperation with Adaptive Defection**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the target stock level \( T \) as half of the capacity (\( \text{capacity}/2 \)).
   - Establish a moving average (e.g., over the last 3 rounds) to monitor trends in stock levels.

2. **Decision Rule per Round**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     - If the current stock \( S \geq T \) and shows a stable or increasing trend, Cooperate.
     - If \( S < T \) or there's a decreasing trend, Defect.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **Last 10% of Rounds**: Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **High Stock Levels**: Continue Cooperating even above \( T \) if near capacity to prevent overflow.

4. **Adaptation Mechanism**:
   - Adjust \( T \) dynamically based on stock trends and past outcomes, increasing it when sustainability is achieved and decreasing during downturns.

5. **Collective Alignment**:
   - Focus on maintaining a sustainable resource level through cooperation, switching to defection only when necessary to prevent collapse.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to observed changes in the stock level, ensuring robust performance against diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_260 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability by adapting based on current stock levels and past actions. It encourages cooperation to prevent depletion and defects when safe.

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Reasoning:** Build trust and maintain stock levels, encouraging others to follow suit for mutual benefit.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels:**
   - Track current stock after each round.
   - If stock drops below a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), prioritize cooperation in subsequent rounds to prevent further depletion and encourage regrowth.

3. **Analyze Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Observe previous actions to infer strategies:
     - If most defect, switch to cooperation to mitigate impact.
     - If most cooperate, consider defecting for higher payoff but avoid causing a crash.

4. **React to Stock Changes:**
   - **Stock Above Safe Level (e.g., 80% capacity):** Defect cautiously, as resource can withstand more consumption without risking future depletion.
   - **Stock Below Threshold (e.g., 60% capacity):** Cooperate to maintain or regrow the resource.

5. **Last Round Handling:**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Reasoning:** No future rounds for punishment, so defecting maximizes immediate payoff despite potential crash in this round.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Stock at Capacity:** Always cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - **Stock Near Zero:** Cooperate to allow growth before considering defection again.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = get_capacity()
    
    # Initial rounds: default to cooperation
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check stock level thresholds
    safe_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    
    if stock < low_threshold:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to preserve resource
    
    if stock > safe_threshold:
        # Consider defecting if others are cooperating
        recent_coops = sum(1 for r in history[-5:] for action in r.values() if action == 'C')
        if recent_coops / (n * 5) >= 0.7:  # If most recent actions were cooperate
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to avoid crash
    
    # Analyze opponents' past behavior
    recent_rounds = history[-5:]
    total_coops = sum(1 for r in recent_rounds for action in r.values() if action == 'C')
    
    if total_coops / (n * 5) >= 0.6:  # Most are cooperating
        return 'D'  # Exploit by defecting
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent further depletion
    
    # If near last round, defect
    if round_number == r - 1:
        return 'D'
    
    # Default behavior based on stock dynamics
    return 'C' if stock < (capacity / 2) else 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy begins with cooperation to build a sustainable foundation.
- It monitors stock levels, switching to cooperation when the resource is low and considering defection when it's high but safe.
- By analyzing past actions, it adapts to opponents' strategies, encouraging mutual cooperation or exploiting when beneficial.
- In the final round, defecting maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, fostering a cooperative environment while allowing strategic defection when advantageous.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_261 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapt to changing conditions, and encourage collective cooperation. Here's a structured summary of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Early Rounds (Cooperation Phase)**
   - **Action**: Cooperate to build or maintain the stock level.
   - **Rationale**: Early rounds set the foundation for long-term sustainability. Cooperation helps prevent rapid depletion and allows the stock to grow.

2. **Middle Rounds (Adaptive Phase)**
   - **Monitor Stock Trends**: Assess whether the stock is increasing, stable, or decreasing.
     - If **increasing or stable**, continue cooperating to sustain positive trends.
     - If **decreasing significantly**, increase cooperation efforts to prevent further depletion.
   - **Player Behavior Analysis**: Observe other players' actions. If a majority are defecting, consider adjusting strategies in subsequent rounds.

3. **Later Rounds (Near End)**
   - **Temptation to Defect**: Given the limited future impact, consider defecting for higher immediate payoffs.
   - **Stock Condition Check**: If the stock is high and others are cooperating, continue cooperation to sustain payoffs even in later rounds.

4. **Dynamic Thresholds**
   - Use thresholds based on the current stock relative to capacity:
     - **Low Stock (Cooperate)**: When stock is below a certain threshold, cooperate to prevent depletion.
     - **High Stock (Defect)**: When stock is above another threshold, defect for higher immediate gains.

5. **Adaptive Elements**
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on player behavior and stock trends:
     - Lower defection threshold if many players are defecting.
     - Maintain or increase cooperation if others are cooperating to sustain the resource.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to set a sustainable base and encourage others to follow suit.
   - **Last Round**: Consider defecting unless the stock is very low, balancing immediate gains against potential future harm (though in the last round, there's no future beyond it).

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, current_round, n, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Determine recent cooperation rate among other players
    recent_coop = sum(1 for action in history[-last_k_rounds] if action == 'C') / (n - 1)
    
    # Calculate stock-related thresholds
    threshold_low = capacity * 0.3  # Example low threshold
    threshold_high = capacity * 0.7  # Example high threshold
    
    # Check stock trends and current level
    if stock < threshold_low or is_stock_decreasing(stock, history):
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to prevent further depletion
    elif stock > threshold_high:
        return 'D'  # Defect for higher immediate gain
    
    # Consider recent cooperation rate
    if recent_coop > 0.7:  # Most other players are cooperating
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
    
    # Handle the last round separately
    if current_round == r:
        minimal_threshold = capacity * 0.2  # Example threshold for minimal cooperation
        if stock < minimal_threshold:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate to avoid severe depletion
        else:
            return 'D'  # Defect in the final round for higher payoff

def is_stock_decreasing(stock, history):
    # Implementation logic to check if stock is decreasing over time
    pass
```

### Summary

This strategy emphasizes cooperation when necessary to maintain resource sustainability and adapts to defect when conditions allow for higher individual gains without causing significant long-term harm. It dynamically adjusts based on player behavior and stock levels, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies while promoting collective cooperation for mutual benefit.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_262 = '''
To address the problem, we analyze whether an individual player should cooperate or defect based on the current stock level \( S \) and the number of players \( n \). The goal is to determine a strategy that maximizes sustainability while accounting for potential defections.

1. **Cooperation Analysis**:
   - When all players cooperate, each consumes \( \frac{S}{2n} \), leading to total consumption \( \frac{S}{2} \).
   - Remaining stock after cooperation: \( S' = S - \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{2} \).
   - Growth from remaining stock: \( G = 2 \times \frac{S}{2} \times \left(1 - \frac{\frac{S}{2}}{S}\right) = \frac{S}{2} \).
   - Next round's stock: \( S'' = \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} = S \). This maintains the stock at capacity.

2. **Defection Analysis**:
   - If a player defects, they consume \( \frac{S}{n} \), increasing total consumption beyond sustainable levels.
   - Example with one defector: Total consumption becomes \( \frac{3S}{4} \) (for \( n=4 \)), leading to lower growth and potential stock depletion over time.

3. **Threshold Strategy**:
   - Setting a threshold at \( T = 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \) ensures sustainability when cooperation is maintained.
   - If the stock drops below \( T \), switching to defection can prevent collapse but risks further depletion if not managed.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Cooperating sustains the system if all players do so.
   - Defecting can lead to collapse but may be necessary once sustainability is threatened.

Based on this, the optimal strategy for an individual player is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when } S \geq 0.5 \times \text{capacity; otherwise, defect}}

**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with adaptive punishment based on previous actions and stock levels. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Preserves stock and sets a cooperative tone for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Observation:** Analyze the previous round's actions.
     - **If Most Cooperated:** Continue cooperating to sustain high payoffs and stock.
     - **If Significant Defection (≥25%):** Enter Punishment Phase next round.

3. **Stock Threshold Check:**
   - **Above 80% Capacity:** Maintain cooperation to allow growth and sustainability.
   - **Below 80% Capacity:** Consider defecting to prevent further depletion leading to collapse.

4. **Punishment Phase:**
   - **Action:** Defect in the next round regardless of other factors.
   - **Exit Condition:** If stock recovers above 80% and cooperation resumes, revert to normal strategy.

5. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```python
current_round = 1

while current_round <= r:
    if current_round == 1:
        action = "C"
    else:
        # Check previous round's actions and stock level
        if previous_defectors < n * 0.25:
            # Most cooperated
            if stock >= 0.8 * capacity:
                action = "C"
            else:
                action = "D"  # Consider defecting due to low stock
        else:
            # Enter Punishment Phase
            action = "D"
    # Perform the action and update state
    perform_action(action)
    current_round += 1

def perform_action(action):
    if action == "C":
        consume(stock / (2 * n))
    else:
        consume(stock / n)

def check_punishment_phase():
    return entered_punishment_phase
```

This strategy encourages cooperation while adaptively punishing defection, ensuring sustainable outcomes and robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_264 = '''
The strategy outlined by the user aims to maintain a balance between sustainable resource use and exploitation. Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Cooperate When Stock is High (Above 50% of Capacity):**
   - By Cooperating, players ensure that the resource is sustainably used. The growth mechanism compensates for consumption, maintaining or slightly increasing the stock level without depleting it.

2. **Defect in Mid-Range Stock Levels (Between 20% and 50%):**
   - Defecting here aims to prevent excessive growth of the stock, which could lead to overuse if not controlled. It also serves as a mechanism to encourage others to Cooperate when the stock is low.

3. **Cooperate When Stock is Low (Below 20%):**
   - Cooperating at low levels helps rebuild the resource, preventing it from collapsing entirely. Growth can occur once some stock remains, encouraging a recovery cycle.

**Potential Issues with the Strategy:**

- If all players follow this strategy, there's a risk of the resource collapsing to zero when Defecting in mid-range leads to complete depletion.
- Recovery from low levels may be challenging as growth depends on remaining stock, which might not be sufficient if S drops too low.

**Conclusion:**
While the strategy intends to balance resource use and sustainability, its effectiveness depends on player behavior and the specific dynamics of consumption and growth. If all players Defect at mid-range levels simultaneously, it can lead to a collapse, highlighting the need for careful coordination or alternative strategies to ensure long-term sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_265 = '''
To address the problem of designing a robust and adaptive strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to consider both cooperative and defective behaviors while ensuring sustainability and maximizing cumulative payoffs. The strategy should encourage cooperation when feasible and respond appropriately to defection.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to set a positive precedent and encourage others to follow suit.
2. **Monitor and Adjust:** In subsequent rounds, adjust behavior based on the cooperation rate of other players from the previous round and the current stock level.
3. **Dynamic Thresholds:** Use dynamic thresholds for required cooperation rates, which vary depending on the current stock level to maintain sustainability.
4. **Handle Endgame Cautiously:** Approach the final rounds with caution to prevent sudden over-consumption while still aiming for high cumulative payoffs.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale:** Initiate cooperation to encourage others and establish a positive trend.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   a. **Calculate Previous Cooperation Rate:**
      - Determine the proportion of players who cooperated in the immediately preceding round.
   
   b. **Adjust Threshold Based on Stock Level:**
      - If stock is above 70% of capacity, set a lower cooperation threshold (e.g., >50%).
      - If stock is between 30%-70%, raise the threshold to encourage more cooperation (e.g., >60%).
      - If stock is below 30%, increase the threshold further (e.g., >70%) to promote sustainability.

   c. **Decision:**
      - Cooperate if the previous round's cooperation rate meets or exceeds the adjusted threshold.
      - Defect otherwise, signaling disapproval of low cooperation and encouraging future cooperation.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   a. **Conservative Approach:**
      - If stock is high and majority cooperation has been observed in previous rounds, Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
      - Consider defecting only if there's strong evidence others will do so, balancing immediate gain against potential over-consumption.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
for each round from 1 to r:
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        prev_coop_rate = calculate_previous_cooperation_rate()
        current_stock = get_current_stock_level()
        
        # Determine threshold based on stock level
        if current_stock > 0.7 * capacity:
            required_threshold = 0.5  # 50%
        elif 0.3 * capacity < current_stock <= 0.7 * capacity:
            required_threshold = 0.6  # 60%
        else:
            required_threshold = 0.7  # 70%
        
        if prev_coop_rate >= required_threshold:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'
    
    perform_action(action)
```

### Final Answer:

The strategy balances initial cooperation, dynamic threshold adjustments based on stock levels and past behavior, and cautious handling of the final round to maximize cumulative payoffs while promoting sustainability. 

**Final Strategy:**

- **Start Cooperating:** Begin with cooperation in the first round.
- **Dynamic Cooperation Thresholds:** Adjust required cooperation rates based on current stock levels, requiring higher cooperation when the stock is low.
- **Endgame Caution:** Maintain cooperative behavior in the last rounds unless a significant number of players have defected, prioritizing sustainable payoffs.

This approach ensures that the strategy adapts to varying conditions, encouraging collective cooperation while addressing potential defection and endgame scenarios. 

\boxed{
\text{Cooperate initially, adjust thresholds dynamically based on stock levels and past cooperation, and handle final rounds cautiously.}
}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_266 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment and Recovery**

1. **Cooperative Baseline**: 
   - Begin each round by Cooperating (C) unless triggered otherwise.

2. **Punishment Mechanism**: 
   - If any player Defects (D) in the last `grace_period` rounds, switch to D for the next `punishment_rounds`. Reset after this period if the stock is above a critical threshold.

3. **Grace Period**: 
   - After detecting a Defector, allow `grace_period` rounds before considering punishment again.

4. **Stock Threshold**: 
   - If the current stock drops below `capacity * 0.75`, switch to D temporarily to prevent further depletion and allow recovery.

5. **Adaptive Learning**: 
   - Adjust thresholds (`punishment_rounds`, `grace_period`) based on historical performance to optimize sustainability.
   - In later rounds, especially nearing the end, consider cooperation more cautiously to prevent last-round defection incentives.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**: 
   - First Round: Cooperate.
   - Last Few Rounds: Adjust strategy to prevent exploitation; may involve a slight bias towards cooperation if historical data supports it.

**Pseudocode Overview**

```
Initialize:
    cooperate = True
    punishment_rounds = 3
    grace_period = 5
    critical_threshold = capacity * 0.75

For each round from 1 to r:
    If round == 1:
        action = C
    Else:
        Check if any player Defected in the last grace_period rounds:
            If yes:
                action = D
                increment punishment counter
                If punishment_counter >= punishment_rounds:
                    reset punishment_counter and cooperate
            Else:
                If stock < critical_threshold:
                    action = D
                Else:
                    action = C

    After choosing action, update history with current action and stock level.

Adjust thresholds based on historical performance after each round.
```

**Explanation:**

- **Cooperation by Default**: Players start by Cooperating to maintain the common pool sustainably.
- **Punishment for Defectors**: Temporary defection punishes those who overconsume, encouraging future cooperation.
- **Grace Period**: Allows reset of punishment cycles, preventing endless retaliation and fostering forgiveness.
- **Stock Thresholds**: Maintain resource sustainability by defecting temporarily when stock is low to allow recovery.
- **Adaptation**: Strategies evolve based on historical outcomes, enhancing long-term performance.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, promoting cooperation while deterring excessive exploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_267 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Triggers**

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to establish a positive precedent and maintain a healthy stock level for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Cooperate** if the current stock is above 80% of capacity or if most players have cooperated in previous rounds.
   - **Defect** if the stock is below 80% or if there has been significant defection by others recently.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**: If applicable, defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

4. **Stock Thresholds**: Use 80% of capacity as a key threshold for cooperation versus defection decisions.

5. **Defection Triggers**:
   - Stock below 80%.
   - Significant defection by others in recent rounds (e.g., more than half of players defected in the last round).

6. **Adaptation**: After each round, reassess stock levels and player behavior to adjust strategy dynamically.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - First Round: Cooperate.
   - Last Round: Defect if known, else cooperate as usual.
   - High Stock: Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - Low Stock: Consider defecting cautiously to prevent further depletion.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and past behaviors of other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_268 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing cooperation for long-term gains with defection for immediate benefits in a finite number of rounds, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Outline:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a sustainable resource level and maximize future payoffs.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (until the second-to-last round):**
   - Observe the stock level and recent cooperation trends.
   - If the stock has been increasing or stable over the past k rounds AND a high proportion of other players have been Cooperating, continue to Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate gain and potentially encourage others to adjust their strategies.
3. **Last Round:** Always Defect to exploit any remaining resource without concern for future consequences.

### Detailed Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate to ensure the stock remains at capacity, allowing for higher payoffs in subsequent rounds.

2. **Dynamic Adaptation Based on Recent Trends:**
   - For each round after the first, calculate two metrics:
     a. **Recent Stock Trend:** Determine whether the stock has been increasing or decreasing over the past k rounds (k is a fixed window size, e.g., 3 rounds).
     b. **Proportion of Cooperators:** Calculate the percentage of times other players have Cooperated in the last k rounds.

   - If both the recent stock trend shows an increase or stability AND the proportion of Cooperators exceeds a predetermined threshold (e.g., 60%), then Cooperate in this round.
   - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate payoff and potentially influence others' strategies in future rounds.

3. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - In the last round, all players defect to take maximum advantage of any remaining resource without concern for future rounds since there are none left.

### Parameters:
- **k (Window Size):** The number of past rounds considered when evaluating trends and cooperation levels (e.g., 3 rounds).
- **Threshold for Cooperation Proportion:** A fixed percentage (e.g., 60%) indicating the minimum proportion of Cooperators needed to continue Cooperating.
- **Stock Stability Threshold:** A fixed level (e.g., 75% of capacity) above which the stock is considered stable enough to warrant continued Cooperation.

### Example Implementation:
1. **Round 1:**
   - Action = Cooperate
2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   a. Calculate recent_stock_trend as (current_stock - stock_k_rounds_ago) / k.
   b. Count the number of Cooperators in the last k rounds and calculate proportion_cooperate.
   c. If recent_stock_trend > 0 and proportion_cooperate > 60%:
      - Action = Cooperate
      Else:
      - Action = Defect
3. **Round r (Last Round):**
   - Action = Defect

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Ensures the resource remains at a sustainable level, allowing for higher payoffs in subsequent rounds.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Encourages cooperation when the resource is stable and others are cooperating, while allowing defection when necessary to prevent resource depletion and maximize individual gains.
- **Final Round Defection:** Exploits any remaining resource without concern for future rounds, aligning with rational self-interest.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically based on observed outcomes and encouraging cooperation when beneficial.

**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reason: Starting with cooperation encourages a sustainable approach and allows the stock to remain stable, ensuring future rounds have enough resource.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - Calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
     - If the proportion is above 60%, all players cooperate this round.
     - If below or equal to 60%, all players defect this round as a form of punishment.
     - Reason: This threshold encourages cooperation and punishes defection, preventing the game from spiraling into all-defection too quickly.

3. **Final Few Rounds (Rounds r-1 and r):**
   - **Adjustment Based on Stock Levels:**
     - If the stock is above 80% of capacity, continue cooperating to allow for regrowth.
     - If the stock is below or equal to 80%, defect in the final rounds to maximize immediate payoffs before the game ends.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - The threshold for cooperation can be adjusted based on the current stock level:
     - Lower thresholds (e.g., 50%) when the stock is low to encourage more cooperation and allow regrowth.
     - Higher thresholds (e.g., 70%) when the stock is high, allowing some defection without risking over-depletion.

5. **Consideration of Growth Dynamics:**
   - Maintain a higher stock level by encouraging cooperation, especially when the stock is near capacity to ensure maximum growth potential.

**Summary:** The strategy begins with cooperation, adjusts based on the previous round's behavior using a dynamic threshold, and handles endgame scenarios by considering stock levels. This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, fostering a cooperative environment while adapting to different opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_270 = '''
The strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term resource preservation through adaptability based on game dynamics and player behavior.

### Strategy Description:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - This helps build a sustainable resource base, benefiting all players.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Trends:**
     - Track the stock level after each round to detect consistent decreases.
   - **Threshold for Switching Strategies:**
     - If the stock consistently drops below 80% of capacity over several rounds, switch to defecting.
     - This indicates high defection rates among other players.

3. **Defecting Phase:**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Continue defecting until near the end of the game or if the stock shows recovery signs (indicating others may have started cooperating again).

4. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect Aggressively
     - Maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds.

5. **Adaptive Reset Mechanism:**
   - If, while defecting, the stock recovers above 90% of capacity over a few rounds, revert to cooperating to sustain resource levels.

### Decision Rules:

- **Cooperate** if:
  - In the initial rounds.
  - Stock levels are stable or increasing after cooperation.
  
- **Defect** if:
  - Stock consistently decreases despite cooperation.
  - In the last 10% of rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to start sustainably.
- **Last Rounds:** Switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs.
- **Stock Near Capacity or Low Levels:**
  - Cooperate when stock is high to maintain it; defect when low if others aren't preserving.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock_history):
    initial_coop_rounds = 3
    final_defect_threshold = 0.9 * total_rounds
    stock_trend = calculate_stock_trend(stock_history)
    
    if current_round <= initial_coop_rounds:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round > final_defect_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if len(stock_history) >= 5 and check_consistent_decrease(stock_history[-5:], threshold=0.8):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def calculate_stock_trend(recent_stocks):
    # Calculate trend over recent rounds
    pass

def check_consistent_decrease(stocks, threshold):
    # Check if stock consistently below threshold
    pass
```

This strategy is adaptive, robust, and aligns with a collective mindset by preserving resources when possible while reacting to exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_271 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy considers both the behavior of other players and the current state of the shared resource.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to establish a sustainable base and observe others' behaviors.
2. **Adaptive Strategy Based on Cooperators Percentage**: In middle rounds, continue cooperating if at least 60% of players cooperated in the previous round and the stock is above 70% of capacity. Otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoffs.
3. **Endgame Handling**: Switch to defecting in the last 5% of rounds to maximize individual payoffs before the game ends.
4. **Dynamic Adjustments**: Track the number of cooperators and stock levels over time to adapt thresholds dynamically.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(player_index, n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history)
    total_rounds = r
    initial_stock = capacity

    if current_round == 0:
        # First round: Cooperate unconditionally
        return 'C'
    
    else:
        previous_actions = history[-1]
        cooperator_count = sum(1 for action in previous_actions.values() if action == 'C')
        percent_coop = (cooperator_count / n) * 100

        current_stock = calculate_current_stock(history, initial_stock)
        
        # Determine strategy based on game phase and conditions
        if current_round < total_rounds * 0.05:
            return 'C'
        elif current_round > total_rounds * 0.95:
            return 'D'
        else:
            if percent_coop >= 60 and current_stock > capacity * 0.7:
                # Continue Cooperating under favorable conditions
                return 'C'
            else:
                # Switch to Defecting otherwise
                return 'D'

def calculate_current_stock(history, initial_capacity):
    stock = initial_capacity
    for round_data in history:
        total_taken = sum(2 if action == 'D' else 1 for action in round_data.values())
        remaining = max(stock - total_taken, 0)
        growth = 2 * remaining * (1 - remaining / initial_capacity) if remaining > 0 else 0
        stock = remaining + growth
    return stock
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins by cooperating to foster sustainability and gather data on opponents' behaviors.
- **Middle Rounds Adaptation**: It adapts based on the previous round's cooperators percentage and current stock level. Cooperating continues if conditions are favorable; otherwise, defecting is chosen.
- **Endgame Handling**: Defecting in the final rounds ensures maximum individual payoff before the game concludes.
- **Dynamic Adjustments**: The strategy dynamically adjusts thresholds based on observed trends to maintain robustness against various opponent behaviors.

This approach effectively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance across different scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_272 = '''
To design an effective strategy for balancing cooperation and defection based on environmental and social factors, we can outline a clear approach:

### Strategy Outline:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to establish a sustainable baseline and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Monitoring Mechanisms**:
   - **Stock Level**: Continuously monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - **Defector Proportion**: Track the proportion of players who defected in previous rounds.

3. **Decision Rules**:
   - If either the stock level falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) or the proportion of defectors exceeds a certain percentage (e.g., 30%), switch to defecting.
   - Maintain cooperation if both conditions are favorable, promoting sustainability and reciprocity.

### Pseudocode Representation:
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, previous_defectors, n_players):
    # Initial round
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Define thresholds
    safe_stock_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    defector_proportion_threshold = 0.30
    
    stock_safe = current_stock >= safe_stock_threshold
    few_defectors = (previous_defectors / n_players) <= defector_proportion_threshold
    
    if stock_safe and few_defectors:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: The first round sets a positive precedent, encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Stock Monitoring**: By maintaining a safe stock level, the strategy ensures long-term sustainability without unduly penalizing cooperation.
- **Defector Tracking**: Observing defector proportions allows players to adapt quickly if too many defect, preventing exploitation and potential collapse.

This approach balances individual gains with collective welfare, adapting dynamically to changing conditions while encouraging cooperative behavior.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_273 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to promote collective cooperation while adaptively responding to defection. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating to maintain a high stock level, fostering sustainability.

2. **Monitor Stock and Behavior**:
   - Track the current stock relative to capacity.
   - Observe past actions of other players to detect patterns of defection.

3. **Threshold-Based Adaptation**:
   - If the stock drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to Defecting to signal disapproval and prevent further depletion.
   - After detecting a significant number of Defectors, enter a Punishment phase where all players (if following this strategy) Defect for a set period.

4. **Punishment Phase**:
   - Continue Defecting for a few rounds post-detection to discourage future defection.
   - Monitor stock recovery; if it starts improving, consider reverting to Cooperation.

5. **Transition and Recovery**:
   - Once the stock recovers above a threshold, switch back to Cooperating to maintain sustainability.
   - Use trends in consumption and stock levels to decide transitions smoothly.

6. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - In the last round(s), adjust strategies considering there are no future rounds; balance immediate payoffs with past cooperation efforts.
   - Near capacity or zero, adapt actions to prevent depletion or over-consumption.

### Decision Rules

- **Cooperate**: If the stock is above 50% of capacity and less than a third of players Defected in the last round.
- **Defect**: If the stock is below 50%, more than a third of players Defected, or it's the last few rounds.

### Pseudocode

```python
for each round:
    if current_round == first_round:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        calculate_stock_level = (current_stock / capacity)
        count_defectors = number_of_D_actions_in_previous_rounds
        percent_defectors = count_defectors / n
        
        if stock_level > 0.5 and percent_defectors < 1/3:
            return Cooperate
        elif stock_level <= 0.5 or percent_defectors >= 1/3:
            if in_punishment_phase:
                return Defect
            else:
                start_punishment_phase = True
                return Defect
    # After punishment phase, revert to Cooperate when conditions improve
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observable information and historical data.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_274 = '''
The optimal strategy for balancing cooperation and defection in this repeated game scenario involves adapting based on the current state of the shared resource (stock level). Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a sustainable resource level.

2. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Track the stock level after each round. Use this information to adjust future actions.

3. **Threshold-Based Adaptation:**
   - **Upper Threshold (90% of Capacity):** If the stock is above 90%, continue cooperating.
   - **Middle Range (50-90% of Capacity):** Defect with a probability that increases as the stock decreases below 90%. The probability can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Defection Probability} = \max\left(0, \frac{90\% - S}{40\%}\right)
     \]
     where \(S\) is the current stock level.
   - **Lower Threshold (50% of Capacity):** If the stock drops below 50%, switch to full cooperation to aid in resource recovery.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - In the last few rounds, shift towards defecting more to maximize immediate payoffs since future consequences are negligible.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a baseline for sustainability and encourages others to contribute.
- **Upper Threshold (90%):** Indicates a healthy resource level where cooperation is beneficial.
- **Middle Range Adaptation:** Encourages defection when overharvesting signs appear, signaling the need for adjustment without risking complete depletion.
- **Lower Threshold (50%):** Triggers full cooperation to prevent resource collapse and allow recovery.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment:** Maximizes personal gain in the final rounds without concern for future impacts.

### Example Application:

For a game with \(n=4\) players and capacity=100:

- If stock is 62.5 (between 50% and 90%), defect with probability \((90 - 62.5)/40 ≈ 0.6875\). This adaptive approach helps manage resource levels dynamically.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and adjusting behavior to prevent overharvesting when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_275 = '''
To address the problem of encouraging cooperation while preventing resource depletion, we can employ a threshold-based strategy that adapts to the current state of resources and the number of remaining rounds. This strategy balances immediate gains with future sustainability.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: For each subsequent round (excluding the last two), cooperate if the current resource level exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., 75% of maximum capacity). This encourages sustainable use when resources are sufficient.
3. **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last two rounds, always defect to maximize immediate gains since there's no future payoff to consider.

This strategy ensures that cooperation is maintained when resources are abundant, preventing over-depletion, while exploiting resources in the final rounds to secure higher individual payoffs.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, remaining_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    k_final_rounds = 2
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif remaining_rounds <= k_final_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The first move is to cooperate, fostering a cooperative environment and encouraging others to follow suit.
- **Threshold Check**: By setting a threshold (75% of capacity), the strategy ensures that cooperation continues only when resources are sufficient. This prevents premature depletion and sustains resource levels for future rounds.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last two rounds, defecting is optimal since there's no need to preserve resources for subsequent rounds, allowing for maximum individual gain.

This approach effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and the number of remaining rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_276 = '''
To address this problem, we need to develop a strategy for an AI agent that decides whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round based on the current state of the resource and the behavior of other agents. The goal is to maximize long-term payoffs while considering the impact of actions on future rounds.

### Approach
The approach involves creating a set of decision rules that guide the AI's actions:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate to establish a cooperative base.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, Cooperate.
   - If the current stock is below 25% of capacity, Defect.
   - For intermediate stock levels (between 25% and 75%), check the number of Cooperators in the previous round. If more than half were Cooperating, continue Cooperating; otherwise, Defect.
3. **Final Rounds**: Adjust thresholds to encourage more Defection as future rounds are limited.

### Solution Code

### Explanation
The strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. By Cooperating when the resource is abundant and others are supporting sustainability, the AI helps maintain a stable resource level. When the resource is low or others are exploiting it by Defecting, the AI adapts by also Defecting to maximize short-term benefits. Adjustments in the final rounds encourage more Defection as future rounds become less impactful, ensuring optimal use of remaining resources.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_277 = '''
To effectively balance between maintaining sustainable payoffs and maximizing immediate gains while considering potential defections by other players, a structured strategy can be employed:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the early rounds to establish a cooperative equilibrium and ensure the resource remains sustainable.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - For each round except the last few, check if the current stock is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 70-80% of capacity).
   - If the stock is above this threshold, continue to Cooperate.
   - If it falls below, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs while allowing the resource to recover in subsequent rounds.

3. **Final Rounds Exploitation**: In the last few rounds (e.g., 10% of total rounds), always Defect to extract maximum possible payoff since there's no future impact beyond these rounds.

This strategy adapts dynamically based on the current stock level, encouraging cooperation when sustainable and defecting strategically to prevent exploitation. It ensures a balance between long-term sustainability and short-term gains, making it robust against varying player behaviors.

**Final Strategy:**

- **Early Rounds (First 90% of Total Rounds)**:
  - If the current stock is above 70-80% of capacity, Cooperate.
  - Otherwise, Defect.

- **Last Few Rounds**:
  - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

This approach optimizes payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability when possible, adjusting dynamically to others' actions.

description_COLLECTIVE_279 = '''
**Strategy Design for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The goal is to create an adaptive, robust strategy that promotes sustainability while responding to other players' actions. The strategy balances cooperation with defection based on observed stock levels and game progress.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Early Rounds (First 3-5):**
   - Cooperate to encourage sustainable harvesting and resource preservation.
   
2. **Late Rounds (Last 2-3):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future rounds for consequences.

3. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity:
     - If the stock is above 80% of capacity, Cooperate.
     - If the stock drops below 60% of capacity, switch to Defecting to salvage remaining resources.

4. **Adaptive Adjustment:**
   - Track past rounds' stock changes. If despite Cooperating, the stock continues to decline significantly, switch to Defecting in future rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to promote sustainability.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize payoff.
- **High Stock Levels (>80% capacity):** Continue Cooperating as it's sustainable.
- **Low Stock Levels (<60% capacity):** Switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.

### Strategy Implementation:

- **Initialization:**
  - Determine early and late round thresholds (e.g., first 3-5 rounds, last 2-3 rounds).
  - Set stock thresholds for cooperation (80%) and defect trigger (60%).

- **Per Round Execution:**
  1. Check the current round number.
     - Early rounds: Cooperate if stock is above 80%.
     - Late rounds: Defect.
  2. For middle rounds:
     - If stock > 80%, Cooperate.
     - If stock < 60%, Defect.
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating unless past trends indicate continued decline.

### Pseudocode:

```python

  - Rationale: Establishes trust and promotes initial sustainability, setting a positive precedent for future rounds.

#### **Subsequent Rounds:**
Players evaluate the following metrics to decide their action:

1. **Stock Level Relative to Capacity (S):**
   - If `S > threshold_stock`, cooperate.
   - Else, defect.

2. **Historical Defection Rate (HDR):**
   - Calculate HDR as the proportion of defections in previous rounds.
   - If HDR exceeds a defined threshold, defect to deter further defection and protect resource levels.

3. **Defection Penalty (DP):**
   - Apply a penalty if the number of defectors in the last round is above a certain percentage of players.

#### **Final Round:**
- **Action:** Cooperate unless the stock level is critically low, in which case defect to avoid contributing to further depletion.
  - Rationale: Prevents a "tragedy of the commons" in the final round by encouraging cooperation when possible.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling**

#### **First Round (Round 1):**
- Players always cooperate to ensure initial resource sustainability and set a cooperative tone.

#### **Last Round (Round r):**
- Cooperate unless the stock is below a critical threshold, where defecting prevents contributing to resource exhaustion.

#### **Critical Stock Threshold:**
- If `S < critical_threshold`, players defect to avoid exacerbating resource depletion.

### **3. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, historical_defections):
    threshold_stock = 0.8 * capacity  # Example threshold
    defection_penalty = calculate_defection_penalty(historical_defections)
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == r:
        if current_stock < critical_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    else:
        if (current_stock > threshold_stock) and (defection_penalty < defection_threshold):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

---

### **4. Explanation**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Promotes trust and sustainability, encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Ensures players adapt based on the current state of resources, preventing depletion.
- **Defection Penalty:** Deters defection by adjusting actions in response to historical behavior, encouraging mutual cooperation.
- **Adaptability:** The strategy dynamically adjusts based on game dynamics, promoting long-term sustainability and individual payoff maximization.

By balancing immediate gains with long-term resource health, this strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment while being robust against defectors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_281 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a dynamic strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on the current state of the resource and historical player behavior. The strategy is designed to adapt to various scenarios, ensuring sustainability while maximizing payoffs.

### Strategy Design

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **Cooperate (C):**
  - When the stock level is above a certain threshold (adjusted based on remaining rounds).
  - When the majority of recent actions indicate cooperation.
  
- **Defect (D):**
  - When the stock is below the threshold, indicating potential overuse.
  - When detecting an increase in defecting behavior among other players.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage collective sustainability.
- **Last Rounds:** Adjust thresholds to prioritize immediate gains as future rounds diminish.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, current_round, capacity, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players
    remaining = total_rounds - current_round
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity if remaining > 0.2 * total_rounds else 0.5 * capacity
    
    if stock >= threshold:
        recent_coop = sum(1 for h in history[-10:] if h == 'C') / 10 if len(history) >= 10 else 1
        return 'C' if recent_coop > 0.7 else 'D'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Edge Cases Handling
if current_round == 1:
    return 'C' if stock >= 0.8 * capacity else 'D'
elif remaining <= 0:
    return 'D'
else:
    return decide_action(stock, history, current_round, capacity, total_rounds)
```

### Conclusion

This strategy dynamically adjusts cooperation and defection based on resource levels and historical behavior, promoting sustainability while preventing exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_282 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a dynamic strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on the current stock level and historical behavior of other players. The strategy is designed to sustain the resource while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a sustainable resource base.
2. **Dynamic Adjustment**: In subsequent rounds, assess the current stock level relative to capacity and recent defection rates to decide between cooperation or defection.
3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: Use a threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) to determine if cooperation is viable. If the stock falls below this threshold or defection rates rise above a certain level, switch to defecting.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decision(round_number, stock_level, history):
    # Parameters: adjust based on empirical testing
    capacity_threshold = 0.8  # 80% of capacity as sustainability benchmark
    max_defection_rate = 0.3  # Maximum acceptable defection rate

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        recent_stock = get_recent_stock_levels(history, window=5)
        average_stock = mean(recent_stock)
        defections = count_defections(history)
        defection_rate = defections / len(history) if history else 0

        # Check if stock is above threshold and defection rate is low
        if (stock_level > capacity * capacity_threshold and 
            defection_rate < max_defection_rate):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: The first round starts with cooperation to maintain a high stock level, encouraging sustainability.
- **Recent Stock Levels**: By examining the average stock over recent rounds, the strategy assesses whether the resource is being sustainably managed.
- **Defection Rate Monitoring**: Tracking defection rates helps determine if other players are exploiting the resource, prompting a switch to defection to prevent further depletion.

### Edge Cases and Considerations:
- **First Round**: Cooperation ensures the stock remains high, promoting future sustainability.
- **Last Rounds**: Even in later rounds, cooperation is encouraged unless the stock is critically low, preventing a sudden collapse.
- **Stock Trends**: The strategy considers trends over multiple rounds to avoid reacting too quickly to transient changes.

This approach fosters a balance between individual gain and collective resource management, adapting dynamically to maintain sustainability while deterring exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_283 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to maximize total payoff while balancing immediate gains with sustainable resource management. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Rounds (Cooperation Phase):**
   - Cooperate in the first few rounds when the stock is at maximum capacity. This helps sustain higher payoffs by allowing the stock to replenish each round.

2. **Stock Threshold Monitoring:**
   - Set thresholds for stock levels:
     - **Upper Threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity):** Continue cooperation as long as the stock remains above this level.
     - **Lower Threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity):** If the stock drops below this, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains.

3. **Player Behavior Adaptation:**
   - Monitor the behavior of other players. If a significant number start defecting, respond by defecting to avoid exploitation and maximize individual payoff.

4. **Endgame Strategy (Last Few Rounds):**
   - Defect more aggressively in the last few rounds since there's no future payoff to consider after the game ends.

5. **Growth Function Consideration:**
   - Aim to keep the stock around 50% of capacity by adjusting cooperation and defection rates, as this mid-range allows for optimal growth and sustainable payoffs.

**Decision Rules:**

- **Cooperate:** When the stock is above 60% of capacity and most other players are cooperating.
- **Defect:** If the stock drops below 30% or a significant number of other players defect.
- **Aggressive Defection:** In the last few rounds to maximize immediate gains.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    r = total_rounds
    
    # Determine thresholds based on capacity and historical behavior
    upper_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    lower_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among others
    recent_rounds = history[-5:]  # Consider last 5 rounds or fewer if game is shorter
    cooperation_rate = sum(1 for r in recent_rounds 
                          for a in r['actions'].values() 
                          if a == 'C') / (n * len(recent_rounds))
    
    if stock > upper_threshold and cooperation_rate > 0.7:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate if stock is high and others are mostly cooperating
    elif stock < lower_threshold or cooperation_rate < 0.3:
        return 'D'  # Defect if stock is low or many defect
    else:
        # Mid-game: balance based on current stock and others' actions
        if round_number > r - 5:
            return 'D'  # Last few rounds, defect aggressively
        elif stock / capacity < 0.4:
            return 'D'  # Stock is low, switch to defecting
        else:
            return 'C'  # Continue cooperating
            
```

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on the current state of the resource, the behavior of other players, and the stage of the game, aiming to maximize individual payoffs while considering collective sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_284 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Retaliation**

1. **Initial Round Strategy**: 
   - Begin by Cooperating (C) in the first round to foster a sustainable environment and test others' intentions.

2. **Adaptation Based on History**:
   - After each round, assess the number of Defectors (D) and their impact on the stock.
   - Establish thresholds for cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and stock levels.

3. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - If the stock level remains above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold due to excessive Defection, consider adjusting the strategy.

4. **Punishment Mechanism**:
   - If more than 50% of players Defect in two consecutive rounds and the stock is significantly depleted (below 70%), initiate a retaliation phase where defecting becomes more frequent to encourage others to Cooperate.

5. **Endgame Consideration**:
   - In the last few rounds, balance between maximizing immediate payoffs and not overly depleting the stock, which could affect earlier rounds if applicable.

6. **Collective Adaptation**:
   - Adjust strategies based on collective behavior observed over multiple rounds. Shift towards Cooperating if others sustain it; defect more if Defection persists.

**Pseudocode Outline**:

```
for each player i from 1 to n:
    for each round t from 1 to r:
        if t == 1:
            action = C
        else:
            count_D = number of D's in previous rounds
            stock_level = current stock before this round
            if (count_D > threshold) and (stock_level < depletion_threshold):
                action = D with probability proportional to count_D
            else:
                action = C
```

**Edge Cases**:
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate.
- **Last Rounds**: Consider increasing Defection to maximize payoffs, but be cautious not to deplete the stock excessively.

This strategy balances sustainability with adaptability, encouraging cooperation while having mechanisms to address excessive defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_285 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock and Peer Behavior**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Starting with cooperation sets a positive example, encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Assessment of Current Stock:**
     - If the current stock (`S`) is above 75% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
         - High stock indicates sustainability, so cooperation preserves resource health.
     - If `S` is below 25% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect
         - Low stock signals potential collapse; defecting maximizes immediate gain.
     - If `S` is between 25% and 75%:
       - **Peer Behavior Analysis:**
         - Estimate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round(s).
         - If more than half Cooperated:
           - **Action:** Cooperate
             - Majority cooperation suggests collective effort to sustain resources.
         - Else:
           - **Action:** Defect
             - High defection rate indicates exploitation; defecting prevents being exploited.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - No future rounds, so maximize immediate payoff.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `S` is exactly at a threshold (e.g., 25% or 75%), default to Cooperating to preserve the resource.
   - Track others' actions and payoffs to infer their strategies without explicit communication.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, capacity, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
        low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
        
        if current_stock > high_threshold:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock < low_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:

            recent_rounds = history[-min(3, len(history)):]
            other_cooperations = [h['others_cooperate'] for h in recent_rounds]

            if avg_coop > 0.5:

    others_cooperate = (sum(current_actions) - 1) / (len(current_actions) - 1)

```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy begins with Cooperation to foster a sustainable environment.
- It adapts based on the current stock level and observed cooperation from peers, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.
- In the last round, it defects to maximize payoff, recognizing that future rounds are nonexistent.

This approach aims to optimize total payoffs by dynamically adjusting behavior in response to both resource levels and peer actions.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Cooperate:** Start by Cooperating to encourage collective sustainability and higher payoffs.
   - **Monitor and Retaliate:** Track opponents' actions. If a player defects, respond with defection in future rounds to deter further exploitation.
   - **Grace Periods:** Allow a period after defection before retaliating to incentivize cooperation resumption.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** Cooperate if the stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity). Defect below this threshold to secure remaining resources.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to build initial trust and encourage mutual benefits.
   - **Last Rounds:** Defect in final rounds to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds don't offer rewards.

3. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   - The strategy emphasizes mutual benefit by maintaining the resource pool while allowing necessary defections to prevent exploitation. It's designed to adapt to various opponent behaviors, promoting cooperation when beneficial and protecting against defection when needed.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```pseudocode
Function Strategy(player_index, history, current_stock):
    If current_round == 1:
        Return Cooperate
    Else:
        Check if any opponent defected in the last 'grace_period' rounds
        If yes:
            Return Defect
        Else:
            If current_stock > threshold (e.g., 0.75 * capacity):
                Return Cooperate
            Else:
                Return Defect
    End If

Handle last few rounds:
    If remaining_rounds <= grace_period + 1:
        Return Defect
```

This strategy balances cooperation with necessary defections, adapting dynamically to sustain the common pool resource while ensuring individual payoff maximization.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_287 = '''
The optimal strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances cooperation with defection based on several key factors: current stock levels, the number of remaining rounds, and the historical behavior of other players. Here's an organized approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Encourage a cooperative environment by setting a positive example, helping to maintain high stock levels.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels and Cooperation Rate:**
     - If the stock is above 70% of capacity and more than 80% of players are cooperating, continue to cooperate.
     - If the stock drops below 50%, or if less than 60% of players are cooperating in recent rounds, begin defecting more frequently.

3. **Later Rounds (Last 20%):**
   - **Action:** Increase defection rate.
   - **Rationale:** With fewer future rounds left, prioritize immediate gains. However, maintain some cooperation if the stock is still healthy to allow for sustained growth.

4. **Low Stock Situations:**
   - If the stock drops below 25%:
     - Consider a mix of cooperation and defection to prevent rapid depletion while trying to recover the stock.
     - Monitor others' actions; if many are defecting, defect as well but be prepared to switch back to cooperation if needed.

### Responsive Adjustments

- **Adaptation Based on Others' Actions:**
  - Track the proportion of cooperators. If a significant majority (80%) cooperate, continue cooperating.
  - If less than 60% cooperate, increase defection rate to avoid being exploited while others defect.

- **Dynamic Thresholds:**
  - Adjust cooperation and defection thresholds based on the number of remaining rounds and current stock health.
  - For instance, in later rounds with ample stock, prioritize higher defection rates for immediate gains.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase:**
   - Cooperate in the first few rounds to build a cooperative foundation.

2. **Cooperation Monitoring:**
   - Track the percentage of players defecting each round.
   - Use this data to decide whether to continue cooperating or start defecting.

3. **Adjustment Based on Stock:**
   - Maintain cooperation if stock is high and others are mostly cooperating.
   - Gradually increase defection as stock decreases or cooperation rates fall below a certain threshold.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - As rounds near completion, prioritize immediate gains through defection, but remain flexible based on remaining stock capacity.

### Summary

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on current conditions and others' behaviors. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and adapts to exploit or mitigate defection as needed.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_288 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing points while considering future rounds and opponents' actions, we propose a balanced approach that adapts based on the current game state and historical behavior. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to maintain a cooperative equilibrium.

2. **Mid-Game Adaptation**:
   - Monitor recent cooperation rates among other players.
   - Check if the current stock level is above a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity).
   - If both conditions are met (high cooperation and healthy stock), continue cooperating.
   - Otherwise, defect to either prevent exploitation or salvage remaining resources.

3. **End-Game Defection**: In the last few rounds, switch to always defecting to maximize immediate points since future rounds no longer influence decisions.

This strategy ensures a balance between maintaining resource sustainability and maximizing immediate gains, adapting dynamically to changing game conditions.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially, adapt based on cooperation rates and stock levels, defect near the end.}}

description_COLLECTIVE_289 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Altruism Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy, named **Adaptive Altruism**, is designed to foster cooperation while protecting against exploitation in the Common Pool Resource Game. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on previous rounds' outcomes.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to encourage others to do the same, promoting a sustainable stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If in the previous round, at least 70% of players Cooperated:
     - Cooperate (C) to maintain positive dynamics and promote long-term gains.
   - If fewer than 30% of players Cooperated in the previous round:
     - Defect (D) to prevent being exploited by those who are defecting.
   - For cases between 30% and 70%, adjust based on trends over multiple rounds.

### Edge Cases:

- **Last Round:**
  - If it's the last round, players might consider defects for higher immediate payoff. However, stick with the adaptive rule to maintain sustainability unless exploitation is evident.
  
- **Early Defectors:**
  - Monitor and adapt if a few start defecting; respond by defecting to protect against rapid depletion.

### Strategy Implementation:

The strategy adapts dynamically, rewarding cooperation when prevalent and defecting when necessary. This approach aims to maximize collective payoffs while preventing resource collapse by balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function decide_action(previous_rounds):
    if current_round == 1:
        return C
    else:
        cooperate_count = count of players who Cooperated in previous round
        total_players = n
        cooperation_rate = cooperate_count / total_players
        
        if cooperation_rate >= 0.7:
            return C
        elif cooperation_rate <= 0.3:
            return D
        else:
            # Consider trends or additional factors, e.g., recent changes in cooperation rate
            # For simplicity, continue Cooperating but monitor for future adaptation
            return C
```

### Conclusion:

Adaptive Altruism encourages a cooperative environment by starting positively and adapting based on others' actions. It promotes sustainability while protecting against exploitation, balancing immediate gains with long-term resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_290 = '''
To address the problem of sustainably managing a shared resource through cooperation or defection based on the current stock level, we propose a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

### Approach
The strategy is centered around observing the current stock level and making decisions based on whether it meets a predetermined threshold. The key decision points are:

1. **Decision Rule**: Cooperate if the current stock is at least 60% of the capacity; otherwise, defect.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - In the first round, start with cooperation since the stock begins at full capacity.
   - For the last round, apply the same decision rule to avoid overharvesting.

This approach ensures that cooperation continues when the resource is sufficiently abundant, promoting sustainability. If the stock falls below the threshold, defection is chosen to maximize immediate gains without further depleting an already strained resource.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(stock_level, capacity):
    threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    return 'Cooperate' if stock_level >= threshold else 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
- **Decision Rule**: The strategy uses a threshold of 60% of the capacity to determine whether to cooperate or defect. This threshold is chosen to maintain a buffer that allows for sustainable growth and prevents resource collapse.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
  - **First Round**: Cooperation is initiated as the stock starts at full capacity, which meets the threshold.
  - **Last Round**: The same decision rule applies, ensuring cooperation if the stock remains above the threshold, thus avoiding unnecessary depletion.

This strategy adaptively responds to changes in the resource level, encouraging sustainable practices while accounting for potential defection by others.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_291 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round based on the cooperation rate of other players and the current stock level, we can formulate a strategy as follows:

**Strategy:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Defect.

3. **Other Rounds:**
   - Calculate the moving average of the cooperation rate over recent rounds (e.g., the last 3-5 rounds).
   - If the current stock level is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), Cooperate to aid in rebuilding the stock.
   - Else if both the moving average cooperation rate exceeds a certain level (e.g., 60%) and the current stock level is above another threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect.

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation in the First Round:** This serves as an initial positive signal to encourage others to cooperate, fostering a cooperative environment from the start.
  
- **Defection in the Last Round:** Since there are no future rounds to consider, maximizing immediate payoff by defecting is optimal.

- **Moving Average Cooperation Rate:** Using a moving average smoothens out volatility in cooperation rates from round to round, leading to more stable and predictable decisions.

- **Critical Stock Threshold:** When the stock is critically low, prioritizing cooperation helps prevent further depletion and allows the resource to recover in subsequent rounds.

- **Balancing Cooperation and Stock Health:** By considering both cooperation levels and stock health, the strategy ensures that cooperation is maintained when conditions are favorable, thereby supporting sustainable resource management. Defecting occurs only when necessary, either due to insufficient cooperation from others or a stressed resource state.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation under healthy conditions and defecting when it becomes advantageous or necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_292 = '''
The proposed strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a Common Pool Resource Game. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin each round by Cooperating (C) to maintain or build the common stock, ensuring sustainable growth.

2. **Monitor Defection**: Track the number of players who Defect (D) in each round. This helps determine if cooperation is being maintained or if there's excessive defection.

3. **Adaptive Defection Threshold**:
   - If the number of Defectors exceeds a threshold (e.g., half the players), switch to defecting for a few rounds to reduce consumption and incentivize others to cooperate in future rounds by lowering their payoffs when they defect.
   - The threshold can be dynamically adjusted based on historical behavior and stock levels.

4. **Stock-Based Adjustment**:
   - If the current stock is below a safe level (e.g., 30% of capacity), increase cooperation efforts to allow the stock to recover, ensuring sustainable growth in subsequent rounds.

5. **Return to Cooperation**: After periods of high defection or when the stock recovers, revert to Cooperating to sustain the resource and maximize collective payoffs.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to start on a positive note.
   - **Last Round**: Consider Cooperating to end on a positive note, potentially encouraging others in future interactions, though defecting might be beneficial if exploiting others is possible without future consequences.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
for each round:
    if it's the first round:
        action = C
    else:
        count_defectors = number of D actions in last round

        safe_level = 0.3 * capacity  # Example threshold
        
        if current_stock < safe_level:
            action = C  # Cooperate to allow stock recovery
        elif count_defectors > (n / 2):
            action = D  # Defect to punish excessive defection
        else:
            action = C  # Continue Cooperating
            
    perform action and record payoff
```

### Summary

This strategy starts with cooperation, adapts based on the number of defectors and stock levels, and includes mechanisms to punish excessive defection while ensuring long-term sustainability. It aims to encourage mutual cooperation for collective benefit while being resilient to varying opponent behaviors.

The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game effectively balances between exploiting the resource when it is abundant and conserving it when it is scarce. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy adapts to both the current state of the stock and historical player behavior, switching between two modes: Exploitation and Conservation.

#### Modes:
1. **Exploitation Mode**: Activated when the stock is above 75% of capacity.
   - **Cooperate (C)** if fewer than 2/3 of other players Cooperated in previous rounds.
   - **Defect (D)** otherwise, exploiting others' cooperation for higher payoff.

2. **Conservation Mode**: Activated when the stock is below 50% of capacity.
   - Always **Cooperate (C)** to minimize consumption and allow the stock to recover.

#### Initialization
- For the first 1-2 rounds, default to Cooperate to encourage sustainability and build a cooperative environment.

#### Last Round Consideration
- In the final round, if in Exploit Mode and the stock is above 50%, consider Defecting for immediate gain without worrying about future depletions.

### Decision Rules Summary
- **Stock > 75% Capacity**: Exploit by Cooperating only if fewer than 2/3 of others have Cooperated; otherwise, Defect.
- **50% < Stock ≤ 75%**: Transition phase where behavior shifts based on stock trends and recent player actions.
- **Stock ≤ 50%**: Conserve by always Cooperating to rebuild the stock.

### Edge Cases Handling
- **First Rounds**: Default to Cooperate to foster cooperation and sustainable resource use.
- **Final Round**: If in Exploit Mode and stock is sufficient, Defect for higher payoff without future concerns.
- **Low Stock (≤50%)**: Always Cooperate to prevent further depletion and aid recovery.

This strategy dynamically adapts to the game's state and player behavior, promoting long-term sustainability while allowing exploitation when advantageous. It ensures a balance between individual gain and collective responsibility, making it robust against various opponent strategies.

description_COLLECTIVE_294 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with future sustainability in a repeated resource harvesting game, we propose a strategic approach based on observing the current stock level relative to a predetermined threshold. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Determine a Threshold (X):** Set X as 80% of the maximum capacity (C). This means if the current stock (S) is above 80% of C, it is sustainable enough to continue Cooperating.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If S ≥ X: Choose to Cooperate. This helps maintain the resource level for future rounds, ensuring continued harvesting.
   - If S < X: Choose to Defect. When the stock is below this threshold, defecting maximizes immediate payoff while acknowledging that the resource may not sustain high yields in subsequent rounds.

3. **Implementation:** Apply this rule in each round based on the current observed stock level. This strategy encourages sustainable practices when possible and adapts by maximizing short-term gains when the resource is depleted.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to Cooperate if the current stock is above 80% of capacity; otherwise, Defect.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S \geq 0.8C \text{ else Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_295 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation with strategic defection based on the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round:** Start by Cooperating to encourage others to maintain the resource.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Assess Cooperation Level:** Determine if most players Cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Stock Health Check:** Evaluate whether the current stock is above a sustainable threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
3. **Decision Making:**
   - **Cooperate** if there's high cooperation among others and the stock is healthy.
   - **Defect** if cooperation is low or the stock is critically low, to maximize immediate payoff before potential depletion.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initialization:**
   - In the first round, choose to Cooperate (C).

2. **For Each Subsequent Round:**
   a. **Calculate Previous Cooperation:** Determine the number of players who Cooperated in the previous round.
   b. **Check Stock Level:** Assess if the current stock is above a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
   c. **Decision Criteria:**
      - If most players (more than half) Cooperated and the stock is above the threshold, choose to Cooperate.
      - Otherwise, choose to Defect.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Consider Cooperating if the stock is still sufficient; otherwise, defect to maximize final payoff.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is critically low, prioritize Defection to secure higher immediate payoffs.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock, capacity):
    n = number_of_players()
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        prev_round_coops = count Cooperators in history[round_number-2]
        stock_threshold = capacity * 0.5  # Example threshold
        if (prev_round_coops > n/2) and (current_stock >= stock_threshold):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages sustainability and sets a positive precedent.
- **Adaptive Behavior:** Adjusts based on others' actions, promoting mutual cooperation or defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion.
- **Stock Management:** Aims to maintain the stock within a sustainable range to ensure long-term benefits while allowing for strategic defection when needed.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to other players' behaviors and the evolving state of the common pool resource.
'''

The optimal strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting based on others' behavior and current stock levels. Here's the structured approach:

2. **Middle Phase:**
   - **Monitor:**

     - **Reasoning:** Maximize immediate payoff with no future impact.

4. **Edge Cases:**

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_297 = '''
**Strategy Overview:**

The strategy is designed to adaptively balance cooperation and defection based on the observed state of the common pool resource. It starts with cooperation to encourage sustainability, monitors stock trends, and adjusts actions dynamically.

---

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to promote a sustainable start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the moving average of stock levels over the last k rounds (k=3).
   - If the moving average is above a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), Cooperate.
   - If below the threshold, Defect.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Choose to Cooperate or Defect based on which action yields a higher immediate payoff given the current stock level.

---

**Threshold and Parameters:**

- The threshold can be set dynamically as 70% of capacity, but may adjust based on game parameters like n (number of players) and r (number of rounds).
- Using a moving average over k=3 rounds helps smooth out fluctuations and prevent premature switching between cooperation and defection.

---

**Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to encourage others to do the same.
- **Last Round:** Maximize immediate payoff without regard for future consequences, as there are no subsequent rounds.

---

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decision_function(history, current_stock, capacity):
    n_rounds = len(history) + 1  # Including current round
    if n_rounds == 1:
        return 'C'  # First round cooperation

    # For middle rounds (not first or last)
    k = 3
    start_index = max(0, n_rounds - k - 1)
    recent_stocks = [state.stock for state in history[start_index:-1]]
    moving_avg = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)

    threshold = capacity * 0.7

    if moving_avg > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def last_round_decision(current_stock, n_players):
    # Calculate payoffs for C and D
    payoff_C = current_stock / (2 * n_players)
    payoff_D = current_stock / n_players
    return 'C' if payoff_C > payoff_D else 'D'
```

---

**Conclusion:**

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on observed stock trends, promoting sustainability while being responsive to changes in resource levels. It handles edge cases by starting with cooperation and maximizing immediate gains in the final round.

description_COLLECTIVE_298 = '''
To address the weaknesses in the Tithe and Share strategy, particularly its vulnerability to coordinated defections leading to irreversible resource depletion, a revised strategy is proposed. This enhanced approach integrates dynamic adjustments based on growth potential, incorporates memory of past behaviors, and includes mechanisms to encourage recovery from low-resource states.

**Revised Strategy: Dynamic Cooperation with Recovery Mechanisms**

1. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment Based on Growth Potential:**
   - Instead of using a fixed threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity), calculate the threshold dynamically by considering the potential growth of the resource given its current level.
   - For example, if the stock is low but has high growth potential due to the term \(1 - \frac{S}{C}\) in the growth function, players are more inclined to Cooperate to facilitate recovery.

2. **Memory of Past Behaviors:**
   - Maintain a moving average or weighted history of cooperation rates from previous rounds.
   - If a significant proportion of players have been Cooperating recently, continue to Cooperate; conversely, if there's a trend towards Defection, adjust the threshold accordingly to prevent rapid depletion.

3. **Gradual Response Mechanism:**
   - Instead of an abrupt switch from C to D when crossing the threshold, implement a probabilistic response where the likelihood of Cooperating decreases as the stock falls below the threshold but doesn't drop to zero immediately.
   - This creates a smoother transition and reduces the risk of sudden collapses in cooperation.

4. **Recovery Periods:**
   - After detecting a period of Defection that causes the stock to drop, implement a predetermined number of rounds where players Cooperate regardless of the current stock level (up to a maximum to prevent overconsumption).
   - This allows the resource time to recover without relying solely on others' cooperation.

5. **Majority Following with Hysteresis:**
   - Follow the majority action but incorporate hysteresis, meaning that once players switch to Defecting, they require a higher threshold of Cooperation in subsequent rounds before reverting back.
   - This prevents oscillations between C and D due to fluctuating majority actions.

6. **Exploration Phase with Risk Assessment:**
   - In the initial rounds, experiment with both C and D while monitoring the impact on resource levels and payoffs.
   - Use this phase to assess whether Defection is sustainable without causing long-term harm to the resource base.

**Implementation Steps:**

- **Step 1:** Begin each round by evaluating the current stock level \(S\) and calculating the dynamic threshold based on potential growth. This involves assessing how much the stock can recover given its current state.
  
- **Step 2:** Review the history of actions from previous rounds to determine recent trends in cooperation rates. Use this information to adjust the threshold dynamically, considering both past behaviors and current resource conditions.

- **Step 3:** Decide whether to Cooperate or Defect by comparing the current stock level against the dynamic threshold and considering the probabilistic response mechanism. This step may involve a weighted decision where Cooperation is favored if the stock is near or above the threshold, especially with high growth potential.

- **Step 4:** If the stock has recently been low but shows signs of recovery (e.g., increasing after several rounds of Cooperation), implement recovery periods to further rebuild the resource. During these periods, players prioritize Cooperation even if the current stock is slightly below the usual threshold.

- **Step 5:** Continuously monitor the impact of actions on the resource and adjust strategies accordingly. Use feedback from past rounds to refine thresholds and response probabilities, ensuring adaptability to changing conditions.

**Example Walkthrough:**

Suppose we have n=4 players, capacity C=100, starting with S=100.

- **Round 1:** All Cooperate (C). Stock remains sustainable.
  
- **Round 2:** One player defects (D). Stock drops but is still above the dynamic threshold. Players observe this and note the impact on growth.

- **Rounds 3-5:** Despite one defector, others continue to Cooperate because S remains high enough and shows potential for recovery. The dynamic threshold adjusts based on observed growth rates.

- **Round 6:** Two players defect. Stock drops below the dynamic threshold. Players now consider both the stock level and past cooperation trends.

- **Rounds 7-9:** Observing a trend towards Defection, some players revert to Cooperating to allow resource recovery. The majority following with hysteresis mechanism kicks in, encouraging others to join in rebuilding the stock.

- **Round 10 onwards:** Stock starts recovering due to increased Cooperation. Players adjust their strategies back to normal thresholds, ensuring sustainable use moving forward.

This revised strategy balances immediate gains from Defection with long-term sustainability by dynamically adapting to resource conditions and historical cooperation patterns, thereby enhancing resilience against coordinated defections and promoting overall system health.

description_COLLECTIVE_299 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we'll outline a strategy that balances immediate payoff maximization with the sustainability of the shared resource. The solution involves dynamic threshold adjustments based on recent stock trends and game progression.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Start by Cooperating in the initial rounds to build a stable foundation for the resource.
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust thresholds for low, medium, and high stock levels dynamically as the game progresses. This ensures that decisions adapt to changing conditions over time.
3. **Recent Trends Analysis**: Track recent stock levels to determine if the resource is increasing or decreasing, influencing whether to Cooperate or Defect.
4. **Endgame Handling**: In the final rounds, prioritize immediate payoff by defecting more, as future consequences are less significant.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(stock, history, round_number, total_rounds, capacity, n):
    # Initial parameters
    initial_coop = 3  # Cooperate in the first few rounds
    if round_number <= initial_coop:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent trends based on last 10 rounds of stock levels
    recent_stock = history[-10:] if len(history) >= 10 else history
    avg_stock = sum(recent_stock) / len(recent_stock) if recent_stock else capacity
    
    # Determine thresholds adjusted by game progress
    progress = round_number / total_rounds
    low_threshold = max(0.2 * capacity, 0.4 * capacity * (1 - progress))
    high_threshold = min(0.8 * capacity, 0.6 * capacity + 0.2 * capacity * (1 - progress))
    
    # Calculate growth trend over recent rounds
    if len(recent_stock) > 1:
        growth_trend = stock - recent_stock[-1]
    else:
        growth_trend = 0
    
    # Decide based on thresholds and trends
    if stock < low_threshold or avg_stock < low_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif stock > high_threshold and avg_stock > (high_threshold * 0.9):
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Compare expected payoffs
        payoff_C = stock / (2 * n)
        payoff_D = stock / n
        
        # Consider future rounds impact
        remaining_rounds = total_rounds - round_number
        if remaining_rounds == 0:
            future_weight = 0
        else:
            future_weight = 1 / remaining_rounds
        
        expected_payoff_C = payoff_C + (future_weight * 2)  # Higher weight for sustainability
        expected_payoff_D = payoff_D - (future_weight * 1)  # Penalize for potential depletion
        
        if expected_payoff_D > expected_payoff_C:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The first few rounds are dedicated to Cooperating to ensure the resource doesn't deplete immediately.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: As the game progresses, thresholds adjust to reflect the remaining rounds, ensuring decisions remain relevant to the current state of the game.
- **Recent Trends Analysis**: By examining recent stock levels, the strategy adapts to whether the resource is growing or shrinking, influencing the decision to Cooperate or Defect.
- **Endgame Handling**: In the final 20% of rounds, defecting becomes more favorable as future consequences are less impactful.

This approach efficiently balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring a competitive yet responsible strategy for managing shared resources.

**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Start with Cooperate (C) in the first round to encourage a sustainable stock level.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Observe the previous round's actions:
     - If more than 50% of players Cooperated, continue Cooperating.
     - If fewer than 30% Cooperated, switch to Defect (D) to signal disapproval and potentially punish Defectors.
   - Adjust thresholds based on stock dynamics. If the stock is below 60% of capacity, prioritize Cooperating to aid recovery.

3. **Final Rounds:**
   - In the last few rounds, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoffs since there's no future benefit from maintaining a higher stock.

4. **Stock-Based Adjustments:**
   - Monitor the current stock level:
     - If the stock is below 60% of capacity, prioritize Cooperating to help it regrow.
     - If the stock is high and stable (close to capacity), continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability.

**Summary of Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate.
- **Middle Rounds:**
  - Cooperate if >50% of players Cooperated last round.
  - Defect if <30% Cooperated, especially if the stock is declining.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Defect to maximize immediate payoffs.
- **Stock Thresholds:**
  - Cooperate if stock <60% to aid recovery.
  - Continue Cooperating at higher stock levels for sustainability.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on observed player behavior and current stock conditions, encouraging sustainable resource use while protecting against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_301 = '''
**Final Strategy Design for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
To sustainably manage the common pool resource while maximizing cumulative payoffs over multiple rounds by encouraging cooperation among players.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Justification: Establish a baseline of cooperation to encourage others to follow suit, promoting sustainable resource use.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Evaluate the following conditions:
     - **Condition A:** Percentage of Cooperators in the previous round exceeds 60%.
     - **Condition B:** Current stock level is above 60% of capacity.
   - Decision:
     - If both Condition A and Condition B are met: **Cooperate.**
     - If either condition is not met: **Defect.**
       - Justification: Defection signals to others that resource depletion is unacceptable, incentivizing future cooperation.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Evaluate the current stock level:
     - If the stock is above 60% of capacity: **Cooperate.**
     - If the stock is below or equal to 60%: **Defect.**
       - Justification: While defecting in the final round maximizes immediate payoff, defecting only when necessary helps maintain sustainability for potential future interactions (though the game ends here).

---

### **Edge Cases and Considerations:**

- **Stock Near Capacity:**
  - Continue Cooperating to preserve the resource's health.
  
- **Low Stock Levels:**
  - Defect to signal others of the urgency, aiming to reset cooperation in subsequent rounds.

- **Dynamic Adaptation:**
  - Adjust actions each round based on updated stock levels and cooperation rates from previous rounds.

---

### **Pseudocode Representation:**

```python
def decide_action(player_id, history, current_stock):
    # Initial Round (Round 1)
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Extract previous round's actions
    prev_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    num_cooperators = sum(1 for action in prev_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    cooperation_rate = num_cooperators / len(prev_actions)
    
    # Critical thresholds
    critical_stock = 0.6 * capacity
    critical_cooperation = 0.6
    
    # Current round conditions
    condition_a = cooperation_rate >= critical_cooperation
    condition_b = current_stock >= critical_stock
    
    # Last Round Check
    if len(history) == r - 1:
        return 'C' if current_stock > critical_stock else 'D'
    
    # Decision Logic for Middle Rounds
    if condition_a and condition_b:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

---

### **Rationale:**

- **Cooperation Promotion:** Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent, encouraging others to maintain sustainable practices.
  
- **Threshold-Based Adaptation:** Using cooperation rates and stock levels ensures the strategy is responsive to current conditions without requiring direct communication.

- **Defection as a Signal:** When resource depletion or low cooperation is detected, defecting serves as a collective signal to reset behavior, preventing long-term resource collapse.

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while promoting cooperative outcomes.

description_COLLECTIVE_302 = '''
To address the problem of encouraging cooperation in a resource management scenario, we propose a strategy that begins with cooperation and adapts based on the recent behavior of other players. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to promote sustainable use of the resource.

2. **Monitor Recent Behavior**: For each subsequent round, observe the actions of other players from the previous round.

3. **Majority Check**: Determine if more than half of the other players defected in the last round. If so, defect this round; otherwise, continue cooperating.

4. **Adapt and Reassess**: Continuously apply this rule to adapt your strategy based on others' recent actions, encouraging cooperation when prevalent and defecting only when widespread.

This approach aims to maintain cooperation unless a significant portion of players start exploiting the system, at which point it switches to defection to maximize individual gain while preventing resource depletion. The strategy balances between fostering sustainable practices and responding to potential exploitation.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate in the first round; defect if more than half of other players defected in the previous round, otherwise cooperate.}}$

description_COLLECTIVE_303 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability. This strategy is adaptive, robust, and designed to handle various opponent behaviors while promoting collective cooperation. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT)

1. **Initial Round:** Begin with Cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and encourage resource sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:** Implement a dynamic decision-making process based on the current stock level and historical behavior of other players.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
   - **Cooperate:** If the current stock is above a dynamically adjusted threshold.
   - **Defect:** If the current stock is below this threshold or if there's evidence of widespread defection by others.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Adjust the threshold based on past stock levels, consumption rates, and the proportion of Cooperators vs. Defectors observed in previous rounds.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Start with Cooperate.
   - **Last Round:** Consider defecting if the stock is low to maximize immediate gain without concern for future rounds.
   - **Mid Rounds:** Focus on maintaining or restoring the resource level through cooperation, defecting only when necessary.

### Decision Rules

- **Action Selection:**
  - If the current stock (S) > dynamic threshold (T): Cooperate.
  - Else: Defect.

- **Threshold Adjustment:**
  - Calculate T based on historical data and observed player behavior:
    - Increase T if previous rounds showed cooperation leading to resource replenishment.
    - Decrease T if defection was prevalent, indicating the need for a more conservative approach.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, n, capacity):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate dynamic threshold based on history and current state
    past_coops = sum(1 for h in history if h['action'] == 'C')
    total_rounds = len(history)
    coop_ratio = past_coops / total_rounds if total_rounds > 0 else 1.0
    
    # Base threshold as a fraction of capacity
    base_threshold = capacity * 0.75  # Can be adjusted based on empirical testing
    adjusted_threshold = max(base_threshold, current_stock - (n * 2))  # Prevents negative thresholds

    # If most players are Cooperating, raise the threshold; else lower it
    if coop_ratio > 0.6:
        adjusted_threshold = min(adjusted_threshold + capacity*0.1, capacity)
    else:
        adjusted_threshold = max(adjusted_threshold - capacity*0.1, 0)
    
    # Decision based on current stock and adjusted threshold
    if current_stock >= adjusted_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Strategy Explanation

- **Cooperation Initiation:** Starting with Cooperate sets a positive precedent, encouraging others to follow suit, which helps in maintaining the resource for future rounds.

- **Threshold Adaptation:** The threshold is dynamically adjusted based on past interactions. If cooperation has been successful, the threshold is raised, promoting continued cooperation. Conversely, if defection is prevalent, the threshold is lowered to allow for more cautious decision-making.

- **Defection as a Last Resort:** Defecting is reserved for situations where the resource is critically low or when others are defecting excessively, preventing individual exploitation and maximizing immediate gains when necessary.

This strategy ensures adaptability, promotes collective cooperation while being resilient against defectors, making it robust across various game scenarios.

description_COLLECTIVE_304 = '''
To address the problem of determining a cooperative strategy in a repeated game with perfect information, we propose an adaptive approach that considers both the cooperation rate among players and the health of the shared resource. This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on observed behavior and resource levels.

### Strategy Steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set thresholds: 60% for Cooperators, 70% for Stock (relative to initial capacity).
   - Define a lookback window of the last 3 rounds.
   - Identify the final two rounds as critical periods for adjusting strategy.

2. **Round 1**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate
     - Justification: Encourages sustainability and sets a positive example.

3. **For Rounds 2 to (r - 2)**:
   - **Step 1**: Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the last 3 rounds.
   - **Step 2**: Compute the average stock level over these same 3 rounds.
   - **Decision**:
     - If both the cooperation rate is ≥60% and the average stock is ≥70%, **Cooperate**.
     - Else, **Defect** to maximize immediate payoff or prevent resource collapse.

4. **For Last Two Rounds (r - 1 and r)**:
   - **Round (r - 1)**:
     - If the average stock level in the last round was ≥80%, **Cooperate** to preserve the resource for the final round.
     - Else, **Defect** to exploit remaining resources.
   - **Round r**:
     - **Action**: Defect
       - Justification: Maximizes immediate payoff with no future rounds affected.

### Explanation:

- **Initial Round Cooperation**: Starts positive to encourage others and maintain resource levels.
- **Dynamic Adaptation (Rounds 2 to penultimate)**: Adjusts actions based on recent cooperation rates and stock health, promoting stability when conditions are favorable and defecting when necessary.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment**: Balances between preserving resources in the penultimate round for a potential higher payoff in the last round, while ensuring maximum gain in the final move without concern for future rounds.

This strategy is robust against varying player behaviors and resource dynamics, aiming to achieve a collectively optimal outcome through informed adaptability.

  - Cooperate to encourage others and establish a sustainable resource base.

- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  1. Calculate the proportion of opponents who Cooperated in the previous round:
     - \( p = \frac{\text{Number of Cooperators}}{\text{n - 1}} \)
  2. Determine thresholds based on current stock level (\( S \)):
     - If \( S > 70\% \) of capacity, set a lower cooperation threshold (e.g., 50%).
     - Else, set a higher cooperation threshold (e.g., 60%).
  3. Decision:
     - If \( p \geq \text{threshold} \), Cooperate.
     - Else, Defect.

---

### **2. Stock Consideration**

- Track the stock level and adjust thresholds accordingly:
  - If the stock has been consistently high (e.g., above 70%), encourage more Cooperating by lowering the threshold.
  - If the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 50%), prioritize Cooperating to prevent collapse.

---

### **3. Edge Cases Handling**

- **Last Round:**
  - Defect, as there are no future rounds to consider.
  
- **Near Last Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds):**
  - Shift towards defecting unless the stock is very high and can sustain it without significant drop.

---

### **4. Learning Mechanism**

- After each round, analyze how decisions affected future stock levels:
  - If Cooperating when \( p \) was above threshold maintained or increased the stock, keep the same threshold.
  - If Cooperating when \( p \) was below threshold caused drops, lower the cooperation threshold for next time.

---

### **5. Implementation Notes**

- Use a moving average of past cooperation rates over the last k rounds (e.g., k=5) to smooth out fluctuations.
- Adjust thresholds dynamically based on observed trends in stock levels and opponent behavior.

---

### **6. Objective**

ACOB aims to maximize long-term payoffs by balancing individual exploitation with collective sustainability, adapting to changing conditions through dynamic decision-making based on opponents' behavior and resource levels.

---

**Note:** This strategy requires careful tuning of thresholds and may need adjustments based on specific game parameters (e.g., number of players, rounds) for optimal performance.

**Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 3-5 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Build a positive stock base and set a precedent for cooperation.

2. **Middle Rounds (After Initial Phase Until Last Few Rounds):**
   - **Dynamic Thresholds:**
     - **High Threshold (HT):** 80% of capacity.
     - **Low Threshold (LT):** 60% of capacity.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If current stock > HT: Cooperate.
     - If current stock < LT: Defect.
     - Between HT and LT:
       - Calculate average cooperation rate from previous rounds.
       - If average cooperation rate > 70%, Cooperate; else, Defect.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 3-5 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Tend towards Defecting (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff as future rounds have no impact.

4. **Adjustment of Thresholds:**
   - Dynamically adjust HT and LT each round based on observed stock trends:
     - If stock consistently above previous levels, increase HT.
     - If stock consistently below, decrease HT and lower LT.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate positive dynamics.
   - **Stock Collapse (stock near 0):** Defect to salvage immediate payoff.

6. **Implementation Approach:**
   - Use a state machine with conditional checks on stock levels, thresholds, and historical cooperation rates.
   - Adjust thresholds adaptively each round based on observed trends.

This strategy balances exploration in initial rounds, exploitation towards the end, and adapts dynamically to maintain sustainable stock levels while responding to opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_307 = '''
The optimal strategy for balancing cooperation with necessary defection, while maintaining resource sustainability, is as follows:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, Cooperate to establish a cooperative environment and maximize growth potential.

2. **Dynamic Thresholds Based on Stock Level:**
   - Divide the stock level into three zones:
     - **High Zone (S > 0.75 * capacity):** Cooperate to maintain sustainable consumption.
     - **Medium Zone (0.25 * capacity ≤ S ≤ 0.75 * capacity):** Use a mixed strategy with the probability of Cooperating, p = (S / capacity) * 0.8 + 0.2. This adjusts cooperation based on the stock level, encouraging more cooperation when resources are ample.
     - **Low Zone (S < 0.25 * capacity):** Defect unless over 75% of other players Cooperated in the last round, in which case Cooperate to foster recovery.

3. **Adaptation Based on Historical Cooperation:**
   - Track the average cooperation rate over the past m rounds (e.g., m=5).
   - If this rate is above a threshold (e.g., 70%), increase the tendency to Cooperate by adjusting p upwards.
   - If below a threshold (e.g., 30%), decrease cooperation, possibly forcing Defection in the medium zone.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - In the last round, consider defecting if S > 50% of capacity to maximize immediate payoff with no future consequences.
   - After significant stock drops, be cautious, leaning towards Defection until cooperation recovers.

This strategy encourages sustainable cooperation while adapting to resource levels and historical behavior, preventing over-depletion without relying on specific coordination. It balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, fostering a resilient approach against varying player strategies.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&1. \text{ Cooperate in the first round.} \\
&2. \text{ Use dynamic thresholds based on stock level:} \\
&&- \text{ High zone (S > 0.75C): Cooperate.} \\
&&- \text{ Medium zone (0.25C ≤ S ≤ 0.75C): Cooperate with probability p = (S/C) * 0.8 + 0.2.} \\
&&- \text{ Low zone (S < 0.25C): Defect unless >75% Cooperated last round.} \\
&3. \text{ Adapt cooperation rate based on historical behavior: Adjust p if average cooperation over past rounds is above/below thresholds.} \\
&4. \text{ Handle edge cases, e.g., defect in last round if S > 0.5C.}

To address the problem, we propose a strategic approach where each player begins by cooperating and continues to do so based on two conditions: the health of the resource (stock level) and the proportion of cooperators in previous rounds. If these conditions are not met, players defect, signaling others to cooperate more.

### Approach
1. **First Round**: All players start by cooperating.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Each player checks the stock level at the beginning of the previous round. If it was above 70% of capacity and more than half of the players cooperated in that round, they cooperate again.
   - Otherwise, they defect.

This strategy aims to maintain a healthy resource by encouraging cooperation when conditions are favorable and signaling others to adjust their behavior if they aren't.

### Solution Code
```python
def decision(history):
    # history is a list where each element is a tuple (s_prev, c_last)
    if not history:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    s_prev, c_last = history[-1]
    n_players = len(history[0][1]) if history else 1
    capacity = max(s for s, _ in history) if history else 100

    # Check conditions: stock above 70% and more than half cooperated last round
    if s_prev > 0.7 * capacity and c_last > n_players / 2:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The game starts with all players cooperating to encourage others to follow suit.
- **Stock Health Check**: Players monitor the resource's health, ensuring it stays above 70% of its capacity. This threshold ensures sustainability.
- **Cooperation Incentive**: By requiring more than half of players to cooperate in the previous round, players incentivize each other to maintain cooperative behavior for long-term benefits.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability by encouraging cooperation and signaling when changes are needed, preventing over-depletion and fostering a stable cooperative environment.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_309 = '''
**Final Answer**

The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining sustainability. It adapts based on others' actions and the resource's state, balancing cooperation with defecting when necessary.

1. **Initial Phase:**
   - Cooperate in the first few rounds to encourage sustainability.
   - Observe consumption patterns to assess others' strategies.

2. **Monitoring Indicators:**
   a. Average cooperation rate over recent rounds (last 3-5 rounds).
   b. Current stock level relative to capacity and optimal growth point (~capacity/2).

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - If average cooperation rate is above 70% and the stock is above 40% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
   - If cooperation rate drops below 70% or stock falls below 40% of capacity, switch to Defecting.

4. **Adaptation:**
   - Reassess indicators every round and adjust strategy based on new data.
   - In the last 10% of rounds, consider defecting more for higher immediate payoffs.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - First Round: Cooperate unconditionally.
   - Last Round(s): Consider defecting if it leads to a higher immediate payoff.

This approach balances sustainability with adaptability, ensuring long-term gains while protecting against resource depletion.

description_COLLECTIVE_310 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation with strategic defection to optimize long-term payoffs. Here's a structured overview of the approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Conditional Defection

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same and sustain the common pool.

2. **Stock Threshold for Defection**:
   - Calculate a defection threshold based on current stock (S), number of players (n), and capacity.
   - The threshold is set at `(capacity / n) * 0.8`, encouraging defection only when the stock can sustain it without rapid depletion.

3. **Defection Decision**: Defect if:
   - Current stock (S) > threshold.
   - Proportion of past defections by other players < 30%, indicating cooperation is still prevalent.

4. **Cooperation Adjustment**: If the proportion of past defections exceeds 30%, revert to cooperation to prevent over-depletion and promote sustainability.

5. **Endgame Consideration**: In the last 10% of rounds, switch to cooperation to preserve remaining stock, ensuring it can sustain through the final rounds without sudden depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, n_players, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate defection threshold
    threshold = (capacity / n_players) * 0.8
    
    # Determine past defection rate
    past_defections = sum(1 for action in history['other_actions'] if action == 'D') / len(history['other_actions'])
    
    # Check endgame condition
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        return 'C'
    
    # Decide based on threshold and past behavior
    if current_stock > threshold and past_defections < 0.3:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts with cooperation to foster a cooperative environment.
- **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold ensures defection only when the stock is sufficiently high, preventing rapid depletion.
- **Defection Decision**: Defecting is conditional on both stock levels and past behavior, aiming to exploit without encouraging widespread defection.
- **Adjustment for Past Behavior**: If others defect frequently, reverting to cooperation helps sustain the resource.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Switching to cooperation in later rounds preserves the stock, preventing a sudden drop that could reduce payoffs in final rounds.

This approach adaptively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, aiming to maximize cumulative payoff while encouraging cooperative behavior from others.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_311 = '''
To address the problem, we need to design an individual player's strategy for maximizing their gains in a common resource game without communication or enforcement mechanisms. The goal is to balance cooperation with defection based on the current state of the resource.

### Approach
The approach involves using a threshold-based strategy where cooperation and defection decisions are made based on the current stock level relative to a target (capacity/2). This target represents an optimal point for sustainable growth. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Target Stock Level**: Set at capacity/2, as this is where regrowth is maximized.
2. **Decision Rule**:
   - If the current stock is above the target, Cooperate to allow regrowth and maintain sustainability.
   - If the current stock is below the target, Defect to maximize immediate gains before potential collapse.

This strategy aims to sustain cooperation when possible while allowing defection as a reactive measure if cooperation isn't maintained by others.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_stock, capacity):
    target = capacity / 2
    if current_stock > target:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"
```

### Explanation
- **Target Stock Level**: The threshold is set at half the total resource capacity. This level is chosen because it balances the need for sufficient resources to sustain growth while allowing room for some depletion.
- **Decision Making**:
  - When `current_stock` exceeds the target, cooperation ensures that resources are preserved and can regrow, benefiting all players in the long term.
  - If `current_stock` falls below the target, defecting allows the player to maximize their immediate gain, recognizing that others may not be cooperating.

This strategy is a balance between long-term sustainability and short-term gains. It assumes that if cooperation isn't maintained by others, defecting can prevent further depletion leading to potential collapse.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_312 = '''
The decision rule for each player is as follows:

- **Cooperate** if the product of (current stock / capacity) and (remaining rounds / total rounds) exceeds 0.5.
- Otherwise, **Defect**.

This strategy ensures that players maintain cooperation when resources are abundant and time allows for future gains, while defecting when sustainability is threatened or in the final rounds to maximize immediate payoff.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if }(S/\text{capacity}) \times (R/r) > 0.5\text{; otherwise, Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_313 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can outline an adaptive and sustainable approach that balances immediate gains with long-term resource preservation. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

1. **Initial Cooperative Stance**:
   - Begin with cooperation in the first few rounds to maximize initial stock growth and set a positive precedent.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**:
   - Establish an adaptive threshold that determines when to switch from cooperation to defection.
   - The threshold starts at a high value, typically near the capacity, and decreases dynamically based on game progress and resource depletion.

3. **Threshold Adjustment Mechanism**:
   - **Time Decay**: Gradually lower the threshold as rounds progress to account for diminishing future gains.
   - **Stock Health Check**: Monitor the stock's health (e.g., growth rate) and adjust the threshold if it shows signs of significant depletion or poor regeneration.
   - **Behavioral Inference**: Use observed consumption patterns from past rounds to estimate collective cooperation levels. If the stock is depleting faster than expected, lower the threshold to encourage more defection.

4. **Defection in Later Rounds**:
   - As the game approaches its final rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds), increase the likelihood of defecting to prioritize immediate payoffs over future sustainability.

5. **Feedback Loop for Sustainability**:
   - Continuously assess whether cooperation efforts are maintaining or depleting the stock.
   - If the stock is not replenishing as expected, adjust the strategy to defect more frequently to prevent collapse.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_threshold_cooperation(player_id, history, parameters):
    n = parameters['n']
    r = parameters['r']
    capacity = parameters['capacity']
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    
    # Determine remaining rounds and calculate time decay factor
    remaining_rounds = r - current_round + 1
    time_decay = max(0.5, (remaining_rounds / r))  # Prevents threshold from dropping too low
    
    # Calculate initial threshold based on capacity and cooperation incentive
    base_threshold = capacity * 0.75  # Adjust as needed based on empirical testing
    adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * time_decay
    
    # Assess stock health and adjust threshold
    if current_round > 1:
        previous_stock = history[current_round - 2]['stock']
        current_stock = history[current_round - 1]['stock']
        
        # Estimate expected growth under different scenarios
        expected_growth_coop = calculate_expected_growth(previous_stock, n, capacity,coop_ratio=0.8)
        expected_growth_defect = calculate_expected_growth(previous_stock, n, capacity, coop_ratio=0.2)
        
        actual_growth = current_stock - (previous_stock - total_consumption)
        
        # If growth is lower than expected under cooperation, infer higher defection
        if actual_growth < expected_growth_coop * 0.8:
            adjusted_threshold *= 0.9
    
    # Decision rule based on current stock and threshold
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock'] if history else capacity
    if current_round <= r - (r // 5):  # Avoid early collapse by maintaining higher threshold
        if current_stock > adjusted_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # In later rounds, prioritize immediate gain
        return 'D'

def calculate_expected_growth(s_remaining, n, capacity, coop_ratio=0.5):
    total_consumption = (n * coop_ratio) * (s_remaining / (2*n)) + (n * (1 - coop_ratio)) * (s_remaining / n)
    s_after = s_remaining - total_consumption
    growth = 2 * s_after * (1 - s_after / capacity)
    return max(growth, 0)
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to foster resource sustainability and encourage others to do the same.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: By adjusting thresholds based on time decay and observed stock behavior, the strategy adapts to changing conditions and collective actions.
- **Defection in Later Rounds**: Recognizing that future gains diminish as rounds progress, the strategy shifts towards defection in the final stages to maximize immediate payoffs.

This approach ensures a balance between individual gain and collective resource preservation, making it robust against diverse opponent behaviors while remaining adaptable to various game conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_314 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to current stock levels, historical trends, and the number of rounds remaining. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - **Threshold Initialization:** Set an initial cooperation threshold at 80% of the capacity (e.g., `threshold = 0.8 * capacity`).
   - **Historical Tracking:** Maintain records of past stock levels and actions to inform future decisions.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - **Adjust Based on Outcomes:** After each round, analyze how cooperation affected stock growth. If cooperation led to higher stock, consider raising the threshold slightly for future rounds.
   - **Lower Threshold if Necessary:** If cooperation did not prevent stock decline, lower the threshold to encourage more defection in subsequent rounds.

3. **Decision Making Per Round:**
   - **Current Stock Check:** Compare the current stock level (`S`) with the dynamically adjusted threshold.
     - **Cooperate (C):** If `S > threshold`, choose cooperation to preserve the resource.
     - **Defect (D):** If `S ≤ threshold`, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

4. **Endgame Consideration:**
   - **Round Progress:** As rounds progress towards the total number of rounds (`r`), gradually increase the tendency to defect, especially in the last few rounds when future payoffs are less significant.
   - **Final Rounds Adjustment:** In the final 10% of rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds out of 50), prioritize defection to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future depletion.

5. **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
initialize threshold = 0.8 * capacity
historical_stock = [capacity]  # Initialize with starting stock

for round in range(r):
    current_stock = historical_stock[-1]
    
    if round >= r - (r // 10):  # Last 10% of rounds
        action = D
    else:
        if current_stock > threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    
    # Simulate the round and update stock for next iteration
    # (This part is illustrative; actual game mechanics handle stock)
    
    historical_stock.append(new_stock)
    adjust_threshold(threshold, historical_stock)

def adjust_threshold(threshold, historical_stock):
    # Example adjustment based on past trends
    if len(historical_stock) > 2:
        last_two = historical_stock[-2:]
        if last_two[1] > last_two[0]:
            threshold *= 1.05  # Increase threshold slightly
        else:
            threshold *= 0.95  # Decrease threshold slightly
    return threshold
```

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation Threshold:** The threshold ensures cooperation when resources are abundant, promoting sustainability.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Adapting the threshold based on past outcomes allows the strategy to respond to changing conditions, ensuring it remains effective even as player behaviors evolve.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Recognizing that later rounds have fewer future implications encourages players to defect more, maximizing their payoff without worrying about long-term consequences.

This strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors, as it adapts dynamically and doesn't rely on coordination with others. It balances immediate gains with the need for sustainable resource management over multiple rounds.

**Strategy: Adaptive Conservation with Threshold-Based Defection**

1. **Initial Rounds (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to preserve the high initial stock level.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - The current stock is above 75% of capacity.
     - Recent trends indicate stable or increasing stock levels.
   - **Defect** if:
     - The current stock is below 25% of capacity.
     - Recent stock levels are decreasing significantly (e.g., a negative trend over the last few rounds).

3. **Late Rounds (Last 2 Rounds):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the stock is zero, always defect.
   - In the final round, defect regardless of other factors.

    recent_stock = [s for s in history[-window_size:]]
    if len(recent_stock) > 1:
        average_change = (recent_stock[-1] - recent_stock[0]) / len(recent_stock)

    if stock > high_threshold and average_change >= 0:
        return 'C'
    elif stock < low_threshold or (average_change < -some_negative_value):

            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Cooperation:** Preserves the stock for future rounds when it's abundant.
- **Defection:** Maximizes immediate gain when the stock is low or rapidly decreasing, preventing long-term losses from over-depletion.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Adjusts based on current and recent stock levels to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

This strategy effectively navigates the trade-offs between individual gain and collective resource preservation, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios without relying on coordination mechanisms.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by promoting sustainability and setting a positive example.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Check:**
     - If current stock > 80% of capacity:
       - Action: Cooperate (C)
       - Rationale: High stock allows sustainable consumption.
     - If 60% ≤ stock ≤ 80% of capacity:
       - Action: Cooperate (C) but monitor others' actions.
       - Rationale: Moderate stock; balance between sustainability and potential adaptation.
     - If stock < 60% of capacity:
       - Action: Defect (D)
       - Rationale: Low stock indicates overuse, prioritize immediate payoff.

3. **Adaptation Based on Previous Round's Actions:**
   - After each round, count the number of players who Defected.
   - If >50% Defected in the last round:
     - Action: Switch to Defect (D) for next rounds until stock recovers or cooperation resumes.
     - Rationale: Detect shift towards depletion; adapt to maximize payoff.

4. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** No future benefit from preservation; take maximum possible payoff.

**Rationale:**
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It adapts dynamically based on stock levels and the behavior of other players, ensuring robustness against varying opponent strategies while promoting collective resource management when possible.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_317 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining cooperation in the face of potential defection while preserving the resource, a strategic approach based on monitoring the stock level relative to its capacity is proposed. The strategy involves two key thresholds: one for initiating cooperation and another for defecting when the resource shows signs of significant depletion.

**Strategy Explanation:**

1. **Threshold Setup:**
   - **Upper Threshold (75% of Capacity):** If the current stock is above this level, players should Cooperate. This indicates that the resource is healthy and sustainable, encouraging continued cooperation to maintain stability.
   
   - **Lower Threshold (50% of Capacity):** If the stock drops below this level, it suggests significant defection or overuse, prompting players to Defect. This action aims to maximize immediate gains while protecting against further depletion.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Players continuously monitor the stock level and its trend over recent rounds.
   - If the stock falls below 75%, players switch to Cooperating only if they observe signs of recovery or stable levels, indicating others are also cooperating.
   - Conversely, if the stock consistently remains below 75% despite cooperation attempts, players may adjust their strategy to defect more aggressively.

3. **Incentive Alignment:**
   - By setting these thresholds, the strategy aligns individual actions with collective sustainability. Cooperation is incentivized when the resource is healthy, while defection is reserved for times of significant stress, preventing complete collapse and encouraging others to cooperate.

**Conclusion:**

The proposed strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by using clear thresholds based on stock levels. It encourages cooperation during stable periods and adapts to potential collapses by allowing defection when necessary. This approach aims to maintain resource health while accounting for rational individual decision-making.

**Final Answer:**

Players should Cooperate if the current stock is above 75% of capacity, signaling a healthy resource that can sustain everyone's efforts. If the stock drops below 50%, players switch to Defecting to maximize their immediate gains and respond to potential overuse by others. This strategy balances cooperation with adaptability, encouraging sustainability while addressing inevitable defection risks.

To address the problem of designing a robust strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on the game's dynamic state. The strategy aims to maximize long-term payoffs by preserving the common pool resource while adapting to others' behaviors.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with cooperation in the first round to foster a sustainable resource level.
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Use thresholds that adjust based on remaining rounds and current stock levels:
   - Higher threshold when many rounds remain, encouraging sustainability.
   - Lower threshold as the game progresses, allowing for more defection if necessary.
3. **Stock Monitoring**: Track the stock trend over recent rounds to decide actions:
   - Cooperate if the stock is stable or increasing.
   - Defect if the stock is decreasing significantly.
4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - In early rounds, prioritize cooperation to build a sustainable resource.
   - In later rounds, be more willing to defect if the stock is low.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, remaining_rounds, capacity):
    # Determine thresholds based on remaining rounds
    if remaining_rounds > r / 2:
        threshold_high = 0.8 * capacity
        threshold_low = 0.3 * capacity
    else:
        threshold_high = 0.7 * capacity
        threshold_low = 0.2 * capacity

    if current_stock >= threshold_high:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock <= threshold_low:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate trend based on historical data (simplified)
        trend = calculate_trend()
        if trend in ['increasing', 'stable']:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

def calculate_trend():
    # Simplified example: check last two rounds
    if stock_history[-1] > stock_history[-2]:
        return 'increasing'
    elif stock_history[-1] == stock_history[-2]:
        return 'stable'
    else:
        return 'decreasing'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by cooperating to build a sustainable resource base.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: By adjusting thresholds based on remaining rounds, the strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains. Higher thresholds when many rounds remain encourage cooperation for sustainability, while lower thresholds in later rounds allow more defection if necessary.
- **Stock Monitoring**: The strategy monitors stock trends to decide actions dynamically. If the stock is stable or increasing, it continues cooperating; if decreasing, it switches to defecting.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: In early rounds, cooperation is prioritized to build a sustainable resource. As rounds progress, especially in later stages, the strategy becomes more willing to defect if the stock is low.

This approach ensures that the strategy adapts effectively to different game states, balancing between maintaining sustainability and maximizing immediate gains when necessary.

description_COLLECTIVE_319 = '''
**Strategy Name**: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

**Objective**: Maximize individual payoffs while maintaining sustainable use of the common pool resource through adaptive cooperation and defection based on current stock levels and historical cooperation rates.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start and signal willingness to maintain mutual benefits.
2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - If the current stock is above 80% of capacity (0.8 * capacity), Cooperate to preserve resource sustainability.
   - If the current stock is below 20% of capacity (0.2 * capacity), Defect to maximize immediate payoff before potential collapse.
   - For stock levels between 20% and 80%:
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate (`avg_coop`) from previous rounds across all players.
     - If `avg_coop` > 70%, Cooperate, as others are maintaining a cooperative stance.
     - If `avg_coop` < 30%, Defect, as widespread defection indicates exploitation is occurring.
     - Otherwise (30% ≤ avg_coop ≤ 70%), default to Cooperate to encourage continued sustainability.
3. **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds for resource recovery.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to set a cooperative precedent and maintain high initial stock levels.
- **Last Round**: Always Defect to capitalize on the remaining stock without concern for future depletion.
- **Stock at Thresholds (0.8* or 0.2*capacity)**: 
  - If stock ≥ 0.8 * capacity, Cooperate.
  - If stock < 0.2 * capacity, Defect.

---

### **Collective Mindset Alignment**

ATC aligns with a collective mindset by initially promoting cooperation to sustain the resource. It adaptively adjusts based on others' behaviors, aiming for mutual benefit while protecting against exploitation. The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging other players to Cooperate through reciprocal actions.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, current_round, total_rounds):
    n = number_of_players  # Given parameter
    capacity = given_capacity  # Given parameter
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if stock >= 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif stock < 0.2 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Calculate average cooperation rate from history
            avg_coop = calculate_avg_cooperation(history)
            if avg_coop > 0.7:
                return 'C'
            elif avg_coop < 0.3:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'

def calculate_avg_cooperation(history):
    # Calculate the average proportion of Cooperators in previous rounds
    total_coop = 0
    total_actions = 0
    for round_data in history:
       coop_count = sum(1 for action in round_data if action == 'C')
        total_coop += coop_count
        total_actions += len(round_data)
    if total_actions == 0:
        return 1.0  # Default to Cooperate if no history
    avg_coop = total_coop / (total_actions * n)  # Assuming each round has n actions
    return avg_coop
```

---

### **Explanation**

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts by Cooperating to maintain high stock levels and encourage others to do the same.
- **Threshold-Based Decisions**: Uses fixed thresholds (80% and 20%) of capacity to determine when to Cooperate or Defect based on current resource availability.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Adjusts decisions in middle rounds based on historical cooperation rates, promoting mutual sustainability when others Cooperate and defecting when exploitation is prevalent.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while encouraging collective resource preservation.

The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Memory (ATTM) strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation while adapting to others' behaviors and the state of the resource. Here's a structured summary of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Memory (ATTM)

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to maintain a high stock level for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the cooperation rate of other players in the previous round.
   - Use this rate to decide your action:
     - If the cooperation rate is above an 80% threshold, cooperate.
     - Below this threshold, defect to retaliate or protect against resource depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Consider defecting to maximize immediate payoff, but balance with potential collective outcomes if cooperation yields higher total payoffs.

4. **Stock Level Adjustment:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If the stock is below 50% of capacity, consider defecting more frequently to exploit remaining resources before depletion.

### Decision Rules:

- **Cooperation Threshold (80%):** Encourages maintaining cooperation when prevalent among others.
- **Memory Mechanism:** Retaliates against past defections to incentivize future cooperation.
- **Stock Level Consideration:** Adjusts behavior based on resource health, promoting caution or exploitation as needed.

### Edge Cases and Considerations:

- **First Round:** No history; cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Round:** Balance between defecting for immediate gain and cooperating if collective benefits outweigh short-term gains.
- **Stock Health:** Low stock levels trigger more cautious or aggressive behaviors, depending on sustainability needs versus exploitation opportunities.

### Implementation Summary:

The ATTM strategy dynamically adapts based on historical cooperation rates and current resource conditions. It promotes cooperation when others do so, defects to punish defectors, and adjusts behavior in response to the stock level. This balance helps sustain cooperation while defending against exploitation, making it robust for a variety of opponent behaviors.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock):
    if history is None:
        return 'C'  # First round
    
    other_cooperations = count(history['other_actions'], 'C')
    n_players = len(history['other_actions']) + 1
    cooperation_rate = other_cooperations / n_players

    if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
        threshold = 0.7
    else:
        threshold = 0.8
    
    if cooperation_rate > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def get_action(round_number, history=None, stock_level=capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return decide_action(None, capacity)
    else:
        return decide_action(history, stock_level)
```

This strategy ensures adaptability and robustness in a dynamic game setting, encouraging cooperation while protecting against resource depletion through defection when necessary.

description_COLLECTIVE_321 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation and defection based on current stock levels and historical trends. This approach ensures adaptability to various opponent behaviors while maintaining robustness.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set an initial Cooperation Threshold (CT) at 70% of the capacity.
   - Define a period for the last few rounds, where defection is prioritized.

2. **Decision Rules per Round:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to maintain a high stock level and encourage sustainability.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Defect to maximize immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.
   - **Intermediate Rounds:** Use CT to decide between cooperation or defection based on the current stock.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment of CT:**
   - Adjust CT after each round based on whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable relative to historical trends.
   - Lower CT if the stock decreases significantly, prompting more defection.
   - Maintain or slightly increase CT if the stock remains stable or grows, encouraging continued cooperation.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
Initialize:
    n = number of players
    r = number of rounds
    capacity = maximum sustainable stock level
    last_few_rounds = max(1, floor(r / 5))  # Adjust as needed

    CT = 0.7 * capacity
    recent_stock_history = deque(maxlen=5)  # Track past few stock levels
    recent_consumption_history = deque(maxlen=5)  # Track total consumption per round

For each round t in 1 to r:
    S = current_stock()
    
    if t == 1:
        action = 'C'
    elif t > (r - last_few_rounds):
        action = 'D'
    else:
        if S > CT:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'
    
    # Record action and update histories
    recent_stock_history.append(S)
    # After all players have acted, record total consumption for this round
    # Note: This would be done in the game's processing after actions are chosen
    
After each round:
    if t > 1:  # Exclude first round as there was no prior history
        # Update CT based on recent trends
        avg_stock = mean(recent_stock_history)
        total_consumption = sum(recent_consumption_history)
        
        if len(recent_stock_history) >=2 and S < recent_stock_history[-2]:
            # Stock decreased compared to previous round
            CT *= 0.95  # Lower the threshold slightly
        else:
            # Stock stable or increasing; maintain or increase CT
            CT = min(CT + (capacity - CT)*0.1, capacity)
    
    # Keep CT within reasonable bounds
    CT = max(capacity * 0.3, CT)  # Minimum cooperation level

Return action for this round
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization:** The strategy starts with a high CT to promote sustainable resource use.
- **First Round Cooperation:** Encourages others to cooperate by maintaining a high stock.
- **Dynamic CT Adjustment:** Responds to changes in the stock, adapting to increased defection or cooperation from others.
- **Defection in Final Rounds:** Maximizes immediate gains without regard for future depletion.

This approach ensures adaptability and robustness, effectively balancing between cooperation and defection based on observed outcomes.

To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a strategy where all players consistently cooperate. This ensures that the resource remains stable and provides a steady income for everyone involved.

**Answer:**

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate in every round}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_323 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing resource exploitation and preservation among multiple players, we propose a dynamic strategy that adjusts cooperation levels based on observed changes in the resource stock. Here's a concise step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Each player starts with an initial cooperation threshold set to half of the maximum capacity (threshold_i = capacity / 2).
   - In the first round, all players cooperate since the initial stock is at its maximum.

2. **Decision Making in Each Round:**
   a. Observe the current stock level.
   b. If the current stock is above their cooperation threshold, the player cooperates (C); otherwise, they defect (D).

3. **Adjusting Thresholds Dynamically:**
   a. After each round, compute the change in stock (ΔS).
   b. Use a moving average of ΔS over recent rounds to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
   c. If the moving average is positive, increase the cooperation threshold; if negative, decrease it.
   d. Implement safeguards to prevent thresholds from dropping too low when the stock is critically depleted.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to sustainably start resource utilization.
   - **Low Stock Trap:** If the stock remains below a critical level for several rounds, reset thresholds higher to encourage cooperation and resource recovery.

**Final Strategy:**

Each player employs a dynamic cooperation threshold strategy that adapts based on observed changes in the resource stock. By balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, players prevent resource depletion while optimizing their exploitation of shared resources.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is for each player to dynamically adjust their cooperation level based on the current stock and historical trends. They use a moving average of stock changes to update their thresholds, ensuring sustainable resource management. The final answer is:

description_COLLECTIVE_324 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting decisions based on the current state of the common pool. The strategy uses thresholds and trends to decide between cooperation and defection, ensuring adaptability across various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Description:

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** When the stock is above 80% of capacity or when the stock has been increasing in recent rounds.
   - **Defect (D):** When the stock is below 60% of capacity or when the stock has been decreasing in recent rounds.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to maintain a higher initial stock for future sustainability.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.
   - **Very Low Stock (below 10% of capacity):** Defect to salvage any remaining resource before depletion.

3. **Adaptation Based on Trends:**
   - Between the thresholds of 60% and 80% capacity, adjust decisions based on whether the stock has been increasing or decreasing in recent rounds (considering up to two previous rounds).

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(history, current_round, r, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    
    stock_history = extract_stock_levels(history)
    current_stock = latest(stock_history)
    
    lower_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    upper_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > upper_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < lower_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Determine trend based on available history
        if len(stock_history) >=2:
            previous_stock = stock_history[-2]
            if current_stock > previous_stock:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            # Not enough history; default to Cooperate
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Thresholds:** The strategy uses 60% and 80% of capacity as thresholds. Cooperation is encouraged when the stock is healthy (above 80%) or improving within this range, while defection is favored when the stock is stressed (below 60%) or declining.
  
- **Trend Analysis:** Between the thresholds, the strategy checks recent stock trends to decide actions. If the stock has increased in the last available rounds, cooperation continues; if it has decreased, defection is chosen.

- **Edge Cases:** The strategy handles the first round by cooperating and the last round by defecting, ensuring a balance between long-term sustainability and immediate payoff optimization.

This approach ensures adaptability and responsiveness to changing conditions, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defection when necessary to optimize both individual gains and resource sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_325 = '''
**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Players will initially Cooperate in the first round to encourage sustainable resource use.
   - In subsequent rounds:
     - If the current stock is below 70% of the capacity, players switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.
     - If more than 25% of other players Defected in the previous round, players will also Defect this round as a form of retaliation or protection.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to start positively and encourage others to do the same.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** Use the above conditions dynamically. If stock recovers above 70%, revert to Cooperating if defection rates are low.

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   - Aim for mutual cooperation while incorporating mechanisms to respond to defection, preventing it from spiraling out of control.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def strategy(player_index, history, current_stock, capacity):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check stock level
    stock_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    if current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate defection rate from previous rounds
    recent_rounds = history[-1]  # Assuming history stores each round's actions
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in recent_rounds if action == 'D')
    defection_rate = num_defectors / len(recent_rounds)
    
    if defection_rate > 0.25:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

This strategy balances cooperation with necessary adjustments based on observed behavior and resource levels, aiming to sustain the common pool while deterring excessive exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_326 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation for sustainable resource use with defecting for immediate gain, we propose an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts based on the current state of the shared resource. This approach ensures cooperation when the resource is healthy and shifts to defection if the resource shows signs of depletion.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating when the resource level (stock) is above a certain threshold, which we set as 75% of the maximum capacity (`T0`).
2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Continuously monitor the stock levels over recent rounds. If the average stock is decreasing, lower the cooperation threshold to encourage more defecting. Conversely, if the stock remains stable or increases, raise the threshold towards `T0` to promote cooperation.
3. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Each round, decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock relative to the adjusted threshold.

This strategy allows for adaptability, ensuring that cooperation is maintained when sustainable and switching to defection when necessary to maximize immediate gains without causing irreversible resource depletion.

### Solution Code
```python
from collections import deque

def determine_action(current_stock, capacity, previous_stocks):
    # Parameters
    T0 = 0.75 * capacity
    m = 3                 # Number of past rounds to consider for adjustment
    delta = 0.1           # Amount to adjust threshold each time
    
    # Initialize recent_stocks with the given previous_stocks (assuming they are in order)
    recent_stocks = deque(previous_stocks, maxlen=m)
    
    # Update recent_stocks with current_stock if there's enough history
    if len(recent_stocks) >= m:
        average_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
        previous_average = sum(recent_stocks[:-1]) / (len(recent_stocks[:-1]) or 1)
        
        if average_stock < previous_average:
            # Stock is decreasing; lower threshold
            current_threshold = max(T0 - delta * capacity, 0.5 * capacity)
        else:
            # Stock is stable or increasing; raise threshold towards T0
            current_threshold = min(T0 + delta * capacity, capacity)
    else:
        # Not enough history to adjust threshold yet
        current_threshold = T0
    
    # Determine action based on current_stock and current_threshold
    if current_stock > current_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage
capacity = 100
current_stock = 100
previous_stocks = [100, 95, 90]  # Simulated previous stock levels

action = determine_action(current_stock, capacity, previous_stocks)
print(f"Action: {action}")  # Output will be 'D' or another based on the current state
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by cooperating when the stock is above `T0` (75% of capacity), promoting sustainable use.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: By monitoring recent stock levels, the strategy adjusts the threshold. If stocks are declining, it lowers the threshold to encourage defecting; if stable or rising, it raises the threshold to promote cooperation.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Each decision is based on the current stock relative to an adjusted threshold, ensuring adaptability to changing conditions.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, allowing for robust performance against various player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_327 = '''
The strategy is designed to adaptively manage cooperation and defection based on the current state of the common pool stock. It balances sustainability with maximizing immediate gains, especially as the game progresses towards its end.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation-Defection**

1. **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage sustainable resource use and prevent rapid depletion.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (Except Last):**
   - If the current stock is above a threshold (set at half of capacity), cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - If below this threshold, defect to maximize immediate payoff as the resource may be overused by others.
3. **Last Round:** Defect to take as much as possible since there's no future payoff.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'  # Defect in the last round
    else:
        threshold = capacity / 2
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate if stock is above the threshold
        else:
            return 'D'  # Defect otherwise
```

**Explanation:**

- **First Round:** By starting with cooperation, the strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment and prevent immediate resource depletion.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:** The decision to cooperate or defect depends on whether the current stock level is above half of capacity. Cooperating when the stock is sufficient ensures sustainable use, allowing the resource to replenish adequately for future rounds. Defecting when below the threshold responds to potential overuse by others, ensuring maximum immediate payoff.

- **Last Round:** Since there are no future rounds left, defecting maximizes the final payoff without concern for depleting resources for subsequent (non-existent) rounds.

This strategy is robust and adapts dynamically based on observed stock levels, making it effective against a variety of opponent behaviors.

**Final Answer: Balanced Harvest Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The Balanced Harvest (BH) strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff in the Common Pool Resource Game by balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It adapts dynamically based on the current state of the resource and historical data, encouraging cooperation when possible and signaling resource threats through defection.

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Round:** Cooperate to encourage others to do the same.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Calculate expected stock replenishment assuming all players Cooperated.
  - Compare actual stock change with this expectation.
  - If the stock decreases more than expected (indicating possible defection), Defect to signal the issue.
  - Cooperate if the resource is healthy and remains stable.

**2. Thresholds:**
- **Cooperate:** When the current stock is above 80% of capacity or recent changes are within expected bounds under cooperation.
- **Defect:** If the stock falls below expected levels, indicating over-exploitation.

**3. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Start with Cooperate to set a positive tone.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Adjust thresholds to be stricter, reducing tolerance for defection and signaling resource stress.

**4. Adaptability:**
- BH dynamically adjusts based on observed stock changes, encouraging others to Cooperate when the resource is healthy and defecting to signal threats when it's over-exploited.

This strategy ensures a balance between individual gains and collective resource management, making it robust against various opponent behaviors in the tournament setting.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_329 = '''
**Final Answer: Sustainable Harvest Strategy**

The strategy aims to maintain a sustainable level of resource consumption by encouraging cooperation and adapting to defectors' actions. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with cooperation in the first round to maintain the stock at its capacity.

2. **Monitor Consumption**: After each round, calculate the total consumption based on observed player actions. This helps determine if the current consumption rate is sustainable.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - If the expected total consumption is below 0.5 * capacity (a sustainable level), continue cooperating.
   - If it exceeds this threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains and prevent resource collapse.

4. **Adaptation in Later Rounds**: In the last few rounds, defect to exploit remaining resources without worrying about future sustainability.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
for each player i:
    history = []

for each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action_i = 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate expected_total_consumption based on previous rounds' actions
        # For simplicity, use the average consumption of past rounds

```

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round**: All players start by cooperating.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of rounds)**: Switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains.
- **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock drops below a certain threshold, defect to exploit remaining resources.

**Rationale:**

The strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability. By cooperating initially and adapting based on others' actions, it encourages cooperation while allowing players to respond to defectors by maximizing their payoffs when necessary. This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors and promotes long-term resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_330 = '''
To address the problem of determining when to cooperate or defect in repeated interactions with other players, we propose a strategy that balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains. The strategy is designed to adapt based on current conditions and past behaviors.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first round, default to cooperation to encourage mutual long-term benefits.
   
2. **Adaptive Play in Subsequent Rounds**:
   a. **Check for Final Rounds**: If the current round is among the last 10% of total rounds (rounded up), defect to maximize immediate payoffs with no regard for future consequences.
   
   b. **Assess Stock Level**: Evaluate if the current stock exceeds 75% of its maximum capacity. If not, defect to prioritize short-term gains as the resource is too depleted for sustainable cooperation.
   
   c. **Evaluate Previous Cooperation Rates**: Calculate the percentage of players who cooperated in the immediately preceding round. If this rate is above 60%, cooperate again; otherwise, defect.

3. **Defection Thresholds**:
   - Use a combination of stock level and previous cooperation rates to decide whether to continue cooperating or switch to defection.

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent, hoping others will reciprocate, leading to sustainable payoffs.
  
- **Final Rounds Handling**: In the final 10% of rounds, defecting is optimal as there's no future payoff to consider. This maximizes immediate gains.

- **Stock Level Check**: By ensuring the stock remains above 75%, the strategy maintains a threshold for sustainability. If the resource drops below this level, cooperation becomes less viable, prompting defection.

- **Previous Cooperation Rate**: Monitoring others' past actions helps adapt the strategy dynamically. If a significant majority (60%) cooperated previously, continuing to cooperate is beneficial. Otherwise, defecting maximizes individual gain given others' behavior.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Determine the total number of rounds (`total_rounds`).
   - Calculate `k`, the threshold for final rounds: `k = ceil(total_rounds * 0.1)`.
   
2. **Round-Specific Decisions**:
   a. For each round from 2 to `total_rounds - k + 1`:
      i. Check if current stock > 75% of capacity.
      ii. Determine the percentage of players who cooperated in the previous round.
      iii. If both conditions are met, cooperate; else, defect.
   
   b. For rounds within the last `k`, always defect.

### Conclusion:

This strategy adapts to changing conditions by considering both resource levels and others' cooperation rates. It balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, ensuring optimal payoffs while encouraging mutual cooperation when feasible.

The collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to encourage cooperation while adapting to changes in resource levels and player behavior. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first round to maintain a sustainable stock level.
2. **Endgame Defection**: Switch to defection in the last few rounds to maximize immediate payoffs as there are no future repercussions.
3. **Resource Threshold Check**: Cooperate only if the current stock is above 50% of capacity; otherwise, defect to prevent resource collapse.
4. **Cooperation Rate Monitoring**: Continue cooperating if a majority (e.g., >60%) of players have cooperated in recent rounds; defect if cooperation drops below this threshold.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, cooperation_history):
    capacity =  # Given as part of the problem setup
    r =          # Total number of rounds
    k = 3        # Number of last rounds to defect
    X = 60       # Minimum cooperation percentage to continue cooperating
    m = 3        # Number of recent rounds to consider for cooperation rate

    if round_number == 1:
        return Cooperate
    elif round_number > r - k:  # Near the end of the game
        return Defect
    else:
        threshold = capacity / 2
        if current_stock < threshold:
            return Defect
        else:
            recent_coop = cooperation_history[-m:]  # Last m rounds' cooperation data
            coop_rate = (sum(recent_coop) / len(recent_coop)) * 100
            if coop_rate > X:
                return Cooperate
            else:
                return Defect
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Round**: Starts with cooperation to sustain the resource.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Switches to defection in the last few rounds to exploit remaining resources without regard for future sustainability.
- **Resource Check**: Maintains cooperation if the stock remains above half capacity, ensuring sustainable growth. Defects if the stock drops below this threshold to avoid further depletion.
- **Cooperation Monitoring**: Encourages continued cooperation when a majority of players do so, fostering a cooperative environment. Switches to defection if cooperation rates fall, preventing exploitation by defectors.

This strategy balances sustainability with self-interest, adapting dynamically based on observable state and historical player behavior.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_332 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment**

1. **Initial Phase (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Encourage a sustainable start by assuming others will also cooperate.

2. **Monitoring Excess Consumption (EC):**
   - After each round, calculate EC as total consumption minus the amount if everyone cooperated.
   - Track EC over recent rounds to identify trends of defectors.

3. **Switching to Defection:**
   - If EC exceeds a threshold for k consecutive rounds:
     - Switch to defecting for x rounds to punish defectors and incentivize cooperation.

4. **Defection Phase Adjustments:**
   - During defection, monitor EC.
   - If EC drops below the threshold before x rounds, revert to cooperation early.

5. **Recovery and Reassessment:**
   - After reverting, reassess based on new EC trends and stock health.
   - Prioritize cooperation if the stock is low to allow recovery.

6. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3):**
   - Focus on cooperation to maximize payoffs without worrying about future retaliation.

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- **First Round:** Default to cooperation to build trust.
- **Low Stock:** Prioritize cooperation to aid recovery, regardless of defectors.

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, encouraging mutual cooperation through adaptive responses and implicit coordination.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_333 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

The strategy is designed to promote sustainable use of the common pool resource by balancing individual gains against collective well-being. It adapts based on observed behavior and current stock levels.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds:** Start by Cooperating to foster a cooperative environment and observe others' actions.

2. **Stock Thresholds:**
   - **High Threshold (H):** 90% of capacity.
     - If the stock is above H, Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - **Low Threshold (L):** 50% of capacity.
     - If the stock is below L, Cooperate to conserve and allow regrowth.

3. **Middle Range (L < Stock ≤ H):**
   - If most players (≥60%) Cooperated in the last round, continue Cooperating.
   - Otherwise, Defect to signal or respond to others' strategies, encouraging them to cooperate more.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
   - For the last round (if known), assess recent behavior:
     - If most are Defecting, also Defect; else, Cooperate.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock, history, n, capacity):
    H = 0.9 * capacity
    L = 0.5 * capacity

    if not history:  # First round
        return 'C'
    
    last_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    cooperators = sum(1 for a in last_actions if a == 'C')
    defectors = n - cooperators

    if stock > H:
        return 'C'
    elif L < stock <= H:
        # Cooperate if most players did, else Defect
        if cooperators / n >= 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Stock ≤ L
        return 'C'

    # Additional logic for last round (if known)
    if current_round == r:
        if defectors / n > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Rationale:

- The strategy begins with Cooperation to build trust and assess others' behavior.
- By using stock thresholds, it ensures the resource is sustainably managed, avoiding depletion when possible.
- Adaptive responses based on recent actions encourage mutual cooperation while addressing exploitation by Defectors.
- Handling edge cases like the first and last rounds ensures robustness across game dynamics.

This approach aims to maximize collective payoffs over time by fostering a balance between individual gain and communal resource preservation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_334 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect based on the current state of the resource, we can employ a strategy that balances immediate gains with sustainability. The approach involves observing trends in the resource level and adjusting actions accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Observe the Current Resource Level (S_current):** Check the current stock of the resource relative to its capacity.

2. **Determine Sustainability Threshold:** Establish a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) above which Cooperating is beneficial as it maintains or grows the resource.

3. **Analyze Recent Trends:**
   - Compare the current resource level with that of the previous round.
   - If the stock has increased, it suggests others are Cooperating; continue Cooperating to sustain growth.
   - If the stock has decreased, it indicates potential Defectors; switch to Defecting for higher immediate payoff.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - **Cooperate** if:
     - The current stock is above the sustainability threshold.
     - The resource level increased in the previous round.
   - **Defect** otherwise.

This strategy adapts to the behavior of others, promoting Cooperation when sustainable and switching to Defection when necessary to prevent resource depletion.

### Final Answer:

To decide whether to Cooperate or Defect based on the current state of the resource, follow this strategy:

1. If the current stock level is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) **and** the stock has increased in the previous round, **Cooperate.**
2. Otherwise, **Defect.**

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to observed trends in resource levels.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock is above threshold and increasing; otherwise, Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_335 = '''
To determine the Nash equilibrium in this scenario, we analyze the strategies available to each player and their payoffs. A Nash equilibrium occurs when no player can benefit by changing their strategy while others keep theirs unchanged.

Given that Cooperating yields a lower immediate payoff (S/(2n)) compared to Defecting (S/n), each player has an incentive to Defect to maximize their own gain, assuming others might Cooperate. However, if everyone defects, the stock depletes entirely, leading to a payoff of zero for all in subsequent rounds.

In this setup, the dominant strategy for each player is to Defect because it provides a higher immediate payoff regardless of others' actions. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is for all players to defect, resulting in the stock being fully depleted and no player receiving any payoff beyond that round.

**Answer:**

The Nash equilibrium occurs when every player chooses to defect. In this case, the entire common resource is taken, leaving nothing for future rounds.

$\boxed{\text{All players choose to Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_336 = '''
The AI's decision-making process is designed to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability by considering both the current state of the resource and the cooperative tendencies of other players. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: The AI starts by Cooperating in the first round, recognizing that beginning with maximum stock provides an opportunity for all players to sustain the resource.

2. **Monitoring Trends**: For each subsequent round, the AI calculates the moving average of cooperation rates from recent rounds. This helps gauge whether other players are predominantly Cooperating or Defecting.

3. **Stock Threshold Check**: The AI checks if the current stock level is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity). This threshold ensures that Cooperating won't deplete the resource beyond recovery.

4. **Cooperation Decision**: If both conditions are met—sufficient stock and a high enough average cooperation rate—the AI decides to Cooperate, contributing to sustainable resource management.

5. **Defection Trigger**: If either condition isn't met (stock is too low or others are defecting), the AI defects to maximize immediate gains, preventing being exploited by others' actions.

This strategy adaptively responds to the game's dynamics, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to optimize outcomes.

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on the current stock and historical player behavior.

---

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 25%):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Reasoning:** Establish a stable baseline and observe opponents' strategies.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Stock Health Check:**
     - If stock is above 75% of capacity, assess opponent behavior.
     - If stock is below 75%, switch to Cooperate (C) to aid replenishment.
   - **Opponent Behavior Assessment:**
     - Calculate the proportion of Defectors in recent rounds. If over 40%, consider defecting (D); otherwise, cooperate.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 25%):**
   - **High Stock (>75% capacity):** Defect (D) to maximize payoff.
   - **Low Stock:** Cooperate (C) to encourage potential growth before the game ends.

    if round_number > 0.75 * total_rounds:
        if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
            return 'D'  # Defect to maximize payoff in last few rounds

    if current_stock < 0.75 * capacity:

    recent_defectors = count_defectors(history, last_n=5)
    defector_proportion = recent_defectors / n_players
    
    if defector_proportion > 0.4:
        return 'D'  # Defect if many are defecting

            if player_action == 'D':
                total_defectors += 1
    return total_defectors
```

---

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to maintain a healthy stock.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Adjust based on current stock; defect if high, cooperate if low.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Cooperate to sustain resources for future rounds.
- **Low Stock:** Cooperate to encourage replenishment and avoid further depletion.

description_COLLECTIVE_338 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set a threshold at 50% of the initial capacity (e.g., if capacity is 100 units, threshold is 50).
   - Note the total number of rounds (r).

2. **Round 1:**
   - Since it's the first round and stock is at full capacity, choose to Cooperate.

3. **Subsequent Rounds (from 2 to r-1):**
   - After each round, observe the current stock level.
   - If the stock is above or equal to the threshold (50 units in our example), continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock drops below the threshold, switch to Defecting.

4. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Regardless of the stock level, choose to Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

5. **Adaptation:**
   - By monitoring the stock level and switching strategies based on whether it's above or below the threshold, the strategy adapts to the behavior of other players.
   - If many players are defecting, causing rapid depletion, the strategy detects this by the stock dropping below 50% and responds by also defecting.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is:

- Cooperate in the first round when the stock is at its maximum capacity.
- In each subsequent round, cooperate if the current stock level is above 50% of the initial capacity; otherwise, defect.
- Always defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletions.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when the stock is above 50% of its capacity, otherwise defect. Defect in the last round regardless of the stock level.}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_339 = '''
To address the problem of sustainable resource use while balancing individual gain, we propose a decision-making strategy based on the current stock level. This strategy aims to maintain or recover the resource when it's healthy and switches to maximizing immediate benefits when the resource is depleted.

### Strategy:

1. **Cooperate When Stock is Healthy:**
   - If the current stock \( S \) is greater than or equal to half of the capacity (\( C/2 \)), players should choose to Cooperate. This supports sustainable use, ensuring that the resource remains viable for future rounds.
   
2. **Defect When Stock is Depleted:**
   - If the current stock \( S \) drops below \( C/2 \), players should switch to Defecting. This action maximizes their immediate payoff, recognizing that the resource may not recover sufficiently in subsequent rounds.

3. **Final Round Exception:**
   - In the last round (\( t = r \)), all players should always choose to Defect. Since there are no future consequences, maximizing individual payoff is the optimal choice.

### Rationale:

- **Sustainability When Healthy:** Cooperating when \( S \geq C/2 \) ensures that consumption does not deplete the resource beyond its ability to recover. This maintains a stable stock level over time.
  
- **Maximizing Payoff When Depleted:** Defecting when \( S < C/2 \) allows players to secure higher immediate payoffs, acknowledging that the resource may be nearing depletion and future recovery is uncertain.

- **Last Round Optimization:** In the final round, defecting ensures players maximize their payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Example Application:

- **Initial Healthy Stock (\( S = 100 \), \( C = 100 \)):**
  - Since \( S \geq 50 \), all Cooperate. Each player receives \( 12.5 \) units, total consumption is \( 50 \), leaving \( 50 \). Growth restores the stock to \( 100 \) in the next round.

- **Stock Depletion (\( S = 62.5 \)):**
  - Players may start defecting if they anticipate future depletion. This could lead to further drops, emphasizing the need for careful monitoring and adaptation.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_340 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining cooperation among players to sustain a shared resource while allowing for defection when beneficial, we propose a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term resource health. This strategy is designed to encourage mutual cooperation when conditions are favorable and adapt by defecting when necessary.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Few Rounds):**
   - In the first two rounds, all players should Cooperate unconditionally.
     - Rationale: Establishes a baseline of sustainability and prevents early resource depletion, allowing the stock to remain stable as it grows back after each round of consumption.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision-Making (From Round 3 Onwards):**
   - For each subsequent round until the penultimate one:
     - Check if the current stock is above 50% of its capacity.
     - Assess whether at least 60% of other players Cooperated in the previous round.
     - **If both conditions are met:** Cooperate to sustain the resource and maintain mutual benefits.
     - **Otherwise:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, especially if cooperation is failing or the resource is strained.

3. **Defection in the Last Round:**
   - In the final round (round r), all players should Defect.
     - Rationale: Since there are no future rounds to benefit from sustainability, maximizing immediate payoff is prioritized.

### Detailed Decision Rules:

1. **For Rounds 1 and 2:**
   - Always Cooperate, regardless of other players' actions or the current stock level.

2. **For Rounds 3 to r-1:**
   - If:
     - The current stock (S_t) is greater than or equal to 50% of capacity.
     - In the previous round (t-1), at least 60% of other players Cooperated.
     - Then, Cooperate in the current round.
   - Else:
     - Defect.

3. **For Round r:**
   - Always Defect to maximize the final payoff without concern for future consequences.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, the resource remains stable and grows back each cycle, encouraging others to continue cooperating as they observe sustainable behavior.
  
- **Threshold-Based Adaptation:** This mechanism ensures that cooperation continues only when both the resource is healthy and a sufficient number of players are also cooperating. If either condition fails (e.g., due to defectors reducing cooperation rates or excessive consumption lowering the stock), players switch to defecting to protect their immediate payoffs.

- **Final Round Defection:** Recognizing that there’s no future payoff after the last round, defecting ensures players maximize their final gains without worrying about depleting a resource that won't matter afterward.

This strategy effectively balances between maintaining cooperation for long-term benefits and defecting when it becomes advantageous or necessary, ensuring a sustainable approach while adapting to changing conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_341 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed a strategic approach that balances cooperation for long-term resource sustainability with defection to maximize short-term gains. Here's how you can apply this strategy:

### Approach
1. **Early Rounds (Cooperation Phase):** Start by cooperating in the initial rounds to establish a baseline and encourage others to maintain the resource.
2. **Middle Rounds (Adaptive Phase):** Monitor the stock trends. If the average stock drops below a threshold or shows significant decline, switch to defecting to maximize individual gain.
3. **Late Rounds (Defection Phase):** As the game nears its end, prioritize defection to secure maximum immediate payoff, knowing future rounds are limited.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock_history, capacity):
    # Early rounds: Cooperate
    early_rounds = min(3, total_rounds // 5)
    if current_round <= early_rounds:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # Late rounds: Defect
    late_start = max(total_rounds - (total_rounds // 5), 1)  # Last 20%
    if current_round >= late_start:
        return 'Defect'
    
    # Calculate threshold dynamically
    initial_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    decay_factor = 0.2 * capacity / total_rounds
    threshold = max(initial_threshold - decay_factor * (current_round), capacity * 0.5)
    
    # Consider recent stock trend
    window_size = min(5, len(stock_history))
    recent_stocks = stock_history[-window_size:]
    average_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
    
    # Check if stock is below threshold or showing a significant decrease
    if average_stock < threshold:
        return 'Defect'
    else:
        return 'Cooperate'

# Example usage:
capacity = 100
total_rounds = 20
stock_history = [100, 98, 95, 90, 88]  # Simulated stock levels

for t in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    action = determine_action(t, total_rounds, stock_history[:t-1], capacity)
    print(f"Round {t}: Action is {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **Early Rounds:** The strategy begins by cooperating to build a sustainable resource base.
- **Middle Rounds:** By analyzing the stock trend over recent rounds, the strategy adapts. If the stock drops below a dynamically adjusted threshold or shows significant decline, it defects to maximize gains.
- **Late Rounds:** As the game nears its end, the focus shifts to defecting to secure maximum immediate payoff, considering future rounds are limited.

This approach ensures a balance between maintaining sustainability and maximizing individual gain based on observed trends and game progression.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_342 = '''
To effectively address the challenge of balancing individual payoff with collective sustainability in a dynamic game environment, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Round**: Begin by Cooperating to establish a sustainable stock level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Monitor the proportion of Defectors (D_rate) from the previous round and the current Stock Ratio (S_ratio = Current Stock / Capacity).
   - Use dynamic thresholds based on these metrics to decide between Cooperating or Defecting.
3. **Edge Cases**: Adjust behavior in the final rounds and when stock levels are critically low.

### Detailed Decision Rules

1. **First Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate.
   - **Rationale**: Starting with Cooperation helps maintain a stable stock level, fostering a sustainable environment for subsequent rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   a. **Calculate D_rate and S_ratio**:
      - **D_rate**: Proportion of players who Defected in the last round.
      - **S_ratio**: Current Stock divided by Maximum Capacity.

   b. **Decision Logic**:
      - If **S_ratio < 50%**:
        - **Action**: Cooperate.
        - **Rationale**: Low stock levels necessitate cooperation to allow growth and prevent further depletion.
      - Else if **D_rate > 70%**:
        - **Action**: Defect for the next few rounds or until D_rate decreases.
        - **Rationale**: High Defector rates indicate potential stock crash, prompting immediate payoff maximization.
      - Else:
        - If **S_ratio > 75% and D_rate < 30%**:
          - **Action**: Cooperate.
          - **Rationale**: Stable conditions support cooperation for sustainable payoffs.
        - If **50% < S_ratio ≤75% and D_rate < 50%**:
          - **Action**: Cooperate.
          - **Rationale**: Moderate stock levels with controlled Defector rates allow continued sustainability efforts.
        - Else:
          - **Action**: Defect.
          - **Rationale**: Higher risk of stock depletion or exploitation warrants defecting to secure immediate gains.

3. **Final X% of Rounds** (e.g., last 20%):
   - **Adjustment**: Gradually increase tendency to Defect as future rounds are limited, prioritizing immediate payoff over sustainability.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments**:
   - Periodically reassess thresholds based on observed stock recovery trends and player behavior patterns.
   - Incorporate a moving average of D_rate to reduce volatility in decisions.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Threshold Flexibility**: Adjust the thresholds (e.g., 50%, 70%) based on game-specific parameters or observed outcomes to optimize performance.
- **Stock Monitoring**: Continuously track stock levels and recovery trends to inform dynamic adjustments.
- **Player Behavior Analysis**: Use historical data on player actions to refine decision-making, enhancing adaptability.

This strategy balances individual payoff maximization with collective sustainability by dynamically responding to changing conditions, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_343 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on the current state of the common pool. The strategy is designed to be adaptive, ensuring sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Overview

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Cooperate if the current stock exceeds 75% of capacity (Upper Threshold):**
   - When the stock is above this threshold, cooperation ensures sustainable resource levels and mutual benefits for all players.
   
2. **Defect if the current stock falls below 50% of capacity (Lower Threshold):**
   - Below this threshold, defecting provides higher immediate payoffs while accounting for potential future depletions.

3. **Middle Range Strategy (50% to 75% of Capacity):**
   - Observe the cooperation rate from the previous round.
     - If more than half of the players cooperated, continue to cooperate.
     - Otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff while considering potential future adjustments.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate, as starting with a high stock level encourages mutual sustainability.
- **Rounds Near Depletion:** If the stock approaches critically low levels (below 50%), prioritize defecting to secure higher individual payoffs before potential resource exhaustion.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, n_players, history):
    upper_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    lower_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > upper_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < lower_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Middle range: consider previous cooperation rate
        if history and len(history) >= 1:
            last_round_actions = history[-1]
            cooperators = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions.values() if action == 'C')
            if cooperators / n_players > 0.5:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            # No previous history, default to Cooperate
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Cooperation Threshold (75% Capacity):** By cooperating when the stock is above this level, players help maintain resource sustainability and ensure steady growth.
  
- **Defection Threshold (50% Capacity):** Below this point, defecting maximizes immediate payoffs while allowing for potential resource recovery if cooperation resumes in subsequent rounds.

- **Middle Range Adaptation:** This strategy leverages the previous round's cooperation rate to decide current actions. If a majority cooperated last round, continuing to cooperate helps sustain resources; otherwise, defecting secures higher individual gains and may prompt others to reconsider their strategies.

This approach ensures adaptability, encouraging cooperation when sustainable while strategically defecting to maximize payoffs in challenging scenarios, thus achieving a balance between collective and individual interests.

**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Approach:**
   - Begin by Cooperating (C) in the first round to promote sustainability and observe opponents' actions.

2. **Stock Health Monitoring:**
   - Define a 'healthy' stock threshold, such as 75% of capacity. If the current stock falls below this, consider switching strategies.
   - Track the trend of stock levels over rounds to assess if the resource is being sustainably managed.

3. **Opponent Behavior Analysis:**
   - Keep track of how many opponents have Defected (D) in recent rounds. If a significant number defect, respond by defecting to encourage cooperation or protect against exploitation.

4. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate** if the stock is above the healthy threshold and fewer than a certain percentage of opponents have recently defected.
   - **Defect** if the stock is below the threshold or a high number of opponents have defected in recent rounds.

5. **Adaptive Mechanisms:**
   - Implement a graduated response where cooperation continues unless specific conditions (stock health, opponent behavior) indicate a shift to defecting.
   - Include a cooldown period after defecting to allow potential recovery of cooperation among opponents.

6. **Last Round Handling:**
   - In the final round, choose to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

7. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - As rounds progress, adjust thresholds for stock health and opponent defection based on remaining rounds, allowing more flexibility in later stages.

8. **Balanced Retaliation:**
   - Use tit-for-tat logic, where defection is met with defection in subsequent rounds, to discourage sustained exploitation by opponents.

9. **Edge Case Management:**
   - If the stock is critically low (near zero), prioritize defecting to maximize immediate gains before the resource depletes entirely.

10. **Sustainability Check:**
    - Calculate expected growth and consumption to determine if continued cooperation can sustain the stock or if it will inevitably lead to depletion, necessitating a switch to defection.

**Pseudocode Implementation Outline:**

```
for each round t in 1..r:
    if t == r:
        choose D
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        healthy_threshold = capacity * 0.75
        recent_defections = count_opponent_defections_in_recent_rounds(k)
        
        if current_stock > healthy_threshold and recent_defections < defection_tolerance:
            choose C
        else:
            choose D

        // Update history for next round
        update_opponent_history()
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy begins with cooperation to encourage a sustainable resource use.
- It dynamically adjusts based on the stock's health and opponents' behavior, switching to defection when necessary to protect against over-exploitation or sustain the resource.
- By incorporating recent history and adaptive thresholds, the strategy remains robust against various opponent behaviors while promoting collective sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_345 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and the number of rounds remaining. The goal is to maintain a healthy stock for sustainable future gains while maximizing immediate payoffs toward the end of the game.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the early rounds to build or maintain a high stock level, ensuring growth potential.
2. **Dynamic Thresholding:** Use a cooperation threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity). Cooperate if the stock is below this threshold to prevent further depletion and encourage regrowth.
3. **Defection in High Stock Levels:** If the stock is above the threshold and there are enough rounds remaining, defect to maximize immediate payoffs without risking collapse.
4. **Final Round Defection:** In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%), defect to prioritize short-term gains since future rounds no longer matter.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(S_t, t, r):
    # Define thresholds as percentages of capacity
    high_threshold = 0.7
    low_threshold = 0.5
    
    # Calculate the total number of rounds for dynamic adjustments
    total_rounds = r
    early_rounds = total_rounds // 4
    late_rounds_start = max(total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10), t)  # Last 10% of rounds
    
    if S_t is None:
        # Initial round, cooperate
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if in the last few rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoffs
    if t >= late_rounds_start:
        return 'D'
    
    # Check against high threshold: defect if above and not too early
    if S_t > high_threshold * capacity:
        return 'D'
    
    # Check against low threshold: cooperate if below
    if S_t < low_threshold * capacity:
        return 'C'
    
    # Middle rounds: decide based on remaining rounds
    # If many rounds left, encourage cooperation for future growth
    if (r - t) > (total_rounds // 2):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage:
# Parameters would be defined or passed in as needed
capacity = 100  # Example capacity value
current_stock = 80  # Example current stock
round_number = 50
total_rounds = 100

action = decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds)
print(f"Action decided: {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **Cooperation Threshold:** The strategy uses a high threshold (70% of capacity) to encourage cooperation when the stock is healthy but not excessively high. This helps in maintaining or growing the stock.
- **Defection Threshold:** When the stock is above 70%, defecting is considered safe and beneficial for immediate payoffs without risking collapse.
- **Late-Round Defection:** In the final 10% of rounds, defecting maximizes short-term gains since future rounds are irrelevant.
- **Dynamic Adjustments:** The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the number of rounds remaining, ensuring cooperation in early stages to build a sustainable stock and switching to defection as the game nears its end.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, aiming to maximize overall payoffs while considering the impact of each action on future rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_346 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation and defection for optimal resource management, we propose the following strategy:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating to maintain a healthy stock level, allowing for sustainable growth over multiple rounds.

2. **Threshold Monitoring:** Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity. If the stock is above 70% of capacity, continue Cooperating to preserve and enhance future resource availability.

3. **Switch to Defection:** If the stock drops below 70%, switch to Defecting. This adjustment allows players to maximize their immediate payoffs when the resource is at risk of depletion, preventing a situation where others might exploit the remaining resource excessively.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation:** While this strategy uses a fixed threshold, it can be dynamically adjusted based on the number of rounds remaining or historical stock trends. However, for simplicity and without additional tracking variables, maintaining a consistent threshold provides a practical balance between current gains and future sustainability.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to Cooperate when the current stock exceeds 70% of capacity and Defect otherwise. This approach balances immediate payoffs with long-term resource sustainability.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock > 70% of capacity, else Defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_347 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Group Behavior**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to promote sustainability and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Before Last Few Rounds):**
   a. **Calculate Average Cooperation Rate:**
      - Compute the proportion of players who cooperated in previous rounds.
   
   b. **Assess Stock Health:**
      - Check if the current stock is above 70% of capacity and whether it's growing or stable.

   c. **Decision Logic:**
      - If both the cooperation rate exceeds 70% and the stock is healthy, continue Cooperating (C).
      - Otherwise, switch to Defecting (D) to prevent resource depletion.

3. **Last Few Rounds:**
   - Gradually increase defection tendency as rounds remaining decrease.
   - In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future sustainability.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment of Cooperation Threshold:**
   - After each round, adjust the required cooperation rate based on stock performance.
   - If the stock is low or declining, lower the threshold to encourage more defection.
   - Conversely, if the stock is robust, raise the threshold to promote continued cooperation.

5. **Smoothing Mechanisms:**
   - Use a moving average of past cooperation rates to avoid sudden shifts in strategy.
   - Adjust thresholds gradually to prevent oscillations between cooperation and defection.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decision(current_round, rounds_remaining, stock_level, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate average cooperation rate from history
    total_actions = sum(len(round) for round in history)
    total_cooperate = sum(action == 'C' for round in history for action in round)
    avg_coop_rate = total_cooperate / total_actions if total_actions != 0 else 1.0
    
    # Assess stock health (e.g., above 70% of capacity and growing)
    stock_health = stock_level >= 0.7 * capacity
    if rounds_remaining > 1:
        prev_stock = history[-1]['stock']
        stock_growth = stock_level - prev_stock
        stock_health = stock_health and stock_growth > 0
    
    # Determine threshold based on remaining rounds
    if rounds_remaining < 5:
        threshold = 0.3 * rounds_remaining / 5
    else:
        threshold = 0.7
    
    # Decision logic
    if avg_coop_rate >= threshold and stock_health:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base.
- It monitors the group's cooperation rate and the stock's health dynamically. If both conditions are favorable, it continues cooperating; otherwise, it defects to prevent resource collapse.
- As rounds near completion, it shifts towards defecting to maximize immediate gains without worrying about long-term sustainability.
- The use of a dynamic threshold ensures adaptability based on current game state and historical behavior, balancing between cooperation for mutual benefit and defection when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_348 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation (ARC)

**Objective:** Maximize collective payoff by encouraging sustainable resource use through adaptive cooperation and reciprocal actions.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to signal willingness to sustain the resource and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Until Last 10%):**
   a. Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the immediately preceding round.
   b. If at least 50% of players Cooperated, Cooperate in the current round.
   c. If less than 50% Cooperated, Defect (D) to signal disapproval and prevent being exploited.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   a. Assess the current stock level relative to capacity.
   b. Calculate potential payoffs from both Cooperating and Defecting considering remaining rounds:
      - If Cooperating keeps the stock within sustainable levels while providing decent cumulative payoffs, continue Cooperating.
      - If Defecting yields higher immediate payoff without causing significant depletion, consider Defecting but balance to avoid collapse.

4. **Adaptive Adjustment:**
   Use a weighted average of cooperation rates over the last 3 rounds to smooth out short-term fluctuations and avoid over-reacting to transient changes in behavior.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Balance between maximizing immediate payoffs and maintaining resource levels for potential future cooperation, especially if the stock is still high.
- **Small n (e.g., n=2):** Use the same 50% threshold. For even splits, treat as Cooperate to encourage mutual benefit.

---

### **Collective Mindset Alignment**

The strategy promotes a mindset where players are incentivized to Cooperate when others do, reinforcing sustainability and shared benefits. By reciprocally defecting when others exploit, it deters free-riding and encourages mutual cooperation.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(round_history, current_stock, total_rounds, round_number):
    n = len(round_history)  # Number of players

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate (last 3 rounds)
    lookback = min(3, round_number - 1)
    total_cooperate = sum(round['cooperate_count'] for round in round_history[-lookback:])
    cooperate_rate = total_cooperate / (n * lookback)

    if cooperate_rate >= 0.5:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

    # For last few rounds: adapt based on stock level and payoffs
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        simulate_cooperate_payoff = current_stock / (2 * n)
        remaining_depletion = sum([simulate_cooperate_payoff for _ in range(total_rounds - round_number + 1)])
        # Simplified growth check
        if current_stock - remaining_depletion >= current_stock * 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

    return 'C'  # Default to Cooperate if no conditions met
```

### **Summary**

The Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation (ARC) strategy promotes sustainable resource use by encouraging mutual cooperation and adapting based on observed behavior. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors in the tournament.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_349 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative Strategy with Tit-for-Tat Elements

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while promoting sustainable resource use through cooperation, adapting to other players' behaviors.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

#### **Initial Rounds:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This sets a positive precedent and encourages others to cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** Continue Cooperating unless evidence suggests significant defection by others.

#### **Dynamic Adaptation:**
- **Monitor Consumption Patterns:** Track the average consumption per player. If the stock decreases significantly, it may indicate Defectors.
- **Threshold-Based Switching:**
  - If the stock falls below a dynamically adjusted threshold (based on historical sustainable levels), consider defecting to maximize immediate gain before potential resource depletion.

#### **Tit-for-Tat Element:**
- Observe the majority action in the previous round. If the majority Cooperated, continue Cooperating; if the majority Defected, consider Defecting.
- Introduce a tolerance level (e.g., 30% of players defecting) before switching strategies to avoid overreacting to minor defections.

#### **Edge Cases:**
- **Last Round Detection:** If rounds are known or inferred as nearing conclusion, switch to Defecting to maximize individual gain in the final round.
- **Stock Collapse Warning:** If stock is critically low, switch to Defecting to salvage remaining resources.

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**

#### **First Round:**
- Cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and sustain the resource base for future rounds.

#### **Last Round (if known):**
- Defect to maximize individual payoff since there are no future rounds for retaliation or cooperation.

#### **Stock Collapse Scenarios:**
- If stock is nearing critical levels, defect to secure as much as possible before potential collapse.

### **3. Collective Mindset Alignment**

The strategy emphasizes sustainability and mutual benefit when possible. By initially Cooperating, it encourages others to do the same, maintaining a healthy resource level. The Tit-for-Tat element allows adaptation to other players' actions, promoting fairness and deterring excessive defection.

---

### **Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, n, r):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if it's the last round (if known)
    if is_last_round(history, r):
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate historical cooperation rate
    prev_coop = sum(1 for actions in history.values() if actions[-1] == 'C') / n
    
    # Determine current stock status relative to sustainable level
    sustainable_threshold = calculate_sustainable_threshold(current_stock, n)
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity  # Assuming capacity is known
    
    # If stock is below sustainable threshold, consider defecting
    if stock_ratio < sustainable_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    # Tit-for-Tat element: mimic majority action from previous round
    prev_round_actions = history[0][-1]  # Assuming all players have same history length
    majority_action = max(set(prev_round_actions), key=prev_round_actions.count)
    
    if majority_action == 'C':
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Consider defecting only if a significant number of players defected
        num_defectors = prev_round_actions.count('D')
        if num_defectors / n > DEFECT_TOLERANCE:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### **Notes:**
- **Dynamic Threshold:** The sustainable threshold should be adjusted based on historical data to reflect changing conditions and player behaviors.
- **DEFECT_TOLERANCE:** A predefined threshold (e.g., 0.3) indicating the proportion of defectors needed before switching strategies.

This strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically to promote cooperation while protecting against excessive defection.

In a single-shot game where all players act simultaneously and without knowledge of others' choices, the Nash equilibrium occurs when every player defects. This leads to the immediate depletion of the resource because the total consumption exceeds the available stock.

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_351 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation among players in a scenario with simultaneous moves and no communication, we propose an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts based on observed behavior and stock levels. This approach aims to maximize collective payoff by encouraging cooperation while addressing defection when necessary.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate to establish a baseline and maximize initial payoffs while maintaining the stock level.

2. **Assess Stock Health:**
   - Track the stock level after each round (S_t) and monitor whether it is increasing, decreasing, or stable over time.
   - Calculate the trend of S over recent rounds to determine if cooperation is effective.

3. **Determine Cooperation Rate:**
   - Observe the number of Cooperate actions from all players in recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - If a high proportion of players are Cooperating, continue to do so to sustain the stock and encourage others.

4. **Adjust Based on Stock Trends:**
   - If despite cooperation, the stock level is significantly decreasing, it indicates that too many players are defecting.
   - Switch to Defect for a certain number of rounds (e.g., 3) to signal others and attempt to reset the dynamics.

5. **Re-evaluate After Defection Period:**
   - After defecting for the set number of rounds, check if the stock has stabilized or started increasing again.
   - If conditions improve, revert back to Cooperate; else, continue defecting for a bit longer.

### Key Considerations:

- **Thresholds:** Use thresholds based on stock levels (e.g., high at 80% capacity and low at 20%) and cooperation rates to decide when to switch modes.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** The strategy should adapt to changing conditions, adjusting the number of defecting rounds and thresholds based on game parameters like the number of players (n) and capacity.
- **Preventing Tragedy of the Commons:** By punishing defectors through temporary defection, the strategy incentivizes cooperation and prevents long-term stock depletion.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(history, current_stock, n):
    if not history:  # First round
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    recent_rounds = min(5, len(history))  # Look back at last 5 rounds or fewer if not enough
    total_players = n
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate in recent rounds
    coop_actions = sum(round_data['coop_count'] for round_data in history[-recent_rounds:])
    coop_rate = coop_actions / (total_players * recent_rounds)
    
    # Define thresholds
    high_threshold = 0.8 * current_stock_capacity
    low_threshold = 0.2 * current_stock_capacity
    
    if current_stock >= high_threshold:
        return 'Cooperate'
    elif current_stock <= low_threshold:
        return 'Defect'
    else:
        # If most players have been Cooperating, continue to Cooperate
        if coop_rate > 0.7:  # Example threshold
            return 'Cooperate'
        else:
            # Check if in Defection Mode or transitioning back
            recent_defectors = sum(round_data['defect_count'] for round_data in history[-recent_rounds:])
            if recent_defectors / (total_players * recent_rounds) > 0.3:  # Example threshold
                return 'Defect'
            else:
                return 'Cooperate'
```

### Final Answer:

To maintain cooperation and optimize collective payoffs, players should start by Cooperating in the first round. They continue to Cooperate if most others are doing so and the stock remains healthy. If the stock decreases despite high cooperation or too many defect, they switch to Defect temporarily to signal others. This strategy balances sustaining resources with addressing defection, preventing long-term depletion.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{
\text{Players should initially Cooperate, continue if most do so and stock is stable, otherwise switch to Defect temporarily to encourage cooperation and prevent resource depletion.}
}

The strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game is a balanced approach that encourages cooperation while adapting to potential defections or resource depletion. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

### Strategy Overview:
- **Initial Move:** Start by Cooperating in the first round to maintain high stock levels.
- **Adaptive Play:** For subsequent rounds (except the last), Cooperate if both current stock is above 80% of capacity and a majority cooperated in the previous round. Otherwise, Defect.
- **Final Round Adjustment:** Always Defect in the last round as there's no future punishment.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round:**
   - Action: Cooperate
     - Reason: Maintain high stock levels to encourage sustainable use.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Check two conditions:
     a. **Stock Level:** Is the current stock above 80% of capacity?
     b. **Recent Cooperation:** Did more than half of players Cooperate in the last round?
   - If both conditions are met:
     - Action: Cooperate
       - Reason: Sustained cooperation keeps resources healthy.
   - Else:
     - Action: Defect
       - Reason: Prevent further resource depletion or respond to previous defections.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Action: Defect
     - Reason: Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Rationale:
- The strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains.
- By Cooperating when conditions are favorable, it maintains resource health and encourages others to do the same.
- Switching to Defect when cooperation falters or resources dwindle prevents further depletion and incentivizes others to reconsider their strategies.

This approach ensures a collective effort to sustain resources while adapting to changing behaviors and resource levels.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_353 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation for long-term resource sustainability with defection for immediate gains, we propose an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts players' actions based on observed trends in resource levels. Here is a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to help maintain or increase the resource level.
2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Track historical stock levels and adjust a threshold dynamically. If the current stock is above this threshold, players Cooperate; otherwise, they Defect.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Use a sliding window of past rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds) to determine if the resource level is increasing or decreasing. This helps in deciding whether to continue Cooperating or switch to Defecting.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate. This helps maintain the resource at its maximum capacity or allows it to regrow if depleted.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**:
   - After each round, calculate a dynamic threshold based on historical data.
   - For example, compute an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of past stock levels. The EWMA gives more weight to recent observations, allowing the strategy to adapt quickly to changes.
   - Formula: \( \text{Threshold}_t = \alpha \times \text{Stock}_{t-1} + (1-\alpha) \times \text{Threshold}_{t-1} \), where \( 0 < \alpha < 1 \).

3. **Decision Making**:
   - In each subsequent round, compare the current stock level with the dynamically adjusted threshold.
     - If **Current Stock > Threshold**: Cooperate to preserve or rebuild the resource.
     - If **Current Stock ≤ Threshold**: Defect to maximize immediate gains, especially if the resource is showing signs of depletion.

4. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Maintain a window of recent stock levels (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - Calculate the trend (slope) over this window using linear regression.
   - If the trend indicates an increasing resource level, continue Cooperating.
   - If the trend shows a decrease, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect in the final round since there are no future consequences for depleting the resource.
   - **Very Low Stock**: If the stock is critically low, prioritize defecting to salvage whatever gains possible before the resource collapses.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's illustrate this strategy with a sample scenario where \( n = 4 \), capacity = 100, and rounds = 5.

- **Round 1**: All players Cooperate. Stock remains at 100.
- **Round 2**: Calculate threshold based on Round 1 stock (100). Suppose α = 0.3; Threshold₂ ≈ 97. Since Stock₂ is 100 > 97, Cooperate again. Stock remains 100.
- **Round 3**: Similar to Round 2, players Cooperate as Stock > Threshold.
- **Round 4**: Suppose a few players start Defecting. Stock drops to 85. Threshold₄ is adjusted lower (e.g., 90). Since 85 < 90, more players switch to Defecting.
- **Round 5 (Final Round)**: All players Defect to maximize their last gains.

### Conclusion:

This adaptive strategy allows players to dynamically respond to the state of the resource. By balancing cooperation and defection based on historical trends and current levels, it aims to sustain the resource while allowing for opportunistic gains when necessary. This approach is robust against varying numbers of Cooperators and Defectors, ensuring a sustainable outcome where possible.

**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The collective strategy aims to sustain cooperation while adapting to potential threats from defectors. It balances current stock levels with recent behavior patterns to decide actions, ensuring long-term resource sustainability.

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to establish a baseline of sustainable resource use.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Check Stock Level**: If the current stock is above 70% of capacity, continue cooperating.
   - **Evaluate Recent Defection Rates**: If the stock is below this threshold, calculate the proportion of defects in the last m rounds (e.g., 3 rounds).
     - **Defect Decision**: If the defect rate exceeds 30%, defect to reduce consumption and prevent further depletion.
     - **Cooperate Decision**: Otherwise, cooperate, assuming others maintain sustainable practices.

3. **Final Rounds**: Continue cooperating to preserve the resource for as long as possible, maximizing overall payoffs even in the last rounds.

This strategy ensures cooperation when resources are healthy, switches to defection if necessary, and maintains sustainability through critical phases of the game.

description_COLLECTIVE_355 = '''
The collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize total payoff while maintaining a sustainable resource level. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Begin with cooperation in the first few rounds to maintain a stable stock level and encourage others to cooperate.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Use a dynamic threshold based on the current stock relative to capacity, adjusted by the number of remaining rounds.
   - Formula: `threshold = (current_stock / capacity) * adjustment_factor`
     - `adjustment_factor` decreases as rounds progress, lowering the required stock for cooperation.

3. **Behavioral Observation and Adaptation:**
   - Monitor the proportion of players defecting in each round.
   - Lower cooperation threshold if there's significant defection to prevent resource depletion.

4. **Endgame Adjustment:**
   - In later rounds (e.g., last 20%), increase defection likelihood as future impacts are minimal, maximizing immediate payoff.

### Detailed Strategy

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - Cooperate to build a stable stock base.
   - Observe others' actions to inform future decisions.

2. **Threshold Calculation:**
   - Adjust threshold each round based on remaining rounds and stock growth/decline.
   - Example:
     ```
     adjustment_factor = max(0.1, 1 - (round_number / total_rounds))
     threshold = current_stock * adjustment_factor
     ```

3. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Track stock changes to assess sustainability.
   - If stock drops significantly, reduce cooperation threshold.

4. **Defection Trigger:**
   - Cooperate if `current_stock >= threshold`.
   - Defect otherwise, especially in later rounds.

5. **Learning and Smoothing:**
   - Use a conservative approach to adjust thresholds based on past performance.
   - Smooth out sudden changes using weighted averages of stock levels.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    # Initial cooperation in the first 20% rounds
    if round_number <= 0.2 * total_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate adjustment factor based on remaining rounds
    progress = (round_number - 1) / (total_rounds - 1)
    adjustment_factor = max(0.1, 1 - progress)
    threshold = current_stock * adjustment_factor
    
    # Check if stock is below the threshold or nearing the end
    if round_number >= 0.8 * total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    # Determine action based on stock relative to threshold
    if current_stock >= threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Conclusion

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation thresholds. It adapts to others' behavior through observed actions and adjusts in later rounds to maximize payoff without assuming coordination beyond observable outcomes.

description_COLLECTIVE_356 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable resource while responding to potential exploitation by others, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with adaptive defection based on the current state of the resource. Here's the step-by-step explanation and the final answer:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by always cooperating in the initial rounds. This helps maintain the resource at its maximum capacity since cooperation leads to sustainable use, as consumption is balanced by growth.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels:** Continuously observe the current stock level relative to the initial capacity. This allows players to detect when the resource starts to deplete significantly due to others' actions.

3. **Threshold for Defection:** Establish a critical threshold (e.g., 60% of the initial capacity). If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to defecting. The rationale is that significant depletion indicates potential exploitation by others, so maximizing immediate gains becomes crucial before the resource is exhausted.

4. **Return to Cooperation:** Once the stock recovers above the critical threshold, revert to cooperation. This helps in maintaining sustainable use again if the resource stabilizes or starts growing once more.

### Final Answer:

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold-Based Defection**

Each player follows these rules:
- Cooperate in all rounds until the current stock drops below 60% of the initial capacity.
- Once the stock falls below this threshold, defect to maximize immediate payoffs.
- If the stock recovers above 60%, switch back to cooperation.

This strategy ensures sustainable resource use when possible while allowing players to adapt and respond to significant depletion caused by others' exploitation.

**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to promote sustainable use of the common pool resource while adapting to other players' behaviors. It balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and past actions.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

- **Initial Round:**
  - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - **Reasoning:** Start by cooperating to encourage others to do the same, fostering a sustainable resource.

- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - **Stock Above 80% of Capacity:**
    - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
    - **Reasoning:** High stock allows for sustainable consumption and growth. Cooperating maintains this balance.

  - **Stock Between 40% and 80% of Capacity:**
    - **Action Determined by Past Behavior:**
      - Calculate the proportion of other players who cooperated in the previous round.
      - If more than half (≥51%) of other players Cooperated, choose C.
      - Otherwise, choose D to maximize immediate payoff while others are defecting.

  - **Stock Below 40% of Capacity:**
    - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
    - **Reasoning:** The resource is strained. Cooperating helps rebuild the stock and promote sustainability for future rounds.

---

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent.

- **Last Round (if known):**
  - While there might be temptation to Defect for higher payoff, continue Cooperating to maintain trust and encourage others to do the same in future interactions.

---

### **3. Collective Mindset Alignment**

The strategy aligns with a collective mindset focused on long-term sustainability and mutual cooperation:

- **Sustainability:** Prioritizes maintaining the resource above critical thresholds (e.g., 40%) to avoid collapse.
- **Reciprocity:** Encourages others to Cooperate by responding to their actions. If many Cooperate, continue Cooperating; if many Defect, consider switching to D to adapt.

---

### **Pseudocode**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, previous_actions):
    n = len(previous_actions) + 1  # Number of players including self

    # First round: always Cooperate
    if len(previous_actions) == 0:
        return 'C'

    # Determine stock thresholds relative to capacity
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.4 * capacity

    # Current stock level
    S = current_stock

    # Decision based on stock level and past behavior
    if S > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif S < low_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate proportion of Cooperations in previous round
        last_round_coop = sum(1 for actions in previous_actions[-1] if actions == 'C') / n

        # If majority (≥50%) Cooperated, Cooperate; else Defect
        if last_round_coop >= 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage:
n = 4
capacity = 100
initial_stock = capacity
previous_actions = []

for _ in range(3):  # Simulate 3 rounds
    action = decide_action(initial_stock, capacity, previous_actions)
    print(f"Action: {action}")
    # Update stock based on action and other players' actions (simplified for example)
    if action == 'C':
        initial_stock -= 100 / (2 * n)
    else:
        initial_stock -= 100 / n
    previous_actions.append([action] + ['D']*(n-1))  # Assume others Defect
```

---

### **Summary**

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and past actions, encouraging sustainability while responding to potential exploitation. It is designed to be robust against a variety of opponent behaviors in repeated interactions.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to promote sustainability and observe others' actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Check Stock Level:** After each round, evaluate the current stock level.
     - If the stock remains above a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Monitor Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Track the number of players who Defected in previous rounds when the stock was high.
   - If a significant proportion (e.g., >50%) of players Defected despite high stock levels, adopt a more aggressive Defect strategy in future rounds.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (approximately 20% of total rounds), switch to Defecting regardless of stock level, as future payoffs are no longer a factor.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
initialize:
    cooperate_next_round = True

for each round in r:
    if round == 1:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        remaining_stock = current_stock
        growth_rate = calculate_growth(remaining_stock, capacity)
        expected_stock = remaining_stock + growth_rate

        # Check if stock is above threshold
        if expected_stock > threshold:
            action = Cooperate
        else:
            action = Defect

        # Consider past defection rates
        if recent_defections_high():
            action = Defect

    # Update state based on current actions
    update_stock(action, others_actions)

    # Prepare for next round
    cooperate_next_round = determine_cooperate_next()
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to encourage mutual sustainability.
- **Last Rounds (e.g., last 20%):** Switch to Defecting to exploit remaining resources.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability, adapting dynamically based on stock levels and opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_359 = '''
To address the problem of determining whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock level relative to capacity, we'll outline a structured strategy. The goal is to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by considering the current stock level as an indicator of resource abundance.

### Approach
The strategy involves using thresholds to decide actions:
1. **Cooperate when the stock is above 70% of capacity:** This indicates ample resources, encouraging contribution to maintain stability.
2. **Defect when the stock is below 30% of capacity:** At this low level, defecting may still provide a benefit without causing significant further depletion.

This approach aims to maximize immediate gains while preventing over-depletion, ensuring sustainability for future rounds.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity):
    if current_stock > 0.7 * capacity:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif current_stock < 0.3 * capacity:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        return "Cooperate"

# Example usage:
current_stock = 80  # Example value
capacity = 100      # Example value
print(decide_action(current_stock, capacity))
```

### Explanation
- **Thresholds:** The strategy uses 70% and 30% of the capacity as thresholds to decide actions. Cooperating above 70% helps maintain a healthy stock level, while defecting below 30% allows for immediate gains without contributing to over-depletion.
- **Decision Logic:** By evaluating the current stock against these thresholds, the decision-making process ensures a balance between contributing to resource sustainability and seeking personal gain.

This approach provides a clear and actionable strategy based on observable conditions, fostering both individual benefit and collective resource management.

description_COLLECTIVE_360 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability while deterring defection through adaptive behavior.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to set a positive precedent and encourage mutual cooperation.

2. **Stock Level Monitoring**: Assess the current stock level each round relative to capacity (high >75%, medium 50-74%, low <25%).

3. **Adaptive Actions**:
   - **High Stock (Above 75%)**: Cooperate unless others have defected in previous rounds when cooperation was expected.
   - **Medium Stock (50-74%)**: Monitor and adapt based on recent player behavior, leaning towards cooperation if others are cooperating.
   - **Low Stock (<25%)**: Consider defecting to maximize immediate payoff but be open to cooperation if others start doing so.

4. **Punishment Mechanism**: Defect in subsequent rounds if a player defects when the stock is healthy (above 50%), punishing them for irresponsible behavior.

5. **Forgiveness**: If a previously defective player starts cooperating, especially when the stock is low, forgive and revert to cooperation to rebuild trust and sustainability.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.
   - **Full Stock (Capacity)**: Cooperate confidently as growth can sustain any consumption.

### Pseudocode:

```python
players = {i: 'cooperative' for i in range(1, n+1)}
last_rounds = []

def decide_action(current_stock):
    if current_stock >= 0.75 * capacity:
        action = 'C'
        # Punish those who defected when stock was healthy
        for player in players:
            if player in last_rounds and last_rounds[player] == 'D':
                return 'D'
    elif 0.25 * capacity <= current_stock < 0.75 * capacity:
        action = 'C' if all(players[p] == 'cooperative') else 'D'
    else: # current_stock < 0.25 * capacity
        action = 'D'
    
    return action

for each round in rounds:
    for player in players:
        last_rounds[player] = decide_action(stock)
    update stock based on all actions
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Round**: All players start by cooperating to foster a cooperative environment.
- **High Stock (Above 75%)**: Players cooperate, but if others have defected when the stock was healthy, they defect in response.
- **Medium Stock (50-74%)**: Players monitor recent behavior; if most are cooperative, they continue; otherwise, they may defect.
- **Low Stock (<25%)**: Players defect to maximize payoff but can revert to cooperation if others do so.
- **Punishment and Forgiveness**: Defectors are punished by others defecting in subsequent rounds, encouraging them to cooperate again.

This strategy adaptively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, promoting cooperation while deterring defection through conditional behavior.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The approach is adaptive, dynamically adjusting based on previous rounds' outcomes and current stock levels.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to start sustainably.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** Evaluate the previous round's consumption and stock level to decide actions:
   - **If cooperation was successful:** Continue Cooperating.
   - **If many Defected:** Switch to Defect for a few rounds to encourage others to cooperate.
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** If the stock is low, prioritize Cooperating to aid regrowth.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Round 1:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation encourages sustainable use and sets a positive precedent.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   - **Step 1: Evaluate Previous Consumption:**
     - Calculate the total consumption in the last round.
     - Compare it to expected consumption if all Cooperated (n * S/(2n) = S/2) and all Defected (n * S/n = S).
     - Determine which scenario the actual consumption is closer to.
   - **Step 2: Decide Current Action:**
     - If closer to Cooperate, continue Cooperating.
     - If closer to Defect, switch to Defect for up to 3 rounds or until cooperation is observed again.
   - **Step 3: Consider Stock Level:**
     - If the current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), prioritize Cooperating regardless of previous consumption to aid regrowth.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Since there's no future consequence, maximize immediate payoff.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **Low Stock:** Shift to Cooperating to help regrow the stock.
- **High Defection Detected:** Temporarily switch to Defecting to encourage others to cooperate in future rounds.

This strategy is adaptive and robust, allowing it to respond to various opponent behaviors while maintaining a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to observed behavior and current state. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Cooperation Threshold**: Cooperate when the stock level is above 75% of capacity. This ensures sustainable resource use.
2. **Defection Threshold**: Defect when the stock drops below 75%. This prevents further depletion and potential collapse.
3. **First Round Behavior**: Start by cooperating to encourage others to do the same, as initial stock levels are set at full capacity.
4. **Adaptability**: Adjust actions based on current stock levels each round, without relying on complex history analysis.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Action**: In the first round, cooperate to promote a sustainable start.
2. **Threshold-Based Action**:
   - **Cooperate** if current stock > 75% of capacity.
   - **Defect** if current stock ≤ 75% of capacity.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round**: Defect for maximum immediate payoff, as there's no future impact.
   - **Stock Near Capacity**: If the stock is near full in a subsequent round, revert to cooperation.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_363 = '''
To address the problem of determining whether to cooperate or defect based on the current state of a shared resource, we can employ a strategic approach that balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability. The strategy involves setting a threshold for the critical stock level and adjusting decisions based on the number of remaining rounds.

### Approach
1. **Define Critical Stock Level (T):** Set a threshold as half of the capacity (0.5 * C). This serves as the minimum stock level required to sustain cooperation.
2. **Assess Remaining Rounds:** Determine if the current round is among the last two rounds. In these final rounds, defecting provides higher immediate payoffs without concern for future consequences.
3. **Decision Making:**
   - If in one of the last two rounds, defect to maximize immediate gain.
   - Otherwise, cooperate if the current stock (S) is above the threshold (T). This helps maintain sustainable resource levels.
   - Defect if the current stock is below T to avoid contributing to resource collapse.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(S, C, current_round, total_rounds):
    """
    Decides whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock level, capacity,
    current round number, and total rounds.
    
    Parameters:
        S (int): Current stock level of the resource.
        C (int): Total capacity of the resource.
        current_round (int): 1-based index of the current round.
        total_rounds (int): Total number of rounds in the game.
        
    Returns:
        str: "cooperate" or "defect"
    """
    T = 0.5 * C  # Threshold is half of capacity
    k_last_rounds = 2  # Number of last rounds to defect
    
    # Check if it's one of the last k rounds
    remaining = total_rounds - current_round + 1
    if remaining <= k_last_rounds:
        return "defect"
    
    # Decide based on stock level and threshold
    if S >= T:
        return "cooperate"
    else:
        return "defect"
```

### Explanation
The strategy begins by establishing a critical stock threshold (T) at half the resource capacity. This ensures that cooperation is only maintained when there's enough resource to avoid collapse. The decision-making process checks if the current round is among the last two, in which case defecting maximizes immediate payoffs. For other rounds, cooperation continues as long as the stock remains above T, promoting sustainability. If the stock drops below T, defecting prevents further resource degradation.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, providing a structured way to decide actions based on the current state and future considerations.

description_COLLECTIVE_364 = '''
**Final Answer:**

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance individual gain with collective sustainability by adapting based on observed behavior and stock levels. Here's a structured approach:

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to encourage others to maintain the resource and test their intentions.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock level is above 80% of capacity, cooperate to sustain the resource.
   - If the stock is below this threshold, consider defecting if a significant number of opponents have defected in previous rounds (e.g., more than 30%).
3. **Response to Defection**: Track the cooperation rate of opponents. If a high proportion (e.g., over 50%) have defected recently, increase defection frequency to penalize and encourage future cooperation.
4. **Last Round Handling**: Defect in the final round to maximize individual payoff since there's no future retaliation.

### Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Default to cooperation to set a positive tone.
- **Last Round**: Switch to defecting to capitalize on the lack of future rounds for potential retaliation.

### Adaptation Over Time:
- The strategy dynamically adjusts based on observed opponent actions and stock levels. If cooperation leads to sustainability, maintain it; if defection is widespread, respond with more defection to discourage further depletion.

This approach ensures a balance between individual benefits and collective resource management, adapting to various opponent behaviors while maintaining robustness across different scenarios.

description_COLLECTIVE_365 = '''
**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to adapt dynamically, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It employs a threshold-based approach influenced by historical data and current stock levels.

1. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: 
   - Calculate a dynamic threshold based on past behavior and growth trends. This threshold determines when to cooperate or defect.
   - The threshold adjusts each round to reflect the evolving state of the stock and players' actions.

2. **Initial Round Strategy**:
   - Start with cooperation in the first round to establish a baseline and encourage others to contribute sustainably.

3. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate**: If the current stock is above the dynamic threshold, indicating sufficient resources for sustainable use.
   - **Defect**: If below the threshold, suggesting resource depletion that necessitates immediate gain to prevent further collapse.

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Track historical trends of stock levels and players' actions (cooperation or defection rates) to predict future behavior.
   - Adjust the threshold dynamically based on these trends, ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Default to cooperation to foster a sustainable initial state.
   - **Last Round**: Consider defecting for maximum immediate payoff since there's no future impact, though this depends on the current stock level and threshold.

6. **Sustainability Balance**:
   - When the stock is low, prioritize actions that allow recovery, even if it means lower immediate payoffs.
   - Monitor growth patterns to ensure that cooperation leads to resource replenishment rather than depletion.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining collective sustainability, adapting robustly to various opponent behaviors through dynamic adjustments and historical feedback.

description_COLLECTIVE_366 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting decisions based on the current stock level and historical actions of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to maintain a healthy stock level and encourage others to do the same, preventing rapid depletion.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Stock Thresholds:**
     - **Above 80% of Capacity:** Cooperate to sustain the resource and allow it to recover.
     - **Below 60% of Capacity:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since the resource is critically low.
     - **Between 60-80%:** Use a mixed strategy:
       - **Cooperate** with higher probability if recent history shows others are mostly cooperating.
       - **Defect** if there's significant defection by others, preventing exploitation.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 2 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff as there's no future round to consider sustainability.

### Decision Rules

- **Cooperate When:**
  - The stock is above 80% of capacity.
  - Recent actions indicate a majority of other players are cooperating, promoting mutual sustainability.

- **Defect When:**
  - The stock is below 60%, indicating critical depletion.
  - Observing significant defection by others (e.g., more than 50% defect in recent rounds), necessitating self-protection.

### Adaptation and Robustness

- The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the observed state (stock level) and historical actions, ensuring adaptability against various opponent behaviors without relying on coordination.
- It balances immediate gains with long-term resource management, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting to prevent exploitation or in critical states.

This approach ensures a robust and adaptive strategy that aligns with collective sustainability while protecting against exploitation.

1. **Initial Strategy**: Begin with Cooperation for the first few rounds to help maintain or build up the stock.

2. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - Set initial thresholds: `T_high = 0.8 * capacity` and `T_low = 0.5 * capacity`.
   - Adjust these thresholds dynamically based on whether the stock increases or decreases each round.

3. **Decision Rule for Each Round**:
   - If the current stock (`S`) is above `T_high`, Cooperate.
   - If `S` is below `T_low`, Defect.
   - For moderate stock levels between `T_low` and `T_high`:
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate from the last `k` rounds (e.g., 5 rounds).
     - If more than `Y%` (e.g., 70%) of players Cooperated, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

4. **Threshold Adjustment**:
   - After each round, adjust thresholds based on stock trend:
     - Increase `T_high` if the stock increased and decrease it if it decreased.
     - Decrease `T_low` if the stock increased to encourage Defection when necessary, and increase it if the stock decreased.

5. **Endgame Consideration**: In the last few rounds, prioritize Cooperation to maximize total payoffs.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is a dynamic approach that balances cooperation with defection based on current resource levels and historical behavior. Players should:

- Cooperate when the resource level is high or when most others have recently cooperated.
- Defect when the resource is low or when others are mostly defecting.
- Adjust their thresholds dynamically based on whether the resource is increasing or decreasing.

This strategy maximizes long-term payoffs by promoting sustainable cooperation while responding to potential over-consumption threats. The final decision rule is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock is high or most players cooperate; else, defect}}

**Final Answer: Adaptive Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize collective benefits while ensuring sustainability, adapting dynamically to game conditions.

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Cooperate (C):** When the stock level is above a dynamic threshold, calculated as a moving average of recent stock levels adjusted by historical growth rates and opponents' actions.
- **Defect (D):** When the stock level falls below this threshold or if past cooperation led to significant depletion.

### 2. Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to encourage sustainable use and assess opponents' behavior.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate gains, as there are no future consequences.

### 3. Collective Mindset:
Aim for mutual benefit by maintaining a balance between resource sustainability and individual payoff. Use historical data to adjust thresholds adaptively, ensuring the strategy evolves with game dynamics.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock, history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    if round == r:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate dynamic threshold based on moving average and growth potential
    avg_stock = moving_average(history['stock'])
    growth_potential = 2 * (1 - avg_stock / capacity)
    threshold = 0.6 * capacity + 0.4 * (avg_stock * growth_potential)
    
    if stock > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
- **Dynamic Threshold:** Adjusts based on historical stock levels and potential recovery, encouraging cooperation when sustainable.
- **Adaptation:** Uses moving averages to smooth out volatility, avoiding overreaction to single-round changes.
- **Learning Mechanism:** Incorporates past outcomes to refine decisions, balancing between cooperation for sustainability and defecting to secure gains.

This strategy aims to foster a stable environment where cooperation is rewarded unless necessary adjustments are needed to prevent resource depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_369 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in managing a shared resource, we propose a strategic approach that reacts dynamically to the state of the resource and historical trends. Here is a structured and elegant presentation of the strategy:

### Strategic Approach for Resource Management

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase**
   - **Objective:** Establish a healthy baseline for the resource.
   - **Action:** Cooperate in the first few rounds (e.g., 2-3 rounds) to prevent early depletion.

2. **Dynamic Thresholds for Decision Making**
   - **Upper Threshold (T_high):** Set at 80% of capacity (0.8 * C).
   - **Lower Threshold (T_low):** Set at 60% of capacity (0.6 * C).
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - **Above T_high:** Cooperate if past consumption indicates others are also managing the resource sustainably. Otherwise, defect cautiously.
     - **Between T_high and T_low:** Implement a mixed strategy where cooperation likelihood increases as stock approaches T_low.
     - **Below T_low:** Always cooperate to facilitate regrowth and prevent crashes.

3. **Monitoring Stock Trends**
   - **Action:** Track percentage changes in stock levels over recent rounds.
   - **Threshold Response:** If the stock decreases by more than a predefined percentage (e.g., 10%) over past rounds, switch to cooperation even if the current stock is above T_high.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment**
   - **Objective:** Maximize immediate payoffs while preventing resource crash.
   - **Action:** In the last 10% of rounds, defect unless the stock is below T_low, in which case cooperate to allow some recovery.

### Safeguards and Considerations

- **Preventive Measures Against Crashes:** By monitoring past consumption trends, the strategy can preemptively switch to cooperation if others' actions indicate overexploitation.
- **Optimal Sustainable Yield:** While the primary thresholds are set at 80% and 60%, being mindful of the resource's maximum growth rate around 50% capacity (c/2) can enhance long-term sustainability.

### Conclusion

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term resource conservation by dynamically adjusting actions based on observable stock levels and historical trends. It encourages cooperation when necessary and allows defecting cautiously when the resource is robust, aiming to sustain a healthy balance for optimal yield over time.

    previous_actions = state_history['previous_round_actions']

    # Initial Round
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Determine Stock Health
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.4 * capacity

    # If stock is healthy, Cooperate
    if stock >= high_threshold:
        return 'C'

    # If stock is low, Defect
    if stock <= low_threshold:
        return 'D'

    # Mid-level stock: Check previous actions
    total_cooperate = sum(1 for action in previous_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    cooperate_ratio = total_cooperate / n

    # Most Cooperated last round: Cooperate again
    if cooperate_ratio > 0.7:
        return 'C'
    
    # Many Defected last round: Retaliate with Defect
    else:
        return 'D'

    # Endgame Adjustment
    if round_number >= r - (r * 0.1):
        return 'D'
```

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperator**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - In the first round, Cooperate (C) to encourage a cooperative environment.
   - For rounds until the last 20%, calculate:
     - **R**: The average proportion of Cooperate actions in the last k rounds (k=3 or 5).
     - **S**: Current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If both R > 60% and S > 70% of capacity, Cooperate; else, Defect.
   - In the last 20% of rounds, always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**

   - **Last Few Rounds (last 20%)**: Always Defect regardless of other factors.

3. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   The strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability by adapting to others' actions and the current stock level, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion.

            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
- **Initial Cooperate**: Encourages others to cooperate by setting a positive example.

**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting based on the stock level and historical behavior of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Cooperate (C):** If the current stock is above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), indicating sustainable levels.
- **Defect (D):** If the stock drops below this threshold, signaling the need for immediate extraction to prevent resource collapse.

### 2. Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others to maintain sustainability.
- **Last Round:** Defect, as there's no future punishment for maximizing payoff in the final round.

### 3. Adaptation and Memory:
- Adjust cooperation/defection based on historical behavior: cooperate more if others have historically cooperated; defect if others have defected frequently, serving as a punitive measure against resource abuse.

### Strategy Summary:

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
function decide_action(current_stock, round_number, total_rounds):
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # Example threshold
    
    if current_stock > threshold:

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_373 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances individual gain with collective sustainability. The strategy dynamically adapts based on observed stock levels and past actions, ensuring robustness against diverse opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Sets a sustainable baseline by consuming less, allowing the resource to grow predictably.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:**
     - Use an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of past stock levels to assess sustainability.
     - The EWMA formula: `current_threshold = α * current_stock + (1 - α) * previous_threshold`
     - Parameter `α` (e.g., 0.7) determines the weight on recent data, balancing responsiveness and stability.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - If the current stock is above the EWMA threshold:
     - **Action:** Cooperate
     - **Rationale:** Indicates a sustainable resource level, maintaining long-term benefits.
   - If the current stock is below or equal to the threshold:
     - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - **Rationale:** Prevents further depletion and maximizes individual gain when cooperation isn't reciprocated.

4. **Defection Detection:**
   - Track whether cooperation leads to expected stock growth.
   - If unexpected depletion occurs, switch to defecting to protect against exploitation.

5. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Consider Defecting
   - **Rationale:** No future impact; maximize immediate gain unless others are cooperating, in which case continue Cooperating for higher payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(player_id, history, parameters):
    n = parameters['n']
    r = parameters['r']
    capacity = parameters['capacity']
    current_round = len(history)
    
    if current_round == 0:
        # Initial round: Cooperate
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of stock levels
    alpha = 0.7
    if current_round == 1:
        ewma_threshold = history[0]['stock']
    else:
        ewma_threshold = alpha * history[-1]['stock'] + (1 - alpha) * ewma_threshold
    
    # Decision based on current stock and EWMA threshold
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    
    if current_round >= r - 2:
        # Last few rounds: Consider defecting
        return 'D'
    
    if current_stock > ewma_threshold:
        # Cooperate if sustainable
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Defect if below threshold
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to establish a sustainable resource level.
- **Dynamic Threshold:** Uses EWMA to adaptively determine the sustainability threshold, balancing responsiveness and stability.
- **Sustainability Check:** Continuously assesses whether the current stock allows for continued cooperation or necessitates defecting.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment:** Maximizes individual gain in the final rounds while considering collective actions.

This strategy promotes long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation when beneficial and adapting to exploitational behaviors through defection, ensuring robust performance across diverse scenarios.

**Adaptive Cooperator Strategy**

The Adaptive Cooperator strategy balances cooperation with adaptive responses to maintain the common pool resource sustainably. It uses current stock levels and recent player actions to decide between cooperating (C) or defecting (D).

---

### **Decision Rules:**
1. **First Round:** Always Cooperate to encourage a cooperative environment.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **High Stock (S > 80% of capacity):** Cooperate to maintain the resource.
   - **Low Stock (S < 60% of capacity):**
     - Check the number of Defections in the previous two rounds by other players.
     - If more than half of the players Defected, respond with Defection.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate to aid recovery.
   - **Medium Stock (60% ≤ S ≤ 80%):**
     - Calculate the average Defection rate over the last three rounds.
     - If this rate exceeds 30%, Defect; else, Cooperate.

3. **Near End of Game (Last ~10% Rounds):** Always Cooperate to avoid depleting the resource in final rounds.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**
- **Stock Collapse (S = 0):** Continue Cooperating to attempt recovery.
- **Sustained Defection:** Adapt by defecting if others persistently defect.

This strategy aims to maintain cooperation while responding to exploitative behavior, ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

1. **Initial Rounds (First 3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to signal willingness to sustain the resource and observe others' behavior.

2. **Mid-Game (From Round 4 until 70% of Total Rounds):**

   - **If Current Stock > 60% of Capacity:**
     - **Action:** Defect.
     - **Rationale:** Higher stock allows defecting without immediate harm, maximizing personal gain while others may also defect.
   - **Else (Stock between 40%-60%):**
     - Calculate the cooperation rate in the last 3 rounds:
       - If >50% of players Cooperated: Cooperate to maintain mutual benefits.

3. **End-Game (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** No future rounds; prioritize maximizing immediate payoff.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**
- **Stock Near Zero (<20% Capacity):**
  - **Action:** Cooperate.

### **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
The strategy promotes sustainability by default, defecting only when safe or advantageous. It balances self-interest with collective well-being, adapting dynamically based on stock levels and others' actions.

        else:
            return 'D'
    
    if round_number >= endgame_round:

**Explanation:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by Cooperating to build a sustainable base.

To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a resource management scenario, we can employ a strategic approach that encourages cooperation when resources are abundant and switches to defecting when necessary to prevent collapse. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Define Thresholds**: Establish a threshold based on a fraction of the total capacity (e.g., 75%). This threshold determines when players should cooperate or defect.
   
2. **Cooperate When Resources Are Abundant**: If the current stock level is above the defined threshold, players should cooperate to sustain the resource and ensure stable payoffs.

3. **Defect When Necessary**: If the stock falls below the threshold, players switch to defecting. This allows them to maximize their immediate gains before potential collapse, though it risks further depleting the resource.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment of Thresholds**: Periodically reassess and adjust the threshold based on historical trends and the effectiveness of previous strategies. This ensures adaptability to changing conditions.

5. **Prevent Collapse**: Monitor stock levels closely. If the stock approaches critically low levels, consider reverting to cooperation or implementing measures to rebuild resources, even if it means accepting lower immediate gains.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy involves cooperating when the resource level is above a set threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) and defecting otherwise, adjusting dynamically to prevent collapse. This approach balances immediate benefits with long-term sustainability.

The Balanced Harvest strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to promote sustainable cooperation while adapting to different player behaviors and stock conditions. Here's a structured summary of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Balanced Harvest

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while maintaining a sustainable common pool resource.

**Key Components:**
1. **Stock State Categorization:**
   - **Healthy (H):** Stock ≥ 80% of capacity.
   - **Stressed (S):** 40% ≤ Stock < 80%.
   - **Endangered (E):** Stock < 40%.

2. **Decision Rules Based on Stock State:**
   - **Healthy (H):** Cooperate unless more than half of opponents have defected in the past.
   - **Stressed (S):** Defect if >50% of opponents have defected; otherwise, cooperate.
   - **Endangered (E):** Always defect to salvage remaining resources.

3. **Memory Mechanism:**
   - Track opponents' defection rates over time.
   - Punish persistent defectors by defecting in response.
   - Reward cooperation with continued cooperation.

### Detailed Strategy Description:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - All players start by Cooperating (C) to maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Healthy Stock (H):** Continue Cooperating unless historical data shows >50% defection among opponents.
     - Aim: Sustain the resource and encourage others to cooperate.
   - **Stressed Stock (S):** Defect if more than half of past actions from opponents were D; otherwise, Cooperate.
     - Aim: Punish defectors while maintaining cooperation when possible.
   - **Endangered Stock (E):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff before potential collapse.
     - Aim: Salvage remaining resources as the stock is unlikely to recover.

3. **Memory and Adaptation:**
   - Maintain a record of each opponent's past actions (C or D).
   - Use this history to inform current decisions, especially in transitioning between states.
   - Adjust thresholds based on observed behavior patterns to optimize outcomes.

### Performance Considerations:

- **Scalability:** The strategy adapts well to varying numbers of players and rounds, focusing on collective impact rather than individual influence.
- **Robustness:** It handles different opponent behaviors without relying on specific coordination mechanisms, promoting mutual cooperation through adaptive responses.
- **Edge Cases:** Special handling for the first round (cooperation) and the last round (state-based decision) ensures optimal outcomes regardless of the game's stage.

### Conclusion:

The Balanced Harvest strategy effectively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. By categorizing stock states and using historical data to inform decisions, it promotes cooperation while deterring defection, leading to a stable and productive common pool resource over multiple rounds.

description_COLLECTIVE_378 = '''
To address the problem of sustainably managing a shared resource, we can implement a strategy that encourages cooperation while allowing for adjustments based on the current state of the resource. The solution involves setting thresholds to determine when players should cooperate or defect, ensuring the resource remains stable over time.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Critical Threshold:** Determine a critical threshold (X) at which the resource level indicates whether cooperation is beneficial. In this case, X is set to half of the maximum capacity (cap/2).

2. **Define Player Strategies:** Each player will follow these rules:
   - If the current stock of the resource is above X (cap/2), players Cooperate by consuming a smaller share.
   - If the stock is below or equal to X, players Defect by consuming a larger share.

3. **Cooperation Mechanism:** When all players Cooperate (i.e., when the stock remains above cap/2), their consumption levels are set such that the total consumption does not exceed half of the resource's capacity each round. This maintains the stock at its maximum level due to growth replenishing it.

4. **Defection Adjustment:** If any player chooses to Defect, causing an increase in total consumption, the resource may temporarily drop below cap/2. In response, all players will adjust their behavior by defecting (consuming more), which might further decrease the stock but allows for higher individual payoffs in that round.

5. **Resource Recovery:** Even if the stock drops below cap/2 due to Defections, the natural growth of the resource can bring it back above the threshold in subsequent rounds, encouraging players to return to Cooperating behavior and stabilizing the system.

**Answer:**

To sustainably manage the shared resource while maximizing individual payoffs, each player should follow this strategy:

- **Cooperate:** If the current stock is greater than half of its maximum capacity (cap/2), consume a smaller share equal to cap divided by twice the number of players (cap/(2n)).
- **Defect:** If the current stock is less than or equal to half of its maximum capacity, consume a larger share equal to cap divided by the number of players (cap/n).

This approach ensures that the resource remains stable when all Cooperate and adjusts dynamically if any player defects, preventing irreversible depletion while allowing for optimal individual gains.

$\boxed{\text{If current stock > } \frac{\text{cap}}{2}: \text{Consume } \frac{\text{cap}}{2n}; \text{Else: Consume } \frac{\text{cap}}{n}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_379 = '''
To address the problem, we'll implement a strategy where each player initially cooperates. They then monitor the current stock level relative to a threshold (75% of capacity). If the stock falls below this threshold, players switch to defecting to maximize their immediate gain before potential resource depletion.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to encourage others to maintain the resource.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: Track the current stock relative to a predefined threshold (75% of capacity).
3. **Adjust Strategy Based on Threshold**:
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above or equal to 75% of capacity.
   - Defect if the current stock falls below this threshold, indicating over-exploitation.

This approach balances sustainability with immediate gain, adapting based on observed resource levels without requiring communication between players.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(last_actions, own_history, scores, payoffs, possible_actions):
    capacity = 100  # Assuming capacity is 100; adjust if necessary
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # 75% of capacity
    
    # Get current stock from the environment (assuming it's accessible)
    # For simulation purposes, we might track this ourselves or have it provided.
    # Here, we'll assume 'current_stock' is a variable that holds the latest stock value.
    # In reality, you'd need to retrieve this from the game state.
    current_stock = get_current_stock()  # Hypothetical function
    
    if current_stock >= threshold:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable environment.
- **Threshold Monitoring**: By checking against the threshold (75% of capacity), players decide whether to continue cooperating or switch to defecting. This helps maintain the resource when possible and maximizes personal gain when over-exploitation is detected.
- **Adaptability**: The strategy adapts dynamically based on observed stock levels, ensuring it remains effective even as other players' behaviors change.

This approach provides a balance between long-term sustainability and short-term gains, making it robust against various opponent strategies.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

This strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection based on the current state of the stock and historical cooperation rates, ensuring adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Evaluate the stock level and historical cooperation rates to decide between Cooperation (C) or Defection (D).

3. **Growth Mode (Stock > 75% of Capacity):**
   - Look at cooperation rates in the last two rounds.
   - If both rounds had more than 60% Cooperators, cooperate.
   - Otherwise, defect.

4. **Recovery Mode (25% < Stock ≤ 75% of Capacity):**
   - Consider the average cooperation rate over the last five rounds or since the stock dropped below 75%.
   - If the average is above 60%, cooperate.
   - Otherwise, defect.

5. **Conservation Mode (Stock ≤ 25% of Capacity):**
   - Regardless of previous actions, always cooperate to prevent further depletion and encourage resource recovery.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, cooperation_history):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if len(cooperation_history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    # Determine current state based on stock level
    if stock > 0.75 * capacity:
        mode = 'Growth'
    elif stock <= 0.25 * capacity:
        mode = 'Conservation'
    else:
        mode = 'Recovery'
    
    # Decision-making based on mode and cooperation history
    if mode == 'Conservation':
        return 'C'
    elif mode == 'Growth':
        recent_rounds = cooperation_history[-2:]
        avg_coop_last_two = sum(recent_rounds) / len(recent_rounds)
        if avg_coop_last_two > 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # Recovery Mode
        lookback = min(5, len(cooperation_history))
        recent_coops = cooperation_history[-lookback:]
        avg_coop_recent = sum(recent_coops) / len(recent_coops)
        if avg_coop_recent > 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a positive example.
- **Last Rounds (if known):** If near the end, focus on maximizing immediate payoffs while considering the stock's recovery potential.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Maintain flexible strategies but encourage cooperation when possible.

This strategy dynamically adapts to the game's state and opponents' behaviors, promoting sustainability and mutual benefits by balancing short-term gains with long-term resource preservation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_381 = '''
**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

Our strategy aims to maximize each player's total payoff by balancing immediate gains with sustainable resource management. It adapts dynamically based on the stock level and opponents' actions, without assuming prior coordination.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin with cooperation in the first round to maintain a healthy stock for future rounds.
2. **Threshold-Based Adaptation:**
   - **Cooperate** if the current stock is above a dynamically adjusted threshold that considers the number of players and past consumption patterns.
   - **Defect** when the stock falls below this threshold, indicating potential resource depletion or excessive defection by others.
3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Adjust the cooperation threshold based on historical data:
   - Increase cooperation if the stock remains stable or grows, encouraging sustainability.
   - Decrease cooperation (i.e., increase defecting) if the stock declines sharply, indicating others are defecting excessively.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to establish a foundation for future rounds.
- **Last Round:** Balance between defecting for immediate gain and cooperating to avoid excessive depletion. Use a cautious approach, considering potential collective outcomes.
- **Stock Collapse Scenario:** If the stock is critically low, prioritize immediate gains by defecting to maximize current payoff before the resource collapses.

### Implementation Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, history):
    # Initialize threshold based on capacity and number of players
    n = number_of_players
    initial_threshold = capacity * 0.8  # Starting point for cooperation
    
    if it's the first round:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate historical consumption impact
    recent_consumption = average_past_consumption(history)
    threshold = adjust_threshold(initial_threshold, recent_consumption)
    
    if stock_level > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def adjust_threshold(initial_threshold, recent_consumption):
    # Increase cooperation threshold if past actions indicate sustainable play
    if recent_consumption < expected_coop_consumption:
        return initial_threshold * 1.05  # Encourage more cooperation
    else:
        return initial_threshold * 0.95  # Discourage cooperation, encourage defection

def handle_last_round(stock_level):
    # Balance between defecting and maintaining some resource for potential future rounds (though none exist)
    if stock_level > capacity * 0.5:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# In practice, the decision would integrate these components dynamically.
```

### Summary:

- **Adaptive Threshold:** Starts with a high cooperation threshold, adjusting based on historical consumption and stock trends.
- **Reciprocity Mechanism:** Encourages cooperation when others do, defects when others defect excessively.
- **Edge Case Management:** Explicit rules for the first and last rounds to handle unique scenarios without assuming coordination.

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to maintain collective resource health while responding to opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_382 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Start with Cooperate (C) in the first round as the stock is at maximum capacity, promoting sustainable consumption.

2. **Monitoring Stock Levels:**
   - Track the stock level after each round to assess its trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable).

3. **Adaptive Behavior Based on Stock Trends:**
   - **Growing Stock:** Continue Cooperating to sustain growth and maximize future payoffs.
   - **Stable Stock:** Maintain a mix of Cooperation and Defection, adjusting based on others' actions.
   - **Declining Stock:** Increase Defection (D) to encourage others to cooperate more, signaling the need for sustainability.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
   - **Last Few Rounds (r-2, r-1, r):** Shift towards Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs as there's no future impact.

5. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   - Foster cooperation by signaling through actions—defect when others over-consume to prompt a shift towards sustainability.

6. **Dynamic Adjustment Mechanisms:**
   - Use feedback loops, adjusting each round based on past outcomes and opponents' behaviors.

7. **Consideration of Payoff Trends:**
   - Balance immediate payoffs from defection with the need for long-term stock health, avoiding actions that lead to depletion.

8. **Testing Hypothetical Scenarios:**
   - Prepare for scenarios where all defect; respond by maximizing immediate gains in later rounds.

9. **Balancing Immediate and Future Payoffs:**
   - Find an equilibrium between current gains and future sustainability, ensuring maximum total payoff over all rounds.

10. **Thresholds for Action:**
    - If the stock drops below a certain percentage of capacity (e.g., 50%), increase defection to salvage resources or incentivize cooperation.

**Implementation Steps:**

- **Initial Phase:** Cooperate in the first round.
- **Mid-Game Adjustments:** Monitor stock trends; adjust between C and D based on whether the stock is growing, stable, or declining.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Defect more in the last few rounds to maximize immediate payoffs.

This strategy balances cooperation for sustainability with adaptive defection when necessary, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_383 = '''
To address the problem of sustaining a common resource through cooperative strategies among players, we can employ a structured approach based on thresholds and hysteresis. This method ensures that cooperation continues when the resource level is sufficient but allows for defection to prevent collapse when levels drop too low.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Thresholds:**
   - **Upper Threshold (T_high):** Set at 80% of the maximum capacity. Players will cooperate as long as the current stock is above this threshold.
   - **Lower Threshold (T_low):** Set at 60% of the maximum capacity. If the stock drops below this, players will defect to take more now while risking future depletion.

2. **Hysteresis Effect:**
   - Between T_high and T_low, players continue with their previous strategy (cooperate if they did last round, defect otherwise). This prevents rapid switching between strategies, which can destabilize the system.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Monitor Current Stock:** In each round, assess the current level of the resource.
2. **Apply Thresholds:**
   - If **Current Stock >= T_high (80%)**, all players cooperate.
   - If **Current Stock <= T_low (60%)**, all players defect.
3. **Between Thresholds:** Maintain the previous action:
   - If last round was cooperation, continue to cooperate.
   - If last round was defection, continue to defect.

### Rationale:
- **Cooperation Above T_high:** Ensures sustainable use of the resource when levels are healthy, allowing growth and maintaining stability.
- **Defection Below T_low:** Prevents catastrophic depletion by encouraging players to take more while the resource is still available, signaling a need for reset or recovery.
- **Hysteresis Between Thresholds:** Provides stability by avoiding abrupt changes in strategy, giving the system time to recover without oscillations.

### Example Walkthrough:
Consider a common pool with maximum capacity of 100 units and n=4 players.

- **Round 1: Stock = 100**
  - >=80 → Cooperate. Each takes 25 (total 100). Growth occurs, stock remains at 100.
  
- **Round 2: Stock = 90**
  - <80 but >60 → Follow previous action (cooperate). Each takes 22.5 (total 90). Remaining 10 allows growth to ~100 again.

- **Round X: Stock drops to 70 due to some defection**
  - Between 60 and 80 → Continue cooperation. Growth brings stock back above 80.

- **Round Y: Stock plummets to 50 due to widespread defection**
  - <=60 → Defect. Each takes maximum possible, leading to rapid depletion but signaling the need for a new cooperative phase once the resource recovers.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and allowing for necessary adjustments when resources are strained.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_384 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to balance long-term sustainability with short-term gains by dynamically adjusting cooperation based on the stock's health and trends. Here's a structured breakdown:

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate:** When the current stock is above 75% of capacity and has been stable or increasing over recent rounds.
   - **Defect:** If the stock drops below 40% of capacity or shows significant decline despite previous cooperation.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a sustainable base.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds):** Defect more to exploit remaining resources, as future gains from cooperation are limited.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds:**
   - Use moving averages or trends to adjust thresholds adaptively, ensuring responsiveness to others' actions and stock dynamics.

4. **Rationale:**
   - Promotes sustainability when the resource is healthy.
   - Encourages exploitation when the stock is at risk of collapse, preventing prolonged depletion.
   - Balances individual gains with collective needs through adaptive behavior.

This strategy ensures players respond to changing conditions, fostering a balance between cooperation and defection for robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_385 = '''
**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate unconditionally.
   - **Rationale:** Sets a positive precedent, encouraging mutual cooperation and maintaining resource stability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (From Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Dynamic Threshold (T) Calculation:**
     - If current stock (S) > 80% of capacity:
       - Set T = 70% (cooperation rate needed).
     - If S ≤ 80% of capacity:
       - Set T = 50% (lower threshold to encourage cooperation despite resource stress).

   - **Assessment Period:**
     - Consider the last k rounds (k=3 or k=5) to focus on recent behavior.

   - **Cooperation Rate Calculation:**
     - Compute the average cooperation rate of other players over the assessment period.

   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If average cooperation rate ≥ T:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Defect to respond to widespread defection and incentivize future cooperation.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect regardless of history or stock level.
   - **Rationale:** In the final round, there's no future punishment for defection, so players might as well defect for maximum payoff.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - **Stock Stability:**
     - When the stock is stable (near capacity), cooperation is maintained to prevent depletion.
   - **Resource Stress:**
     - Lower thresholds during resource stress encourage continued cooperation despite challenges.

5. **Adjustments and Considerations:**
   - **Oscillation Prevention:**
     - Use a higher threshold (e.g., 80%) for returning to cooperation after defection phases to prevent rapid shifts.
   - **Recent Behavior Focus:**
     - Emphasize recent rounds to adapt quickly to changing player strategies.

This strategy balances initial cooperation with responsive behavior, adjusting thresholds dynamically based on resource levels. It aims to maintain stable cooperation while effectively responding to defections, ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_386 = '''
**Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Response (ACDR)**

**Objective:** To maximize cumulative payoffs by promoting sustainable resource use through cooperation while adapting to defector behaviors.

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets a positive precedent and encourages others to maintain the stock for long-term gains.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Evaluate two factors from the previous round:
     - **Majority Action:** Whether more than half of the players Cooperated.
     - **Stock Trend:** If the stock increased or remained stable compared to the previous round.
   - **Action Decision:**
     - **Cooperate (C):** If both conditions are met (majority Cooperated and stock is stable/increasing).
     - **Defect (D):** If either condition fails (defectors are in majority or stock decreased).

3. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - Shift strategy to maximize immediate payoff:
     - Defect (D) if it leads to higher personal gain, as there's no future impact from resource depletion.

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to foster initial sustainability.
- **Last Round(s):** Focus on maximizing individual gain, possibly defecting despite potential long-term harm since future rounds don't exist.

### **Collective Mindset Alignment:**

ACDR promotes a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability. By rewarding cooperation with continued resource health and punishing defection through reciprocal defection, it encourages mutual cooperation and adaptability.

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def ACDR_strategy(player_index, history, current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Extract previous actions from history
    prev_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    
    # Determine majority action in the previous round
    num_players = len(prev_actions)
    cooperate_count = sum(1 for a in prev_actions if a == 'C')
    majority_cooperate = cooperate_count > num_players / 2
    
    # Check stock trend from last round to current round
    last_stock = history[-1]['stock_after']
    stock_increased = current_stock >= last_stock
    
    # Decision logic
    if majority_cooperate and stock_increased:
        return 'C'  # Continue Cooperating
    else:
        return 'D'  # Defect to encourage cooperation or respond to declining stock

    # Handle final rounds separately
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        # In last 10% of rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoff
        return 'D'
```

### **Rationale:**

ACDR starts by Cooperating to build a sustainable resource base. It then adapts based on others' actions and the stock's health, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to reset behaviors or maximize gains in final rounds. This balance encourages collective cooperation while being resilient against defectors and changing conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_387 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategic approach that balances individual gain with collective sustainability. The strategy is designed to adapt dynamically based on observed actions and current stock levels, encouraging cooperation while deterring excessive defection.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to follow suit and maintain a healthy stock level.
2. **Dynamic Decision Making**: In each subsequent round, decide whether to cooperate or defect based on:
   - The number of defectors in previous rounds.
   - The current stock level relative to predefined thresholds.
3. **Threshold-Based Adjustments**:
   - Cooperate if the stock is above a high threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity) and defection rates are low.
   - Defect if the stock drops below a medium threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) or if there's significant past defection to signal disapproval and encourage cooperation.
4. **Final Rounds Adjustment**: In the last few rounds, maintain cooperation if the stock is healthy to maximize individual payoffs without worrying about future consequences.

### Detailed Decision Rules

1. **First Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate
     - Aims to set a positive example and sustain the resource for subsequent rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-2)**:
   - Calculate metrics:
     - `stock_level`: Current stock.
     - `defectors_prev_rounds`: Number of defectors in previous rounds.
   - Determine thresholds:
     - High threshold: e.g., 0.9 * capacity
     - Medium threshold: e.g., 0.5 * capacity
     - Defection rate threshold: e.g., 30% of players defecting in the last round.
   - **Decision Logic**:
     - If `stock_level` > High threshold and `defectors_prev_rounds` < Defection rate threshold:
       - Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
     - Else if `stock_level` between Medium and High thresholds and moderate defection:
       - Cooperate, trusting others will follow suit.
     - Else if `stock_level` < Medium threshold or high defection rates:
       - Defect to signal dissatisfaction and encourage others to cooperate.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Round r-1 and r)**:
   - If the stock is above a certain level (e.g., 80% of capacity):
     - Cooperate to ensure maximum payoff without exploiting the resource.
   - If the stock is low:
     - Consider defecting as there's no future punishment.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```pseudocode
function decide_action(player_i, current_stock, history, round_number):
    n = total_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    r = total_rounds

    # Determine thresholds based on the number of players and capacity
    high_threshold = 0.9 * capacity
    medium_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    defection_rate_threshold = 0.3 * n  # 30% of players defecting

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate number of defectors in previous rounds
        last_round_actions = history[-1]
        num_defectors_last_round = sum(1 for action in last_round_actions.values() if action == 'D')

        # Check stock level and defection rate
        if current_stock > high_threshold and num_defectors_last_round <= defection_rate_threshold:
            return 'C'
        elif medium_threshold <= current_stock <= high_threshold:
            # Consider past cooperation trends
            recent_coop = count_coop(history[-2:])
            if recent_coop >= (n - defection_rate_threshold):
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            return 'D'

    # Additional logic for last few rounds
    if round_number > r - 2:
        if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Robustness and Adaptability

- **Adaptation**: The strategy adapts to different behaviors by adjusting based on observed defection rates and stock levels, ensuring sustainability without relying on coordination.
- **Feedback Loop**: By defecting in response to high defection rates, the strategy incentivizes cooperation and prevents resource depletion.

This approach ensures a balance between individual payoff maximization and collective resource management, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while promoting sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_388 = '''
To address the problem, we need a strategy that balances maintaining the shared resource while maximizing individual payoff. The approach involves observing the current state of the resource and adapting actions accordingly.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to maintain the resource level high.
2. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - If the stock is above 70% of capacity, continue Cooperating as it indicates a healthy resource with others likely contributing.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains.
3. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last few rounds (specifically the last two), always Defect to maximize payoff since there's no future impact.

This strategy ensures that we contribute when resources are abundant and defect when they become scarce or near the game's conclusion.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_round, total_rounds, capacity, stock_history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Check if in the last two rounds
    if current_round >= total_rounds - 2 and current_round <= total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    
    # Get previous round's stock after consumption and growth
    prev_stock = stock_history[-1] if stock_history else capacity
    
    if prev_stock > 0.7 * capacity:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Round**: The first move is to Cooperate, fostering a cooperative environment.
- **Stock Monitoring**: By checking the previous round's stock level, we gauge whether others are contributing (high stock) or defecting (low stock).
- **Threshold-Based Decision**: A threshold of 70% capacity helps decide between Cooperation and Defection. This balance ensures sustainable use when possible and opportunistic gains when necessary.
- **Endgame Adjustment**: Switching to Defect in the final rounds capitalizes on immediate payoffs without concern for future rounds.

This approach efficiently balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically based on observed resource levels and game progression.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_389 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Conditional Cooperation**

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to establish a positive precedent and maintain a high initial stock for growth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Monitoring**: Track the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - **Recent History Analysis**: Examine the actions of other players in the last few rounds (e.g., last 3) to gauge cooperation levels.
     - Calculate a cooperation ratio by counting Cooperate actions and dividing by total possible actions.
   - **Decision Making**:
     - If stock is above a high threshold (e.g., 90% capacity) and cooperation ratio exceeds a set threshold, continue Cooperating.
     - If stock drops below a low threshold (e.g., 30%) or cooperation ratio falls below another threshold, switch to Defecting.
   - **Final Rounds**: In the last few rounds, prioritize immediate gains by defecting since there's no future punishment.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds and Adaptation**:
   - Use dynamic thresholds adjusted based on rounds remaining and stock levels.
   - Incorporate a buffer zone around thresholds to prevent volatility and include smoothing functions for transitions.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - In the first round, default to Cooperate.
   - Near the end of the game, defect to maximize immediate payoffs.
   - If the stock is exactly at a threshold or rounds are near completion, apply predefined rules to maintain stability.

5. **Learning and Adaptation**:
   - Balance between individual gains and collective sustainability.
   - Use a weighted average of recent actions to avoid predictable patterns and adapt smoothly to changes.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
for each round:
    if first round:
        choose Cooperate
    else:
        stock_level = current_stock
        history = get_last_3_rounds_actions()
        count_coop = sum(actions for player in history)
        total_actions = n * 3
        cooperation_ratio = count_coop / total_actions

        if stock_level > high_threshold and cooperation_ratio > threshold_ratio:
            choose Cooperate
        elif stock_level < low_threshold or cooperation_ratio < defect_threshold:
            choose Defect
        else:
            if rounds_remaining <= final_rounds:
                choose Defect
            else:
                if random() < adaptation_prob:
                    choose opposite of previous choice
                else:
                    follow current trend based on cooperation_ratio
```

This strategy balances between maintaining a sustainable resource level and preventing exploitation, ensuring adaptability to various opponent behaviors while prioritizing collective long-term benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_390 = '''
To address the problem of balancing cooperation and defection in a repeated interaction where the goal is to maximize personal gain while ensuring resource sustainability, we propose an adaptive strategy. This strategy dynamically adjusts behavior based on observable changes in the resource (stock) level and its trend over time.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Phase:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative baseline to encourage others to also cooperate, promoting sustainable resource use.

2. **Middle Phases:**
   - **Monitor Stock Level and Trend:**
     - Track the current stock level and its trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable) over recent rounds.
   - **Decision Based on Stock Level:**
     - **If Current Stock > 80% of Capacity:**
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
         - **Rationale:** High stock indicates sustainable resource use; continue cooperating to maintain this state.
     - **If 50% < Current Stock ≤ 80%:**
       - Calculate a probability `p` to cooperate, where `p = (S - 50%) / (30%)`. This creates a sliding scale from 0 to 1 as the stock moves from 50% to 80%.
       - **Action:** Cooperate with probability `p`, else Defect.
         - **Rationale:** Balance between cooperation and defection, leaning more towards cooperation when closer to 80%.
     - **If Current Stock ≤ 50%:**
       - **Action:** Defect.
         - **Rationale:** Low stock indicates potential resource depletion; defecting maximizes immediate gains.

3. **Endgame Phase:**
   - **As Remaining Rounds Decrease (e.g., last 20% of total rounds):**
     - **Adjustment:** Increase tendency to defect, as there's less future payoff to lose.
     - **Action:** Always Defect in the final round(s) to maximize immediate gain.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - After each round, update the stock trend analysis (e.g., using a moving average over the last few rounds).
   - If the stock is decreasing despite cooperation attempts, increase the defection tendency.
   - If the stock recovers or shows an upward trend, reconsider increasing cooperative behavior.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to encourage others.
   - **Last Round(s):** Switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gain without concern for future rounds.

### Formal Strategy:

For each round after the first:
1. If current stock (S) > 80% of capacity:
   - Cooperate
2. Else if 50% < S ≤ 80%:
   - Calculate probability `p = (S - 50%) / (30%)`
     - Choose Cooperate with probability `p`, else Defect
3. Else (S ≤ 50%):
   - Defect

This strategy balances cooperation when resources are abundant and sustainable, while adaptively defecting as resources deplete or trends indicate others are defecting more frequently. It ensures a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability, adjusting dynamically to observed changes in the resource level.

### Final Answer:

The proposed strategy is an adaptive approach that begins with cooperation, monitors resource levels, and adjusts behavior based on stock trends and thresholds. Here's the step-by-step decision-making process encapsulated succinctly:

1. **Initial Round:** Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If current stock > 80% capacity: Cooperate.
   - If 50% < current stock ≤ 80%: Cooperate with probability `(current stock - 50%) / 30%`, else Defect.
   - If current stock ≤ 50%: Defect.
3. **Endgame Adjustment:** In the last few rounds, increase defection tendency to maximize immediate gains.

This strategy is designed to maximize personal gain while encouraging sustainable resource use when possible, adapting dynamically to collective behavior inferred from observable changes in the resource level.

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Thresholds**

1. **Initialization:**
   - In the first round, Cooperate (C) to signal willingness to sustain the resource and build a cooperative environment.
   - Set dynamic thresholds:
     - `high_threshold` = 0.8 * capacity
     - `low_threshold` = 0.5 * capacity
   - Maintain a window of recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5) to track opponents' defect rates.

2. **For Rounds t from 2 to r-1:**
   - Observe the current stock level (`S_t`) and calculate:
     - Recent defect rate = (number of defects in last k rounds) / k
   - Decision Rules:
     - If `S_t` > `high_threshold`: Cooperate.
     - If `S_t` < `low_threshold`: Defect to exploit remaining resources.
     - If recent defect rate > 0.5: Switch to Defecting (D).
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).

3. **Adjust Thresholds Dynamically:**
   - After each round, update thresholds based on observed growth and consumption patterns:
     - If stock recovery is poor despite cooperation, decrease `high_threshold`.
     - If defects are leading to rapid depletion, lower `low_threshold` more aggressively.

4. **Last Round (r):**
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff with no future rounds to consider.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Rounds:** Use a smaller window (e.g., last 2-3 rounds) for defect rate assessment due to limited history.
   - **Stock Recovery:** If stock grows significantly after cooperation, reset thresholds to encourage continued sustainability.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def strategy(current_stock, round_number, r, capacity, recent_defects_window):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    recent_defect_rate = sum(recent_defects_window) / len(recent_defects_window)
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < low_threshold:
        return 'D'
    elif recent_defect_rate > 0.5:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# For the last round, always defect
if round_number == r:
    return 'D'
```

**Conclusion:**

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adapting to current stock levels and opponents' behaviors. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection when necessary to prevent resource collapse or exploit remaining resources effectively.

**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase:**
   - Cooperate during the first 20% of rounds (initial_coop_rounds = r/5) to encourage a cooperative environment and allow the stock to stabilize or grow.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptive Response:**
   - After the initial phase, evaluate the current stock level:
     - If stock > 80% of capacity (high_threshold), continue Cooperating as it's sustainable.
     - If stock < 20% of capacity (low_threshold), switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains.
   - Between 20-80% stock level, assess recent behavior:
     - Calculate the proportion of recent defectors. If more than 30% of players have been defecting in the last few rounds, respond by defecting.
     - Monitor if the stock is decreasing rapidly; if so, switch to Defecting.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds (r/10), prioritize maximizing immediate gains by defecting.
   - If the stock drops too low in earlier rounds, adjust to start defecting earlier.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate without hesitation to encourage others.
   - **Last Round:** Definitely Defect as there's no future benefit.
   - **Stock Collapse:** If the stock is very low (below 20%), switch to always Defecting as recovery is unlikely.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, stock, capacity, r, n):
    initial_coop = r // 5
    
    if current_round <= initial_coop:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
        low_threshold = 0.2 * capacity
        
        if stock > high_threshold:
            return Cooperate
        elif stock < low_threshold:
            return Defect
        else:
            recent_defectors = count_defectors_in_last_rounds()
            defector_ratio = recent_defectors / n
            
            if defector_ratio >= 0.3 or is_stock_decreasing_rapidly():
                return Defect
            else:
                return Cooperate
                
def endgame_strategy(current_round, r):
    if current_round > (r - r // 10):
        return Defect
```

This strategy balances encouraging cooperation while adapting to others' behavior and endgame scenarios, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies.

To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource level while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a cooperative strategy based on a dynamic threshold. The strategy balances cooperation with defection based on the current state of the resource.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, all players Cooperate to maintain the maximum resource level (capacity). This ensures that the resource starts at its peak value, providing a stable foundation for subsequent rounds.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Decision-Making:** For each subsequent round, players assess the current stock of the resource relative to the capacity. If the stock is above 75% of the capacity, players Cooperate; otherwise, they Defect. This threshold is chosen to provide a buffer that allows for some depletion while still ensuring potential recovery through growth.

3. **Growth and Sustainability:** When players Cooperate, the total consumption is minimized, allowing the resource to recover and grow in subsequent rounds. The growth formula ensures that as long as the stock remains above 75%, the system can sustainably replenish itself.

4. **Response to Depletion:** If the stock falls below 75% due to Defectors or external factors, all players switch to Defecting. This collective action prevents further sustainable recovery but reflects a necessary response when cooperation is no longer viable for maintaining the resource.

**Answer:**

Each player should follow this strategy:

- In the first round, Cooperate.
- In each subsequent round:
  - If the current stock of the resource is greater than 75% of its capacity, Cooperate.
  - Otherwise, Defect.

This approach ensures a balance between maintaining the resource's sustainability and maximizing individual payoffs. The strategy promotes cooperation when possible and switches to defection only when necessary to prevent resource collapse.

**Final Answer:**

Each player should Cooperate in the first round and continue Cooperating as long as the current stock is above 75% of capacity; otherwise, they should Defect. This strategy is encapsulated in the following decision rule:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S > 0.75 \times \text{capacity}; \text{otherwise, Defect}}

To address the problem of deciding when to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in a repeated game with perfect information about past actions and the current stock level, we propose a strategy that balances sustainability with immediate payoff maximization. The strategy adapts based on the game's progress, the stock's health, and the behavior of other players.

### Approach
1. **Early Game Strategy**: Cooperate initially to build or maintain a healthy stock level.
2. **Mid-Game Strategy**: Monitor the stock level and recent cooperation trends among players. Cooperate if the stock is sufficiently high and others are mostly Cooperating; otherwise, Defect.
3. **Late Game Strategy**: Increase the tendency to Defect as future payoffs become less significant. However, continue Cooperating if the stock remains healthy and others are Cooperating.
4. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust cooperation/defection decisions based on observed trends in stock levels and recent player behavior.

### Explanation
- **Early Game**: The strategy starts by Cooperating to encourage a sustainable resource base.
- **Mid-Game**: It evaluates the current stock level and recent player behavior. If the stock is healthy and others are mostly Cooperating, it continues to Cooperate; otherwise, it defects to avoid exploitation.
- **Late Game**: As future rounds become fewer, the strategy leans towards Defecting more to maximize immediate payoffs, but still considers continuing to Cooperate if the stock remains robust.

This approach dynamically adjusts based on the game's progression and players' actions, aiming to balance long-term sustainability with short-term gains.

**Strategy Description: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initialization**:
   - In the first round, Cooperate to establish a baseline for sustainability.

2. **Decision Rules for Rounds 2 to r-2**:
   - **High Stock (Above 80% of Capacity)**: Cooperate to maintain sustainable resource levels.
   - **Moderate Stock (50%-80%)**: Assess recent cooperation rates among other players over the last three rounds.
     - If majority (>50%) have Cooperated, continue Cooperating to support sustainability.
     - Otherwise, Defect to prevent exploitation and encourage others to Cooperate in future rounds.
   - **Low Stock (20%-50%)**: Evaluate stock trend.
     - If stock has been decreasing for the last two rounds, Defect to exploit remaining resources before potential collapse.
     - If stable or increasing, cautiously Cooperate.
   - **Very Low Stock (<20%)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff as resource nears depletion.

3. **Final Rounds (r-1 and r)**:
   - Defect to secure maximum possible payoff in the last rounds without concern for future sustainability.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Sudden stock drops due to many Defectors: Consider defecting temporarily until stock stabilizes or recovers.
   - Stock exactly at capacity: Cooperate to maintain health.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection, encouraging sustainable resource use while responding to exploitation and resource depletion trends. It is robust against various opponent behaviors by dynamically adjusting based on current conditions and historical actions.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with adaptive defection based on the game's dynamics and stock levels. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy begins with cooperation to encourage sustainability and observes the resource's behavior over rounds. It adapts by defecting when the resource shows signs of depletion, ensuring both immediate gains and future sustainability.

---

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate in the first round.
     - **Rationale:** Establishes a sustainable baseline and encourages others to cooperate.

2. **Adaptive Defection Based on Stock Trends:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track the stock after each round.
   - **Threshold (T):** Set T as 60% of capacity (e.g., T = 0.6 * capacity).
     - If stock > T, continue Cooperating.
     - If stock ≤ T or shows a decreasing trend, switch to Defecting.

3. **Responsive Strategy:**
   - **Analyze Trends:** Observe whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable over several rounds.
     - **Increasing/ Stable Stock:** Continue Cooperating.
     - **Decreasing Stock:** Increase defection frequency to maximize immediate gains and prevent further depletion.

4. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - **Action:** Defect in the last round.
     - **Rationale:** Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

---

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **All Cooperate:** Strategy continues Cooperating, maintaining sustainability.
- **Some Defectors:** Detects stock dip and adjusts by defecting to protect against depletion.
- **First Round Adjustment:** No history; cooperation sets a positive precedent.

---

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, game_history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity
    T = 0.6 * capacity  # Threshold for sustainable cooperation
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate stock trend from past rounds
        recent_stocks = [round['stock'] for round in game_history[-3:]]
        avg_stock_change = (current_stock - recent_stocks[0]) / len(recent_stocks)
        
        if current_stock > T and avg_stock_change >= 0:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # Handle last round separately
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
```

---

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts by Cooperating to foster a sustainable resource base.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Uses the threshold T and trend analysis to decide between C and D, ensuring adaptability.
- **Responsive Strategy:** Adjusts behavior based on observed trends, protecting against depletion and maximizing gains.
- **Final Round Adjustment:** Defects in the last round to prioritize immediate payoff.

This strategy effectively balances cooperation for sustainability with adaptive defection when necessary, ensuring robust performance across varying player behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_397 = '''
To address the problem, we developed a strategy that adapts based on the observed state of the shared resource over time. The approach focuses on maintaining cooperation while ensuring the sustainability of the resource.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Round:** Start by cooperating to encourage others and maintain the resource for future rounds.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (except last):**
   - Calculate the total consumption in the previous round using the change in stock.
   - Track the trend of the stock level over time.
   - If the stock remains above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), continue cooperating to support sustainable use.
   - If the stock is consistently below the threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains before the resource depletes further.
3. **Last Round:** Defect to secure the highest possible payoff in the final round since there are no future consequences.

### Implementation Steps:

1. Observe the initial stock level and start by cooperating.
2. After each round, calculate the total consumption by analyzing the change in stock (from S to S_new).
3. Use a moving average of the past few rounds' stock levels to determine trends.
4. Apply thresholds (e.g., 70%) to decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the observed trend and current stock level.
5. In the final round, defect to maximize payoff without concern for future impacts.

### Answer:

The optimal strategy involves dynamically adjusting cooperation based on the resource's state:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by cooperating to sustain the resource.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Track the stock level; if it remains above a threshold (e.g., 70%), continue cooperating. If it drops below, switch to defecting.
- **Final Round Defection:** Ensure maximum payoff in the last round by defecting.

This strategy balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection when necessary to maximize personal gain.

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_398 = '''
To address the challenge of sustainably managing a shared resource while optimizing individual payoffs, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy for Sustainable Resource Management

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Cooperate:** Start by contributing to the sustainability of the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 onwards):**
   - **Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
     - **Upper Threshold (X) = 80% of capacity:** If the current stock is above this level, continue to **Cooperate**.
     - **Lower Threshold (Y) = 60% of capacity:** If the current stock drops below this level, switch to **Defecting**.

3. **Middle Range Decision Making (When Y < Current Stock < X):**
   - **Trend Analysis:**
     - Calculate the average stock level over the last few rounds (e.g., 3-5 rounds).
     - If the current stock is higher than this average, indicating an upward trend towards sustainability, choose to **Cooperate**.
     - If the current stock is lower than the average, indicating a downward trend towards depletion, switch to **Defecting**.

### Explanation

This strategy balances between maintaining the resource for long-term benefits and responding to immediate conditions. By using thresholds (80% and 60%), it prevents drastic changes in behavior based on minor fluctuations. The middle range decision-making uses recent trends to adaptively choose actions, ensuring responsiveness without unnecessary oscillations.

### Example Walkthrough

- **Round 1:** Start with **Cooperate**, keeping the stock stable.
- **Round 2:** If others defect, leading to a drop below 80%, analyze the trend. If the stock is decreasing, switch to Defecting in future rounds until levels recover or sustainably manage.

This approach aims to maintain resource sustainability while allowing for strategic adjustments based on current conditions and trends.

The optimal strategy for players in this game involves starting with cooperation, monitoring stock levels and other players' actions, and adapting accordingly. Here is a detailed summary of the strategy:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to start sustainably.
2. **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.
3. **Middle Rounds**:
   - If the current stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity) and less than 30% of other players defected in the previous round, continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock drops below the critical threshold or more than 30% of other players defected in the previous round, switch to Defecting.

This strategy encourages cooperation when beneficial and adapts by defecting when necessary or in the final round. The key points are:

- Start with cooperation to maintain a healthy stock.
- Monitor both stock levels and others' actions to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
- Defect if the stock is too low or too many others defect, ensuring maximum payoff.

The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate in early rounds with healthy stocks; defect when necessary or in the last round.}}

description_COLLECTIVE_400 = '''
To address the problem of preventing resource depletion in a multi-player scenario where each player acts independently based on current information, we propose a refined strategy that balances cooperation and defection to maintain sustainable resource levels.

**Strategy: Threshold-Based Cooperation with Reciprocity**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of sustainability.
2. **Threshold Monitoring**: In each subsequent round:
   - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity and fewer than 25% of players Defected in the last round, continue Cooperating.
   - If either the stock drops below 75% or more than 25% of players Defected in the last round, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gain while signaling potential issues with cooperation.
3. **Recovery Check**: After defecting, monitor future rounds:
   - If in the next round, fewer than 10% of players Defect and the stock begins to recover (e.g., rises above 50%), revert to Cooperating to promote sustainability.
   - Continue Defecting if cooperation levels remain low or the stock continues to deplete significantly.

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages others to maintain sustainable practices by demonstrating willingness to share resources.
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Uses both resource levels and historical defection rates to decide actions. A high stock level (≥75%) indicates sustainability, while a low defection rate (<25%) suggests others are cooperating. If either condition fails, defecting becomes necessary to prevent further depletion.
- **Recovery Check**: After defecting, assess if cooperation has resumed sufficiently. A significant drop in defections and noticeable resource recovery signal that sustainable practices can be reinstated.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Start with Cooperate**: In Round 1, all players choose C.
2. **Assess Conditions Each Round**:
   - Check current stock relative to capacity (75% threshold).
   - Review previous round's defection rate (<25% to continue C).
3. **Adjust Strategy Accordingly**:
   - If conditions are met, Cooperate; else, Defect.
4. **Monitor for Recovery**: After defecting, check next rounds for improved cooperation and resource levels to decide if reverting to C is feasible.

This strategy aims to prevent premature defection that leads to resource crashes while encouraging sustainable practices when possible. By balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, it fosters a cooperative environment unless significant defection indicates the need for self-protection.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal independent strategy is to Cooperate initially and continue doing so as long as the current stock remains above 75% of capacity and fewer than 25% of players Defected in the last round. If either condition fails, switch to Defecting. After defecting, revert to Cooperating only if subsequent rounds show a significant decrease in defection rates (below 10%) and noticeable resource recovery.

Thus, the strategy is:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; continue Cooperating if stock ≥75% and last round's defection <25%; else Defect}}$

To address the problem, we developed a strategy that promotes cooperation while allowing defection under specific conditions. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to maintain the resource level.

2. **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff as there are no future rounds to consider.

3. **Conditional Cooperation in Intermediate Rounds**:
   - **Cooperation Check**: Evaluate if more than half of the players Cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Resource Check**: Ensure that after consumption in the previous round, the resource level remained above 50% of its capacity.
   
4. **Defection Trigger**: If either the cooperation rate is low or the resource level drops below the threshold, all players Defect to prevent further depletion and secure immediate gains.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy balances cooperation with necessary defection based on resource health and others' actions. Players Cooperate initially but defect if previous round cooperation was low or resources fell below 50% capacity. This approach aims to sustain the resource while allowing players to maximize their payoffs when conditions warrant defection.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate in all rounds except the last, where you defect. Additionally, cooperate only if more than half of the players cooperated in the previous round and the resource level after consumption was above 50% capacity; otherwise, defect.}}

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Punishment (ACDP)**

The ACDP strategy is designed for the Common Pool Resource Game to maximize collective payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability. It balances cooperation and defection based on current stock levels, past actions, and game dynamics.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to establish a baseline of sustainability and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Observe the previous round's total consumption, individual actions, and resulting stock level.
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate among players. If more than 50% cooperated, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect (D).

3. **Stock Thresholds:**
   - Define a critical stock threshold as 25% of capacity. If the stock drops below this threshold:
     - Defect in the next round to signal resource stress and encourage others to conserve.
   - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, cooperate to maintain abundance.

4. **Punishment for Defection:**
   - Track players who consistently defect. After three consecutive defections by a player, others may start defecting in response, creating a feedback loop to discourage over-consumption.

5. **Endgame Adjustment (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - As the game nears its end (last 10% of rounds), prioritize preventing stock collapse.
     - Cooperate more frequently to sustain the resource, even if it means slightly lower immediate payoffs.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def ACDP_strategy(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = game_capacity()

    # Initial round: cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check if in last 10% of rounds
    if round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        if current_stock > capacity * 0.25:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate from previous round
    prev_coop = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C') / n
    
    # Check stock thresholds
    critical_threshold = capacity * 0.25
    high_threshold = capacity * 0.75

    if current_stock < critical_threshold:
        return 'D'
    elif prev_coop > 0.5:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Track individual defection history
        defector_count = count_consistent_defectors(history)
        if defector_count / n > 0.3:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
def count_consistent_defectors(history):
    defectors = {}
    for player in range(n):
        defectors[player] = 0
    for round_actions in history:
        for i, action in enumerate(round_actions):
            if action == 'D':
                defectors[i] +=1
            else:
                defectors[i] = 0
    consistent_defectors = sum(1 for count in defectors.values() if count >=3)
    return consistent_defectors
```

### Summary:

The ACDP strategy begins with cooperation to build a sustainable resource base. It adapts by monitoring the stock level and players' actions, switching to defection when necessary to punish over-consumption or prevent resource collapse. In later rounds, it focuses on maintaining the resource to avoid endgame depletion. This approach balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, encouraging collective cooperation while deterring defection through strategic responses.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_403 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on the stock level and past player behaviors. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage resource sustainability.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
   - Use a dynamic threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) to determine cooperation.
   - If the stock remains above this threshold and most players have recently Cooperated, continue Cooperating.
3. **Adaptive Defection:** Switch to Defecting if the stock drops below the threshold or if there's significant defection observed among other players.
4. **Endgame Adjustment:** In the final rounds, defect to maximize personal payoff since future rounds no longer influence current decisions.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Few Rounds (Rounds 1-3):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Reasoning:** Encourage others to maintain the resource and observe their behavior.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Calculate Current Stock (S_t):** Determine if S_t is above a threshold, say 70% of capacity.
   - **Assess Recent Behavior:**
     - If in the last k rounds (e.g., 3), more than x% (e.g., 60%) of players Cooperated each round:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
       - **Reasoning:** Sustained cooperation indicates a healthy resource, encouraging continued contribution.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Defect
       - **Reasoning:** Others' defection threatens sustainability; defect to exploit while possible.

3. **Stock Below Threshold:**
   - If S_t < 70% of capacity:
     - **Action:** Defect
     - **Reasoning:** Resource is at risk; maximize personal gain before potential collapse.

4. **Last Few Rounds (Final 2-3 rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
   - **Reasoning:** No future consequences, so prioritize immediate payoff.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round Without History:** Cooperate to initiate positive behavior.
- **Stock Drop Despite Cooperation:** If the stock declines despite many Cooperators, adjust threshold or increase defection likelihood.
- **Rapid Stock Decline:** Aggressively defect if the resource rapidly depletes, indicating others are not maintaining it.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity  # Initial threshold
    
    if round_number <= 3:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in initial rounds
    
    recent_coop_proportion = calculate_recent_coop(history)
    
    if current_stock >= threshold and recent_coop_proportion > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if round_number >= total_rounds - 2:
            return 'D'  # Defect in last few rounds
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Summary:
This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on resource levels and observed behavior, promoting sustainability while protecting against exploitation. It dynamically adjusts to maintain long-term viability unless immediate exploitation is more beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_404 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, we'll implement a decision-making framework that considers both the current state of the shared resource (stock) and the behavior of other players. Here's how to approach it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Thresholds and Parameters
- **Sustainability Threshold:** Set at 70% of capacity. Cooperate if stock is above this threshold.
- **Endgame Threshold:** Apply in the last 10% of total rounds, where defecting maximizes immediate payoff.
- **Cooperation Rate:** Monitor other players' cooperation rate over the past 3 rounds.

### Step 2: Evaluate Current Round Context
1. Determine if it's within the last 10% of rounds:
   - If yes, defect to prioritize immediate gains.
   
2. Calculate other players' average cooperation rate in recent rounds:
   - Use a moving average of the past 3 rounds to gauge current trends.

### Step 3: Apply Decision Rules
- **If not in endgame and others cooperate >50%:**
  - Cooperate if stock >70%.
  
- **Else:**
  - Defect to maximize personal gain, especially when sustainability is at risk or others aren't cooperating.

### Final Strategy:
Cooperate only when it's beneficial for long-term sustainability and when other players are also cooperating. Otherwise, defect to capture immediate gains, particularly as the game nears its end.

**Answer:**

In each round, you should cooperate if all three conditions are met:

1. The current round is not among the last 10% of total rounds.
2. The average cooperation rate of other players in the past three rounds exceeds 50%.
3. The current stock level is above 70% of its capacity.

Otherwise, you should defect.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if not in last 10%, others' recent cooperation >50%, and stock >70%; else, defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_405 = '''
**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to Cooperate when the current stock exceeds 80% of capacity and Defect otherwise. This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, promoting cooperation during prosperous periods while allowing for higher payoffs when resources begin to diminish.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock > 80% of capacity; otherwise, Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_406 = '''
The proposed strategy is designed to encourage cooperation while adapting to the behavior of other players. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation levels based on stock health and inferred actions from others. Here's the structured approach:

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT)

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while maintaining a healthy resource level for sustainable benefits.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First few rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Establish trust and maintain the common pool's health to encourage others to cooperate.

2. **Midgame:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track the current stock relative to capacity.
   - **Infer Others' Behavior:** Calculate total consumption from previous rounds to estimate others' cooperation levels.
     - If inferred cooperation is low, adjust thresholds to reduce cooperation.
   - **Dynamic Thresholds:**
     - **Cooperate** if the stock is above a threshold (initially set at 60% of capacity).
     - **Defect** if below this threshold, especially as rounds progress.
   - **Adjust Thresholds:** Lower the threshold if the stock consistently decreases despite cooperation.

3. **Endgame (Last few rounds):**
   - **Evaluate Stock:**
     - If high, continue Cooperating to sustain future gains.
     - If low, consider Defecting to maximize immediate payoff before depletion.

**Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a positive trend.
- **Last Round:** Adjust based on current stock health; Cooperate if sustainable, otherwise Defect.
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock is near zero, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds to maximize remaining gains.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def strategy(history, current_stock, capacity, num_players):
    round_number = len(history)
    total_rounds = r  # Total rounds known

    if round_number == 0:
        return 'C'  # First round cooperation

    # Calculate inferred cooperation rate from previous rounds
    def infer_cooperation():
        inferred_coop = []
        for past_stock, action in history:
            if action == 'C':
                consumed = past_stock / (2 * num_players)
            else:
                consumed = past_stock / num_players
            total_consumed = sum(consumed for _ in range(num_players))
            remaining = max(0, past_stock - total_consumed)
            growth = 2 * remaining * (1 - remaining / capacity)
            new_stock = min(remaining + growth, capacity)
            # Infer others' actions based on stock change
            # Placeholder logic; actual implementation would require more detailed analysis
            return 0.5  # Example: 50% inferred cooperation

    cooperation_rate = infer_cooperation()

    if round_number < 5:
        return 'C'  # Early rounds: cooperate to build trust

    threshold = capacity * (0.6 - (cooperation_rate / 2))
    threshold = max(threshold, capacity * 0.4)  # Minimum threshold

    if current_stock > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Consider defecting more in later rounds
        if round_number > total_rounds - 5:
            return 'D' if current_stock < (capacity * 0.75) else 'C'
        return 'D'

# Example usage:
# history = [(stock_t-1, action), ...]
# decision = strategy(history, stock_current, capacity, num_players)
```

**Alignment with Collective Mindset:**

ACT promotes a balance between individual and collective benefits by initially encouraging cooperation to sustain the resource. As rounds progress, it adaptively adjusts based on observed behavior and stock levels, aiming to prevent resource depletion while ensuring fair payoffs for all players.

---

This strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors by dynamically adjusting actions based on observable data and inferred cooperation rates. It prioritizes long-term sustainability without relying on explicit communication or coordination mechanisms.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_407 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a collective strategy that balances cooperation with adaptability to maintain resource sustainability. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

1. **Initial Rounds**: Players begin by Cooperating to build or maintain the stock level, setting a positive precedent.

2. **Threshold Calculation**: A dynamic threshold determines whether players Cooperate or Defect:
   - **Base Threshold**: Calculated as `(2 * current_stock) / capacity`.
   - **Adjusted Threshold**: Modified based on rounds remaining: `base_threshold * (1 - (current_round / total_rounds))`.

3. **Decision Rule**:
   - If the stock is above the adjusted threshold, players Cooperate.
   - If below, they Defect.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: The threshold adapts to prevent resource depletion and accounts for endgame effects as rounds progress.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, current_round, total_rounds):
    # Calculate base threshold considering stock relative to capacity
    base_threshold = (2 * stock) / capacity
    
    # Adjust threshold based on remaining rounds; lower threshold towards the end
    adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * (1 - (current_round / total_rounds))
    
    # Decision rule: Cooperate if stock is above the adjusted threshold, else Defect
    return 'C' if stock > adjusted_threshold else 'D'
```

### Strategy Justification

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with a cooperative stance to sustain resource levels and encourage mutual benefits.
- **Dynamic Thresholding**: Adjusts based on current stock and remaining rounds, preventing over-exploitation and adapting to endgame scenarios.
- **Adaptability**: Encourages players to switch strategies dynamically in response to changing conditions, fostering resilience against various opponent behaviors.

This strategy promotes a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability, aligning with the collective goal of preserving the common pool resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_408 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game aims to promote sustainable cooperation while adapting to changes in player behavior and resource levels. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by considering both historical cooperation rates and current stock levels. Here's the structured approach:

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets a positive precedent and helps maintain the initial high stock level.

2. **Last Round:**
   - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, Cooperate to ensure fair distribution.
   - Otherwise, Defect (D) to maximize immediate gains before the game ends.

3. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Calculate the proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round (p).
   - Determine thresholds:
     - Threshold1 = 75% of capacity
     - Threshold2 = 25% of capacity

   - If current stock (S) > Threshold1:
     - Cooperate, as a high stock can sustain some defection.
   - Else if Threshold2 < S ≤ Threshold1:
     - If p > 60%, Cooperate to encourage continued cooperation.
     - Otherwise, Defect to avoid contributing to resource depletion.
   - Else (S ≤ Threshold2):
     - Defect, as the stock is too low to sustain further cooperation.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to start positively.
- **Last Round:** Cooperate if possible to maintain fairness; otherwise, defect for immediate gain.
- **Stock Collapse:** If the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 25% capacity), players switch to Defecting to salvage remaining resources.

### Pseudocode:
```python
def decision(current_stock, previous_round_actions):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = game_capacity()
    
    # First round: Cooperate
    if is_first_round():
        return 'C'
    
    # Last round: Decide based on current stock
    if is_last_round():
        threshold_last = 0.5 * capacity
        if current_stock > threshold_last:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # Calculate proportion of Cooperators in the previous round
    p = sum(1 for action in previous_round_actions if action == 'C') / n
    
    # Define thresholds
    threshold1 = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold2 = 0.25 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > threshold1:
        return 'C'
    elif threshold2 < current_stock <= threshold1:
        if p > 0.6:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:  # current_stock <= threshold2
        return 'D'
```

### Summary:
This strategy promotes cooperation when the stock is healthy and there's a history of mutual cooperation, adapting to switch to defection when necessary to prevent resource collapse. It balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors in a repeated game setting.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to be adaptive, starting with cooperation and adjusting based on observed behavior and resource levels. Here's the organized approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with Cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Adaptation Based on Behavior**:
   - Calculate total consumption from previous rounds to estimate others' actions.
   - If most players are Cooperating, continue to Cooperate.
   - If significant Defection is detected, switch to Defecting.
3. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last few rounds (e.g., last 2), increase tendency to Defect to maximize individual payoffs without concern for future impacts.
4. **Stock Level Consideration**:
   - Cooperate if stock levels are above a threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity).
   - Consider switching to Defect if stock is low to either prevent further depletion or exploit others' cooperation.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the average consumption per player from past rounds.
   - If the average is close to the Cooperate level, continue Cooperating.
   - If the average suggests significant Defection (e.g., above a threshold), switch to Defecting.
3. **Last Few Rounds**: Increase tendency to Defect to maximize payoffs.
4. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - Cooperate if stock is above 80% of capacity.
   - Consider Defecting if stock drops below this threshold.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(history, current_round):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = game_capacity()
    r = total_rounds()

    # First round: Cooperate
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Calculate average consumption in previous rounds
    prev_consumption = sum([sum(round_actions) for round_actions in history])
    avg_cons_per_player = prev_consumption / (n * (current_round - 1))

    # Determine cooperation level from others
    cooperate_threshold = capacity / (2 * n)
    defect_threshold = capacity / n

    if avg_cons_per_player < (cooperate_threshold + defect_threshold) / 2:
        current_action = 'C'
    else:
        current_action = 'D'

    # Adjust for stock levels
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity and current_action == 'D':
        current_action = 'C'
    elif current_stock < 0.6 * capacity and current_action == 'C':
        current_action = 'D'

    # Endgame adjustment: Last few rounds
    if (r - current_round) <= 2:
        return 'D'

    return current_action
```

### Summary:
This strategy begins with cooperation to foster a positive environment, adapts based on observed consumption patterns, and adjusts in the endgame to maximize payoffs. By considering stock levels, it ensures sustainability while responding to potential defection, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_410 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game balances cooperation with defection based on historical behavior and resource levels, aiming to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining sustainability. Here's a structured outline:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating to encourage others to do the same and maintain a stable resource level.
2. **Monitor Behavior and Stock**: Track the proportion of Defectors in previous rounds (D_rate) and current stock levels.
3. **Adaptive Switching**:
   - If D_rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%) over recent rounds, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.
   - If stock is critically low (below a set level), Defect to maximize immediate gains.
4. **Recovery and Forgiveness**: After Defecting, if the stock recovers sufficiently, revert to Cooperating to sustain future benefits.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a positive trend.
   - **Last Round**: Defect to maximize payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, round_number):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    threshold_defectors = 0.3  # 30% defect rate triggers switch
    critical_stock_level = capacity * 0.7  # Example critical level
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate the proportion of Defectors in previous rounds
    recent_rounds = history[-window_size:] if len(history) > window_size else history
    d_rate = sum(1 for hist in recent_rounds if hist['D_count'] / n > threshold_defectors)
    average_d_rate = d_rate / len(recent_rounds) if recent_rounds else 0
    
    # Check current stock level
    if current_stock < critical_stock_level:
        return 'D'
    
    # Determine action based on Defection rate
    if average_d_rate > threshold_defectors:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
    
    # Handle last round separately
    if round_number == r:
        return 'D'
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust thresholds for D_rate and stock levels based on observed game dynamics.
- **Hysteresis**: Prevent frequent switching by requiring significant changes before altering strategy.
- **Memory Mechanism**: Use a moving average of past behavior to avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuations.

This strategy aims to foster cooperation when beneficial while defending against exploitation, ensuring adaptability across diverse opponent behaviors and game conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_411 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate in the first 2-3 rounds to encourage a sustainable resource level and set a positive example for other players.

2. **Monitoring Parameters**:
   - **Stock Level**: Track the current stock relative to capacity. Use two thresholds: low (40% of capacity) and high (60% of capacity).
   - **Cooperation Rate**: Calculate the average cooperation rate over the last 3-5 rounds to assess collective behavior.

3. **Decision Rules**:
   - **High Cooperation Scenario**: If the stock is above 60% of capacity and the cooperation rate exceeds 70%, continue Cooperating to maintain a healthy resource.
   - **Low Cooperation or Stock Crisis**: If the stock drops below 40% or the cooperation rate falls below 50%, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.
   - **Intermediate Cases**: Adjust based on others' behavior. If the cooperation rate is above 60%, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to promote a positive start.
   - **Last Round (if known)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.

5. **Collective Mindset**: Aim for mutual cooperation to sustain the resource, adapting to collective behavior and stock health to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

**Pseudocode Outline**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock, capacity, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate recent cooperation rate (last 3 rounds)
        recent_history = history[-3:]
        cooperation_rate = sum(1 for action in recent_history.values() 
                              for a in action.values() if a == 'C') / (n * len(recent_history))
        
        stock_threshold_low = 0.4 * capacity
        stock_threshold_high = 0.6 * capacity
        
        # Decision logic
        if stock > stock_threshold_high and cooperation_rate > 0.7:
            return 'C'
        elif stock < stock_threshold_low or cooperation_rate < 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Intermediate case: Cooperate if others are mostly Cooperating
            if cooperation_rate > 0.6:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

This strategy balances between maintaining the resource when feasible and defecting to prevent collapse, adapting dynamically based on stock levels and collective behavior.

To design a robust and adaptive collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to consider both immediate payoffs and long-term sustainability.

### **1. Decision Rules**

#### **Initial Rounds**
- **Action**: Cooperate (C)
  - Rationale: Starting with Cooperation builds a foundation for future collaboration and helps maintain or increase the stock level, which is crucial in the early rounds.

#### **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2)**
- **Cooperate** if:
  1. Current stock `S` is above a dynamic threshold (`T`).
  2. In the previous round, more than half of the players Cooperated.
- **Defect** otherwise.

#### **Last Few Rounds (Last 2 or 3 rounds)**
- **Defect** if:
  - The current stock `S` divided by `n` is greater than `S/(2n)` (i.e., defecting yields a higher immediate payoff).
- **Cooperate** otherwise to maintain any remaining stock.

---

### **2. Dynamic Threshold Calculation**

The threshold `T` is dynamically adjusted based on the stock's historical trends and recent behavior:

```
threshold = max(
    0.5 * capacity,
    min(capacity, 0.9 * (average_stock_over_last_3_rounds))
)
```

- This ensures that cooperation continues when the stock is healthy but allows for adaptation if the stock starts to deplete.

---

### **3. Adaptation Mechanisms**

#### **Stock Trend Analysis**
- Track the average stock level over the last 5 rounds.
- If the trend shows a significant decrease (e.g., by more than 10%), increase defection likelihood to exploit remaining resources before they're gone.

#### **Opponent Behavior Monitoring**
- Calculate the percentage of Cooperators in recent rounds.
- If cooperation is prevalent, continue Cooperating to sustain higher stock levels.
- If defection increases, adapt by defecting more frequently to prevent excessive resource depletion.

---

### **4. Edge Cases Handling**

#### **First Round (Round 1)**
- Always Cooperate to encourage others and build a sustainable resource base.

#### **Last Round (Round r)**
- Defect if the current stock allows for a higher immediate payoff (`S/n > S/(2n)`).
- Otherwise, Cooperate to maintain any remaining resources.

---

### **5. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, capacity, historical_stock, prev_actions):
    n = number_of_players
    r = total_rounds
    
    # Initial Round: Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate dynamic threshold
    recent_avg = average(historical_stock[-5:]) if len(historical_stock) >= 5 else capacity / 2
    threshold = max(0.5 * capacity, min(capacity, 0.9 * recent_avg))
    
    # Determine opponent cooperation rate in previous round
    coop_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    majority_coop = (coop_count / n) > 0.5
    
    # Middle Rounds: Cooperate based on threshold and opponent behavior
    if round_number < r - 2:
        if current_stock >= threshold and majority_coop:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # Last Few Rounds: Balance between exploitation and sustainability
    else:
        # Immediate payoff comparison
        immediate_payoff_defect = current_stock / n
        immediate_payoff Cooperate = current_stock / (2 * n)
        
        if immediate_payoff_defect > immediate_payoff_cooperate:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

---

### **6. Strategy Summary**

- **Early Rounds**: Prioritize cooperation to build and maintain stock levels.
- **Middle Rounds**: Use a dynamic threshold and monitor opponent behavior to decide between Cooperate or Defect, encouraging sustainability when possible.
- **Late Rounds**: Shift towards defection if it yields higher immediate payoffs, balancing exploitation with any remaining resource potential.

This strategy adaptively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, aligning with a collective mindset while being robust against varying opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_413 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that encourages cooperation while adapting to potential exploitation. Here's the organized solution:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy aims to promote long-term sustainability by defaulting to cooperation but switching to defecting when the resource is overexploited. This balance ensures individual gains without depleting the common pool.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Default Cooperation:**
   - Players start with Cooperate (C) in the first round and subsequent rounds if the stock remains above a critical threshold, promoting sustainable use.
   
2. **Defect Threshold:**
   - If the current stock falls below 30% of capacity, players switch to Defect (D). This indicates potential overuse, prompting immediate gain maximization before resource collapse.

3. **Transition Buffer Zone:**
   - Between 30-40% stock, players may alternate or use probabilistic choices (e.g., 50% chance to Cooperate/Defect) to encourage others to cooperate without causing instability.

### Edge Cases Handling:
1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent and contribute to sustainable stock levels.

2. **Last Few Rounds (Last 3 Rounds):**
   - Switch to Defect if the stock is above 50% to maximize immediate gains without concern for future sustainability, as there are no subsequent rounds.

### Implementation:
The strategy uses a state-dependent approach, monitoring the current stock and transitioning between cooperation and defecting based on predefined thresholds. This adaptability ensures the strategy remains robust against various opponent behaviors while maintaining collective sustainability goals.

### Pseudocode:
```python
def decide_action(stock_level, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to set a positive precedent

    # Check if the stock is critically low
    capacity = get_capacity()  # Assume this function returns the maximum sustainable level
    critical_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    high_stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity

    if stock_level < critical_threshold:
        return 'D'  # Defect to maximize immediate gains when resource is critically low
    elif round_number > total_rounds - 3 and stock_level > high_stock_threshold:
        return 'D'  # Defect in the last few rounds if stock is still high

    # If the stock is between critical threshold and a higher buffer zone, consider alternating or probabilistic choices
    buffer_low = 0.3 * capacity
    buffer_high = 0.4 * capacity
    if buffer_low < stock_level < buffer_high:
        # Alternate or use a probability to encourage cooperation without causing instability
        # For example, flip a coin between C and D
        return random.choice(['C', 'D'])
    
    # Otherwise, cooperate
    return 'C'
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy effectively balances individual gain with collective sustainability by defaulting to cooperation but switching to defecting when the resource is overexploited. It handles edge cases like the first and last rounds appropriately, ensuring adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_414 = '''
To address the problem of sustainably managing a shared resource through cooperative behavior while adapting to potential exploitation and endgame scenarios, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold-Based Defection

1. **Initial Phase (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - *Rationale:* Starting with cooperation when the stock is at capacity ensures sustainability and maintains resource levels for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds (From round 2 to r - k):**
   a. **Check Current Stock:**
      - If current stock \( S \geq T \) (where \( T = 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \)), proceed.
      - *Rationale:* Cooperating when the stock is above half capacity helps sustain resource levels through balanced consumption and replenishment.

   b. **Assess Recent Defection Rates:**
      - Look back at the last \( l = 3 \) rounds.
      - Calculate the percentage of defects among other players' actions in these rounds.
      - If the defection rate is less than \( p = 20\% \), continue to cooperate.
      - *Rationale:* Low defection rates indicate others are also cooperating, maintaining trust and sustainability.

   c. **Decision Based on Assessments:**
      - If both conditions (high stock and low defection) are met, **cooperate**.
      - Otherwise, **defect**.
        - *Rationale:* Switching to defecting when either the resource is low or others are exploiting prevents being exploited further.

3. **Endgame Phase (Last \( k = 3 \) Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - *Rationale:* In the final rounds, defecting maximizes individual payoff since there's no future punishment for defection, and cooperation may not yield significant returns.

### Parameters:
- **\( T = 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \):** Threshold stock level above which cooperation is sustained.
- **\( l = 3 \):** Number of recent rounds to assess defection rates.
- **\( p = 20\%: \)** Defection rate threshold; if exceeded, switch to defecting.
- **\( k = 3 \):** Last three rounds where defection is optimal regardless of other factors.

### Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Cooperate as the stock is high and initial cooperation helps maintain sustainability.
- **Last Rounds (Endgame):** Defect to maximize immediate payoffs, acknowledging limited future consequences.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Continue cooperating to sustain resource levels.
- **Stock Near Zero:** Defect to exploit remaining resources before potential collapse.

### Conclusion:
This strategy balances sustaining cooperation for mutual benefit while protecting against exploitation, especially towards the end of the game. It dynamically adapts based on current stock levels and recent history of others' behavior, ensuring robustness across various scenarios without relying on coordination with other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_415 = '''
**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over all rounds by balancing immediate gains and long-term sustainability of the common pool.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

- **Cooperate (C):**
  - When the current stock is above a dynamically adjusted threshold.
  - Encourages sustainable use, promoting growth for future rounds.

- **Defect (D):**
  - When the current stock is below the threshold or when the observed defection rate is high.
  - Maximizes immediate payoff while protecting against resource depletion.

---

### **2. Threshold Adjustment**

- **Initial Threshold:** Set to 75% of capacity, ensuring a buffer for growth and sustainability.
  
- **Dynamic Adjustment:**
  - Track the proportion of defects in each round.
  - Lower the threshold if defection rates increase, encouraging more defection to prevent rapid depletion.
  - Keep or raise the threshold if cooperation is prevalent, promoting sustainable use.

---

### **3. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to test sustainability and encourage others to follow suit.
  
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of rounds):**
  - Increase likelihood of defecting due to reduced future payoff considerations.
  - However, continue to prioritize sustainability if possible to maintain resource levels.

---

### **4. Adaptation Mechanism**

- Use a moving average of defection rates from previous rounds to adjust the threshold smoothly.
- Incorporate a smoothing factor to prevent drastic changes in strategy and avoid oscillations between cooperation and defection.

---

### **5. Implementation Steps**

1. **Initialize Parameters:**
   - Set initial threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
   - Define minimum and maximum thresholds for stability.

2. **First Round Action:** Cooperate to encourage sustainable play.

3. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. Calculate the current stock.
   b. Determine if it's above or below the adjusted threshold.
   c. Choose action (C/D) based on the decision rules.
   d. Update defection rate tracker and adjust the threshold for next rounds.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment:** Gradually increase likelihood of defecting while considering remaining rounds to balance immediate gains and sustainability.

---

### **6. Example Scenarios**

- **All Cooperate:** Stock remains stable, promoting long-term growth.
- **High Defection Rate:** Threshold lowers, encouraging more defection to prevent resource crash.
- **Mixed Strategies:** Adjust based on observed behavior; cooperate if sustainable, defect if stock is threatened.

---

**Summary:** This strategy dynamically balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and historical opponent behaviors. By adjusting thresholds and adapting over time, it aims to maximize payoffs while preserving the common pool resource for sustained benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_416 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation**

The strategy balances individual gain with the sustainability of the common pool resource by dynamically adjusting between cooperation and defection based on the current state of the stock.

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above a dynamic threshold, which is initially set at 50% of capacity.
   - Defect otherwise.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - After each round, update the threshold based on whether the stock increased or decreased.
     - If the stock after growth exceeds the previous round's stock, increase the threshold slightly (e.g., +10%) to encourage more cooperation.
     - If the stock decreases below the previous round's level, decrease the threshold slightly (e.g., -10%) to allow more defection.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to contribute to a healthy initial stock.
   - **Last Round (if known):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

4. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy aims for sustainable resource use by Cooperating when resources are sufficient and adapting to prevent over-depletion.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def determine_action(stock, capacity, history):
    # Initialize threshold if first round
    if not history:
        threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    else:
        last_stock = history[-1]['stock_after']
        growth_impact = stock - last_stock
        if growth_impact > 0:
            threshold *= 1.1  # Increase threshold to encourage cooperation
        else:
            threshold *= 0.9  # Decrease threshold to allow more defection

    if stock >= threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy adaptively responds to the resource's state, promoting sustainability while allowing for adjustments based on past outcomes.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_417 = '''
The designed collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is structured to encourage sustainable cooperation while adapting to potential defection. The approach balances immediate payoffs with long-term resource management.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Round:** Cooperate in the first round to foster a cooperative environment and maintain the resource.
2. **Monitoring and History Tracking:** Keep track of each player's actions (Cooperate or Defect) from previous rounds, focusing on recent history for responsiveness.
3. **Cooperation Rate Calculation:** Compute the average cooperation rate among all players over the last few rounds (e.g., 3-5 rounds).
4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - If the cooperation rate is above a threshold (initially set at 70%), continue Cooperating to sustain the resource.
   - If below, switch to Defecting for a limited number of rounds to incentivize others to return to cooperation.
5. **Stock-Based Adaptation:** Monitor the current stock level. If the stock is significantly low or not recovering, increase the likelihood of defecting to maximize immediate payoffs.
6. **Endgame Adjustment:** As rounds near the end (last 10% of total rounds), lower the cooperation threshold to prioritize short-term gains over resource sustainability.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Default to Cooperate to encourage mutual benefit.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Focus on immediate payoffs, adjusting strategies dynamically as future payoffs diminish.
- **Stock Collapse:** If stock is critically low, defect to salvage remaining resources before potential collapse.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
# Initialize strategy parameters
initial_cooperate = True
history_window = 5  # Number of past rounds to consider
cooperation_threshold = 0.7  # Initial threshold for cooperation rate
endgame_adjustment_rounds = 0.1 * r  # Rounds near the end where adjustments happen

def decide_action(round_number, history, current_stock):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent cooperation rate
    recent_history = history[-history_window:]
    total_players = n
    cooperate_count = sum(action.count('C') for action in recent_history)
    cooperation_rate = cooperate_count / (total_players * len(recent_history))
    
    # Adjust threshold if near endgame
    if round_number > r - endgame_adjustment_rounds:
        adjusted_threshold = max(cooperation_threshold - 0.2, 0.3)
    else:
        adjusted_threshold = cooperation_threshold
    
    # Check current stock health
    if current_stock < (capacity * 0.3):  # If stock is critically low
        return 'D'
    
    if cooperation_rate > adjusted_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Summary:
This strategy starts with cooperation, tracks recent behavior to maintain sustainability, and adapts by defecting when necessary to prevent resource collapse. It balances immediate gains with long-term benefits, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors in the tournament setting.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

To address the complexities of the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy is designed to encourage cooperation while adapting to different player behaviors.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C) as there is no prior history, promoting a stable initial stock level for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Reciprocity (Tit-for-Tat)**: Observe the average cooperation rate of other players in the previous round.
     - If most players cooperated (above a 60% threshold), cooperate this round to sustain the stock.
     - If many defected, consider defecting (D) as retaliation to incentivize future cooperation.
   - **Stock Health**: Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If the stock is below 20% of capacity, prioritize cooperation (C) to allow regrowth and prevent further depletion.

3. **Last Few Rounds**:
   - Maintain cooperation to keep the stock stable for any remaining rounds, preventing sudden drops in payoff despite reduced future impact.

### Stock Monitoring Threshold:

- Use a threshold of 20% of the capacity. If the stock falls below this level, players should be more inclined to cooperate (C) to prevent further depletion and allow regrowth.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **All Players Defect**: The strategy would mirror defection, leading to continued defection. However, after experiencing low payoffs, some players might switch back to cooperation.
- **Mix of Cooperators and Defectors**: The strategy encourages more cooperation over time by rewarding it through reciprocity.

### Summary:

This adaptive Tit-for-Tat approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. By using reciprocity and monitoring stock health, the strategy adapts to different player behaviors while maintaining a collective benefit, fostering a feedback loop that encourages cooperation when beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_419 = '''
The proposed collective strategy involves each player making decisions based on both the current stock level and the recent cooperation rates of others. The goal is to maintain sustainable Cooperation by Cooperating when resources are abundant and past Cooperation has been high, while allowing for Defection when necessary to prevent resource depletion.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Round (t=1):**
   - Since the game starts with the stock at capacity, all players default to Cooperate.
   - This ensures maximum growth in the first round and sets a positive precedent for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t>1):**
   - Each player evaluates two factors:
     - **Current Stock Level (S_current):** Is S_current above 80% of capacity?
     - **Recent Cooperation Rate:** In the previous round, did at least 75% of players Cooperate?

3. **Decision Rule:**
   - If both conditions are met (S_current ≥ 80% and prev_coop_rate ≥ 75%), the player Cooperates.
   - Otherwise, the player Defects.

4. **Adjustments for Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, there's no prior cooperation data, so all players default to C.
   - In later rounds, if Cooperation drops below 75%, players may start defecting, potentially leading to higher total consumption and lower stock levels in subsequent rounds.

**Rationale:**

- **Maintaining High Stock Levels:** By Cooperating when resources are abundant (S ≥ 80%), players ensure sustainable growth and prevent rapid depletion.
- **Encouraging Sustained Cooperation:** The requirement for high recent cooperation rates (≥75%) reinforces mutual interest in maintaining a healthy resource base, discouraging unilateral Defection.
- **Adaptability:** The strategy adapts dynamically based on current conditions, allowing for adjustments if Cooperation falters or resources dwindle.

This approach aims to balance individual payoffs with collective sustainability, promoting a stable equilibrium where Cooperation is the norm unless threatened by insufficient resources or low cooperation rates.

description_COLLECTIVE_420 = '''
**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff over r rounds while balancing immediate gains and long-term resource sustainability.

**Structure:**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative baseline to encourage others and sustain the resource for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Parameters:**
     - Stock level relative to capacity.
     - Average cooperation rate of other players.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If stock is above 80% of capacity and average cooperation rate among others exceeds 70%, continue Cooperating.
     - If stock drops below 80% or average cooperation rate falls below 70%, switch to Defecting more frequently to maximize current gains.

3. **Later Rounds (Last 2-3):**
   - **Action:** Increase defection rate
   - **Rationale:** Focus on immediate gains as the game nears its end, taking advantage of what's left before it depletes.

**Adaptation and Adjustments:**

- **Threshold Monitoring:** Implement thresholds for stock level (e.g., 80%) and cooperation rate (e.g., 70%). Adjust actions based on crossings of these thresholds.
- **Randomness Element:** Introduce slight randomness in strategy to avoid synchronized defection with other players, which could lead to quicker resource depletion.
- **Sustainability Consideration:** While defecting more can boost short-term payoffs, maintain a balance to prevent precipitous drops in stock that harm long-term gains.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate due to lack of historical data.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Shift towards Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources before the game ends.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior, resource levels, and game progression, aiming to optimize both individual payoffs and collective sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_421 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative norm early on to encourage others and build a healthy stock level.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Decision Rules:**
     a. **Current Stock Threshold:** If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, cooperate.
     b. **Recovery Rate (R):** Calculate as the growth rate from the previous round's stock to the current stock. If R is positive and indicates healthy recovery, continue cooperating.
     c. **Defection History:** Track defection rates over recent rounds. If more than 50% of players defected in the last k rounds, consider defecting to signal dissatisfaction with cooperation levels.

3. **Later Rounds (Approaching the End):**
   - **Action:** Defect if approaching the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%) as there's less incentive to preserve the resource for non-existent future rounds.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff with no future rounds.
   - **Very Low Stock (below 25% of capacity):** Defect, as higher immediate payoffs are prioritized despite risks.

5. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Use a moving average of stock levels and defection rates to adjust cooperation thresholds adaptively.
   - If recovery is poor or defection rates are high, increase the threshold for cooperation to encourage others to preserve the resource.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
for each round in r rounds:
    if current_round == 1:
        choose C
    elif current_round == last_round:
        choose D
    else:
        S = current_stock
        R = calculate_recovery_rate()
        D_count = count_defectors_in_previous_k_rounds(k)
        
        threshold_S = capacity * 0.75
        
        if S > threshold_S and R > 0:
            choose C
        elif D_count / n > 0.5:
            choose D
        else:
            choose D based on stock recovery and defection history

function calculate_recovery_rate():
    return (current_stock - previous_stock) / capacity

def count_defectors_in_previous_k_rounds(k):
    count = sum of defectors in last k rounds
    return count
```

**Conclusion:**

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation based on current stock levels, recovery rates, and historical defection patterns. It is robust against various opponent behaviors and adapts to different game parameters, aiming to maximize collective payoffs while preserving the resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_422 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability in a dynamic environment, we propose a strategic approach that adapts based on current conditions. Here is the structured solution:

### Approach
The strategy involves:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to build or maintain the stock without risking early collapse.
2. **Dynamic Defection Threshold**: Use a threshold-based system where defection occurs if the current stock exceeds 75% of capacity and has been consistently high over recent rounds, indicating that others are also managing consumption sustainably.
3. **Adaptive Adjustment**: Dynamically adjust the defecting threshold based on recent trends; increase it when the stock is rising (indicating effective cooperation) and decrease it when the stock is falling to encourage more cooperation.

### Solution Code
```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []
        self.capacity = None
        self.threshold = 0.75  # Default threshold as a fraction of capacity

    def get_action(self, current_stock, num_players):
        if not self.capacity:
            self.capacity = current_stock  # Initial assumption; might need adjustment
        
        if len(self.history) == 0:  # First round
            action = 'cooperate'
        else:
            # Calculate average of past few rounds (e.g., last 3)
            recent_stocks = self.history[-3:] if len(self.history)>=3 else self.history
            avg_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks) if recent_stocks else current_stock
            
            # Check if current stock is above threshold and average is increasing
            if (current_stock > self.capacity * self.threshold and 
                all(s <= current_stock for s in recent_stocks)):
                action = 'defect'
            else:
                action = 'cooperate'
        
        self.history.append(current_stock)
        return action

# Example usage:
strategy = Strategy()
num_players = 4
current_stock = 100  # Initial state

for _ in range(5):
    action = strategy.get_action(current_stock, num_players)
    print(f"Current Stock: {current_stock}, Action: {action}")
    
    # Simulate consumption and growth (simplified)
    if action == 'cooperate':
        consumed = current_stock / (2 * num_players) * num_players
    else:
        consumed = current_stock / num_players * num_players
    
    remaining = max(current_stock - consumed, 0)
    growth = min(remaining * 2 * (1 - remaining / strategy.capacity), strategy.capacity - remaining)
    current_stock = remaining + growth
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to avoid early stock depletion.
- **Dynamic Threshold**: A threshold (75% of capacity) is used to determine when to defect. This threshold can be adjusted based on observed trends in stock levels over recent rounds.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: By monitoring the stock's performance, the strategy adapts: allowing more defection when the system is stable and encouraging cooperation when the stock is at risk.

This approach ensures that individual gains are maximized without compromising long-term sustainability, making it robust against varying player behaviors and environmental conditions.

2. **Dynamic Thresholding**: Adjust the willingness to defect based on the current stock relative to capacity and the number of remaining rounds.
3. **Feedback from History**: Use past stock levels and consumption patterns to inform decisions, ensuring adaptability.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a sustainable stock level.
- **Middle Rounds**: Calculate a threshold dynamically. If the current stock is above this threshold, defect; otherwise, cooperate.
- **Final Rounds**: Allow more defection as future rounds become less impactful.

### Threshold Calculation:
The threshold starts at 60% of capacity and increases as the game progresses towards the end. This adjustment allows players to maximize immediate gains without risking long-term depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate recent stock trend
    window = min(len(history), 5)
    recent_stocks = history[-window:]
    avg_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks) if recent_stocks else capacity
    
    # Base threshold starts at 60% of capacity and increases towards the end
    base_threshold = capacity * 0.6
    remaining_weight = (round_number / total_rounds)
    threshold_adjustment = capacity * 0.2 * remaining_weight
    dynamic_threshold = base_threshold + threshold_adjustment
    
    # Prevent over-adjustments; cap at 80% of capacity
    safe_upper_limit = capacity * 0.8
    adjusted_threshold = min(dynamic_threshold, safe_upper_limit)
    
    if stock > adjusted_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages sustainable use in early rounds.
- **Dynamic Thresholding**: Adjusts based on remaining rounds and observed trends, allowing controlled defection when safe.
- **Feedback from History**: Uses past data to refine decisions, ensuring adaptability to changing conditions.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, fostering mutual benefit by preserving the common pool resource.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation and Defection**

The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability by adapting to current conditions and historical data.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Early Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Cooperate unconditionally to foster a cooperative environment and sustain the resource for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Stock Above 80% of Capacity:** Continue Cooperating to maintain sustainable levels.
   - **Stock Below 30% of Capacity:** Switch to Cooperating to allow regrowth and prevent depletion.
   - **Stock Between 30-80%:**
     - Check recent cooperation rates (last few rounds):
       - If more than 60% of players have Cooperated, continue Cooperating to sustain the balance.
       - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate payoff and avoid being exploited by defectors.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3 rounds):**
   - Defect to maximize personal gains as there are no future rounds for retaliation or reward.

### Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Cooperate to maintain stability.
- **Critically Low Stock:** Cooperate to allow regrowth; defecting would risk permanent depletion.
- **Last Round:** Defect to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(stock, history):
    round_number = current_round
    total_rounds = r  # Total number of rounds

    early_phase = range(1, 4)  # First 2-3 rounds
    late_phase_start = max(total_rounds - 3, 1)  # Last 2-3 rounds

    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    coop_threshold = 0.6  # 60% cooperation rate

    if round_number in early_phase:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number >= late_phase_start:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if stock >= high_threshold:
            return 'C'
        elif stock <= low_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            recent_coop = proportion_of_cooperators(history, last_n_rounds=3)
            if recent_coop > coop_threshold:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Early Rounds:** Encourage cooperation to build a sustainable resource base.
- **Middle Phase:** Adjust actions based on stock levels and recent player behavior, promoting stability when possible and defecting to prevent exploitation.
- **Late Rounds:** Maximize immediate payoff by defecting as future rounds are no longer a concern.

This strategy is adaptive, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability while considering the collective dynamics of the game.

**Final Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to encourage others and set a positive precedent.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Assess two key factors:
     - **Historical Cooperation Rate:** Calculate the proportion of cooperative actions from all players up to the current point.
     - **Current Stock Level:** Evaluate whether the stock is above a defined threshold, indicating sufficient sustainability.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - If both the historical cooperation rate exceeds 60% and the current stock level is above half of capacity, continue to Cooperate (C).
   - Otherwise, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff or respond to perceived exploitation.

4. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Defect (D) regardless of other factors, as there is no future beyond this round to preserve the stock for.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock_level, historical_cooperation_rate):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        cooperate_threshold = 0.6  # 60% cooperation rate
        stock_threshold = capacity / 2  # Half of the maximum sustainable level
        
        if (historical_cooperation_rate > cooperate_threshold and 
            stock_level > stock_threshold):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

**Rationale:**
- **Cooperation in the First Round:** Encourages a cooperative environment from the start.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability based on observed cooperation and resource levels.
- **Final Round Defection:** Maximizes payoff without concern for future rounds, preventing unnecessary stock preservation.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, encouraging cooperation while defending against exploitation, ensuring a balance between individual gain and collective resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_426 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for harvesting resources while considering regrowth, we analyze the behavior of cooperating versus defecting under different conditions. The key insights are as follows:

1. **Cooperating Behavior**: When all players cooperate, the resource stock increases over time because the growth rate compensates for consumption. This sustainable approach ensures long-term availability.

2. **Defecting Impact**: Defectors consume more resources, risking over-depletion. However, without information on others' strategies, defecting might offer short-term gains but risks future scarcity.

3. **Sustainable Yield**: Cooperating leads to a stable or increasing stock, making it optimal for long-term resource management. The model shows that cooperation sustains the resource, unlike defecting which can deplete it.

**Conclusion**: Always cooperate to ensure sustainable harvesting and prevent over-depletion.

\boxed{\text{Always Cooperate}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_427 = '''
To address the problem of sustainable resource management among players, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy involves:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Players start by cooperating to establish a stable resource base.
2. **Dynamic Threshold-Based Defection**: Except for the first and last rounds, players defect if the current stock exceeds a threshold (set at 50% of capacity) and cooperate otherwise. This helps prevent over-depletion while allowing for some exploitation.
3. **Final Round Maximization**: In the last round, all players defect to maximize their final payoff since there's no future punishment.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
current_round = t
total_rounds = r
capacity = C

if current_round == 1:
    action = 'C'
elif current_round == total_rounds:
    action = 'D'
else:
    if stock > 0.5 * capacity:
        action = 'D'
    else:
        action = 'C'
return action
```

This strategy aims to sustain the resource while allowing players to maximize their payoffs without causing irreversible depletion.

**Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate in the first round, defect if the stock exceeds 50% capacity in subsequent rounds (except the last), and defect in the final round.}}

description_COLLECTIVE_428 = '''
**Strategy Description: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock and Opponent Behavior**

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining sustainable use of the common pool resource. It adapts dynamically based on the current stock level and recent opponent behavior.

1. **Initial Round**: Always Cooperate to establish a baseline for sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Check**: 
     - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate to help preserve and regrow the resource.
     - If the stock is above 75%, consider Defecting if many opponents have been Cooperating recently.
   - **Opponent Behavior**:
     - Track the number of opponents who Defected in previous rounds. If more than half of opponents have been defecting frequently, increase tendency to Cooperate this round.
   - **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Adjust thresholds based on remaining rounds. In later rounds (last 10%), be slightly more lenient with Defecting but still prioritize preserving the stock.

3. **Last Few Rounds**: Be cautious about over-depletion; prioritize Cooperating to ensure moderate payoffs rather than risking high consumption that could deplete the stock for future rounds.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(stock, round_number, total_rounds, opponent_defect_history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = initial_stock
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        stock_threshold_low = 0.5 * capacity
        stock_threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
        
        defect_rate = sum(opponent_defect_history) / len(opponent_defect_history)
        
        # If stock is low, Cooperate to preserve
        if stock <= stock_threshold_low:
            return 'C'
        # If many opponents are defecting, Cooperate more
        elif defect_rate > 0.5:
            return 'C'
        # In later rounds, balance between harvesting and sustainability
        elif round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
            if stock > capacity * 0.9:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        # If stock is high and opponents are Cooperating, Defect
        elif stock > stock_threshold_high:
            if defect_rate < 0.3:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        # Default: Cooperate to maintain balance
        else:
            return 'C'
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy starts by Cooperating in the first round to promote sustainability.
- It monitors the stock level and adjusts actions based on whether the stock is low (Cooperate) or high (consider Defecting).
- Opponent behavior is tracked; if many are defecting, it encourages more Cooperation to prevent further depletion.
- In later rounds, while still prioritizing Cooperation, there's a slight allowance for Defection when the stock is very high to balance immediate gains with sustainability.

This approach ensures adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors, aiming to maximize long-term payoff while maintaining resource levels.

description_COLLECTIVE_429 = '''
**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** To maximize collective payoffs while ensuring sustainable resource management over multiple rounds.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **Default Action:** Cooperate (C) in the first few rounds to build and maintain stock levels, promoting sustainability.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold Monitoring:**
     - **High Stock (Above 80% of Capacity):** Continue Cooperating (C) to sustain resource health.
     - **Moderate Stock (50%-80% of Capacity):** Maintain Cooperation (C) but remain vigilant. If many players Defect, consider switching strategies in subsequent rounds.
     - **Low Stock (Below 50% of Capacity):** Switch to Defecting (D) temporarily to reduce consumption pressure and allow the stock to recover.

3. **Later Rounds:**
   - As the game approaches the final few rounds (e.g., last 10%), consider adjusting strategies knowing there's no future impact beyond these rounds:
     - **Final Round(s):** Players might defect to maximize individual payoffs, understanding it won't affect subsequent rounds.

### Adaptive Feedback Loop:

- Each player independently assesses stock levels and recent consumption patterns. Adjustments are made based on the observed depletion rate and others' actions, encouraging a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.

### Edge Cases Handling:

1. **First Round:**
   - Default to Cooperate (C) to set a foundation for sustainable resource management.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Consider defecting (D) to maximize individual payoffs, recognizing the lack of future rounds to manage stock depletion.

3. **Stock Depletion:**
   - If stock drops significantly due to Defectors, switch to D temporarily to prevent further collapse and allow recovery in subsequent rounds.

### Summary:

- The strategy begins with Cooperation to sustain resources.
- It adapts based on dynamic thresholds (high, moderate, low stock levels) to balance individual gains against collective sustainability.
- As the game nears its end, players may shift towards Defecting to maximize final payoffs, understanding the trade-offs involved.

This approach encourages a balanced strategy that is adaptive and robust, aligning with the collective goal of maximizing total payoffs while managing resource depletion sustainably.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_430 = '''
The proposed strategy is designed to maximize payoffs by balancing cooperation for sustainable resource levels and defecting when necessary. It adapts based on the current stock level, round number, and recent player behavior.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Early Rounds (First 25% of total rounds):** Always Cooperate to build up the common pool and encourage others to do the same.
   
2. **Mid Game:** Monitor the proportion of cooperation among other players over the past few rounds. If a significant majority are cooperating, continue to cooperate; otherwise, defect.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 25% of total rounds):** Shift towards Defecting, especially if the stock is low or others have been defecting recently. However, maintain cooperation if the stock remains high and others are still cooperating.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to start sustainably.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Increase defection tendency as future rounds' potential for punishment diminishes.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(stock_level, n, r, current_round, history):
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity  # Adjust based on game parameters if possible
    k = 3  # Number of recent rounds to consider
    p_threshold = 0.6  # Proportion of cooperation needed

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Check if it's late game (last quarter)
        if current_round > (3/4) * r:
            if stock_level < threshold:
                return 'D'
            else:
                recent_actions = history[-k:] if len(history) >= k else history
                coop_count = sum(1 for a in recent_actions if a == 'C')
                if (coop_count / len(recent_actions)) > p_threshold:
                    return 'C'
                else:
                    return 'D'
        else:
            # Mid game: check stock and recent cooperation
            if stock_level > threshold:
                recent_actions = history[-k:] if len(history) >= k else history
                coop_count = sum(1 for a in recent_actions if a == 'C')
                if (coop_count / len(recent_actions)) > p_threshold:
                    return 'C'
                else:
                    return 'D'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Early Rounds:** By always Cooperating, the strategy aims to maintain high stock levels, encouraging others to follow suit and sustain the resource.

- **Mid Game Adaptation:** The strategy monitors recent player actions. If a majority are Cooperating, it continues to do so; otherwise, it defects to prevent being exploited when others are not maintaining sustainability.

- **Late Rounds Adjustment:** As rounds approach the end, the focus shifts more towards defecting if the stock is low or if others have been defecting, as there's less incentive for future cooperation. However, it still Cooperates if the stock remains high and others maintain sustainable practices.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to different player behaviors while remaining robust without relying on specific coordination mechanisms.

**Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation and Defection Based on Sustainability**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage others to do the same, promoting a sustainable resource level.

2. **Monitor Stock Dynamics**: After each round, assess the stock level. Use this information to determine if cooperation is effective or if defection is becoming prevalent.

3. **Threshold for Switching**:
   - If the stock drops below 50% of capacity after several rounds, switch to defecting to maximize individual payoff before resource depletion.
   - Continue cooperating if the stock remains stable or recovers, maintaining sustainability.

4. **Adaptation Based on Player Behavior**: Track the number of players defecting. If over 50% of players are defecting, consider switching to defection to avoid being exploited and to maximize immediate gains.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
   - **Last Few Rounds**: Consider potential increases in defection as rounds conclude. Adjust strategy accordingly based on observed behavior and stock levels.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability, adapting dynamically to the game's evolving state and other players' actions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_432 = '''
To address the problem of devising a strategy for an AI agent in a repeated game where players can either Cooperate or Defect, we need to consider the dynamics of resource sustainability and immediate payoff maximization. The goal is to create a robust strategy that adapts based on the current state of the shared resource (stock) relative to its capacity.

### Approach
The proposed strategy balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains by monitoring the stock level and adjusting actions accordingly. Key components include:

1. **First Round**: Start by Cooperating to encourage resource preservation.
2. **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.
3. **Intermediate Rounds**:
   - **High Threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity)**: Cooperate when the stock is above this level, as it indicates a sustainable state allowing for growth.
   - **Low Threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity)**: Defect when below this level to maximize immediate gain before further depletion.
   - **Between Thresholds**: Adjust based on whether the stock is increasing or decreasing. If the stock is increasing, Cooperate; if decreasing, Defect.

This approach incorporates hysteresis to prevent oscillations between actions due to minor fluctuations in stock levels.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    high_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        if current_stock > high_threshold:
            return "Cooperate"
        elif current_stock < low_threshold:
            return "Defect"
        else:
            # Assume we have access to previous stock levels; in reality, this would require tracking
            # For the sake of example, let's assume a trend is determined from historical data
            # This part requires additional state tracking which isn't shown here
            if determine_trend(current_stock):
                return "Cooperate"
            else:
                return "Defect"

def determine_trend(current_stock):
    # Simplified trend determination (in practice, this would track changes over time)
    # For example, compare current_stock with previous rounds' stocks
    # This is a placeholder for actual trend calculation logic
    return True  # Assuming an upward trend for demonstration

# Example usage:
total_rounds = 10
capacity = 100
stock_history = [100, 95, 87, 80, 72, 65, 60, 58, 63, 70]

for current_round in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    action = determine_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock_history[current_round - 1], capacity)
    print(f"Round {current_round}: Action is {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **First Round**: The strategy starts by Cooperating to promote a sustainable resource base.
- **Last Round**: Knowing there are no future rounds, the agent defects to maximize immediate payoff.
- **Intermediate Rounds**:
  - When the stock is above 80% of capacity, cooperation ensures continued sustainability.
  - Below 60%, defecting maximizes short-term gain as the resource is already being heavily used.
  - Between these thresholds, the strategy checks the trend of the stock. An increasing trend suggests others are Cooperating, encouraging continuation; a decreasing trend indicates potential Defection by others, prompting a switch to Defect.

This approach provides a balance between long-term sustainability and short-term gain optimization, adapting dynamically based on observed resource levels.

**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Strategy**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale**: Starting with cooperation encourages others to do the same, helping sustain the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision Rules**:
   - **Step 1: Assess Cooperation Level**:
     - Observe the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
     - Calculate the percentage of cooperators relative to total players (n).
   
   - **Step 2: Evaluate Stock Level**:
     - Check if the current stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity).

   - **Decision Making**:
     - If more than 50% of players cooperated and the stock is above 60%, choose to Cooperate (C).
     - Otherwise, choose to Defect (D).

3. **Stock Threshold Mechanism**:
   - If the current stock drops below 40% of capacity:
     - Temporarily switch strategy to always Cooperate (C) until the stock recovers above 60%.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment**:
   - In the last 10% of rounds, increase cooperation efforts to prevent a rush on resource exploitation.
     - Adjust the cooperation threshold to be more lenient, encouraging continued cooperation despite fewer future rounds.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Default to Cooperate (C).
   - **Low Stock Recovery**: Once stock exceeds 60%, revert to normal decision rules after a recovery phase of 3 rounds.
   - **Sudden Defection Surge**: If cooperation drops below 30% in a round, consider immediate defecting as a reactive measure.

**Pseudocode Representation**:

```python

            if history is empty:
                return 'C'
            else:
                last_round = history[-1]
                cooperators = sum(1 for action in last_round if action == 'C')
                coop_percentage = cooperators / n

                stock_threshold_low = 0.4 * capacity

                # Modified conditions for final rounds
                if (coop_percentage > 0.4 and current_stock >= stock_threshold_high) or (current_stock < stock_threshold_high):
                    return 'C'

                    return 'D'
        return decide_action
    else:
        return decide_action
```

**Explanation**:
- The strategy begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable resource base.
- It adapts based on the previous round's actions and the current stock level, encouraging mutual cooperation when beneficial.
- A critical threshold ensures that if resources are severely depleted, all players switch to cooperating to aid recovery.
- Final rounds adjustments prevent a last-minute rush to exploit the resource, promoting continued cooperation for mutual benefit.

To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable harvest in a multi-player game where players can either Cooperate or Defect, we propose a strategy called "Sustainable Harvest." This strategy balances individual payoff maximization with the collective need to preserve the resource. The approach involves dynamic decision-making based on current stock levels and recent cooperation trends among players.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to help build or maintain the resource level.
2. **Observation**: In each subsequent round, observe the current stock level (S) and the proportion of players who Cooperated in the previous round (C_prev).
3. **Decision Rules**:
   - If the current stock is above 60% of capacity and at least 70% of players Cooperated last round, continue Cooperating.
   - If the current stock drops below 40% of capacity or less than 30% of players Cooperated last round, switch to Defecting.
   - For intermediate cases, use a weighted decision where cooperation is more likely if recent cooperation has been above average and the stock is not too low.

### Solution Code
```python
def sustainable_harvest_strategy(current_stock, capacity, previous_cooperation):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if current_stock == None:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    T = 0.5 * capacity  # Target stock level for optimal growth
    S = current_stock
    C_prev = previous_cooperation
    
    # Decision thresholds
    high_c_threshold = 0.7
    low_c_threshold = 0.3
    high_s_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    low_s_threshold = 0.4 * capacity
    
    if S > high_s_threshold and C_prev >= high_c_threshold:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif S < low_s_threshold or C_prev <= low_c_threshold:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        # Weighted decision: favor Cooperate if cooperation was moderately high
        # and stock is not too low, else lean towards Defect
        if (C_prev > 0.5 * high_c_threshold) and (S >= 0.8 * T):
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Defect"

# Example usage:
current_stock = 400  # Example value, adjust as needed
capacity = 500       # Example capacity
previous_cooperation = 0.6  # Proportion of players who Cooperated last round

decision = sustainable_harvest_strategy(current_stock, capacity, previous_cooperation)
print(f"Decision: {decision}")
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The strategy starts with Cooperation to encourage a positive trend in resource levels.
- **Observation and Decision Making**: Each round, players assess the current stock level relative to an optimal target (50% of capacity) and the cooperation rate from the previous round. This dual assessment helps determine whether to Cooperate or Defect.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: The strategy adapts dynamically by adjusting its behavior based on current conditions. If the resource is healthy and most players are cooperating, it continues Cooperating. Conversely, if resources are low or cooperation is sparse, it switches to Defecting to maximize individual gains while preventing resource collapse.

This approach aims to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging collective action through responsive and adaptive decision-making.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_435 = '''
The strategy is designed to maintain cooperation when the resource stock is healthy, switch to defection if others start defecting too much, and handle edge cases like initial rounds and nearing game end.

**Final Answer:**

The collective strategy balances cooperation with defection based on current stock levels and past player actions. Here's a clear outline:

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish sustainability.
   - **Subsequent Rounds (excluding last few):**
     - If stock > 80% of capacity: Cooperate.
     - If stock < 60% of capacity: Defect.
     - Between 60% and 80%:
       - If over half defected last round: Defect.
       - Else: Cooperate.
   - **Last Few Rounds (10% or so):** Defect to maximize payoffs.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - Always cooperate in the first round.
   - Near game end, defect to capitalize on remaining rounds.

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   - Cooperate when resources are plentiful to sustain them.
   - Adapt to defection by defecting if necessary but aim to rebuild cooperation.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, previous_actions):
    # Initial round always cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate thresholds
    c_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    d_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    
    # Check stock against thresholds
    if current_stock > c_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < d_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Between thresholds, check previous round's defection rate
        num_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions[-1] if action == 'D')
        if num_defectors / len(previous_actions[-1]) > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    # Handle last few rounds (e.g., last 10%)
    if round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        return 'D'
```

This strategy adapts dynamically, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and switching to defection when necessary, ensuring robust performance across various game conditions.

**Final Answer: Adaptive Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to maximize collective payoff by balancing immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability. It adapts dynamically based on current stock levels and historical player behavior.

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** When the stock level is above 80% of capacity (`S_high = 0.8 * capacity`), indicating a healthy resource base.
   - **Defect (D):** If the stock is below `S_high` and more than 30% of players have defected in past rounds, suggesting a need for caution.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to foster initial sustainability.
   - **Last Round:** Adjust based on stock level; Cooperate if high, else consider Defecting only if others are likely to do so.

3. **Adaptive Mechanisms:**
   - Use a moving average of past defection rates to avoid overreacting to short-term changes.
   - Dynamically adjust `S_high` based on stock recovery trends to prevent oscillations.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Monitor current stock and historical actions in each round.
   - Apply thresholds to decide between C and D, considering both stock level and past behavior.
   - Adjust strategy dynamically to respond to changing conditions without overreacting.

This approach ensures robust performance against diverse opponent strategies, promoting sustainability while adapting to real-time changes.

**Final Answer: Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Threshold Collaboration (ATC)

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while preserving the common pool resource through adaptive cooperation and defection based on dynamic thresholds.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

- **Dynamic Thresholds:**
  - Set two thresholds, `Low` and `High`, based on current stock (`S`), where:
    - `Low = capacity / (2n)` (minimum safe level to avoid collapse)
    - `High = capacity / n` (maximum safe level for defection without causing significant depletion)

- **Action Decision:**
  - If `S >= High`: Defect (D) as the resource is abundant, and defection is safe.
  - If `Low < S < High`: Use a majority vote among players to decide action. If more than half of recent actions were cooperation, Cooperate; else, Defect.
  - If `S <= Low`: Cooperate (C) to prevent stock collapse.

- **Adaptive Adjustment:**
  - After each round, adjust thresholds based on observed stock growth and consumption patterns:
    - Increase `High` if stock consistently regrows despite defection.
    - Decrease `Low` if stock fails to recover after cooperation.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:**
  - Start with Defect (D) as the initial stock is at capacity, and defecting is safe without prior history.

- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of rounds):**
  - Force Cooperation (C) to ensure sustainable resource levels for any remaining rounds, preventing a sudden crash.

---

### **3. Collective Mindset Alignment**

The strategy aligns with the collective mindset by:

- Promoting long-term sustainability through adaptive cooperation when necessary.
- Encouraging defection only when safe and beneficial, thus avoiding unnecessary resource depletion.
- Using historical data and majority behavior to foster implicit coordination without explicit communication.

---

### **4. Implementation Notes**

- Track historical stock levels and player actions to dynamically adjust thresholds.
- Use a simple majority vote mechanism based on recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds) to decide cooperation or defection when in the intermediate threshold range.
- Regularly update thresholds after each round to respond to changing resource conditions.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def ATC_strategy(S, history):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = game_capacity

    # Calculate dynamic thresholds
    Low = capacity / (2 * n)
    High = capacity / n

    if S >= High:
        return 'D'
    elif S <= Low:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Use majority vote from history to decide action
        recent_actions = history[-5:]  # Last 5 rounds' actions
        cooperation_count = sum(1 for a in recent_actions if a == 'C')
        
        if cooperation_count > len(recent_actions) / 2:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

    # Adaptive adjustment of thresholds based on stock dynamics (to be implemented post-round)
```

---

**Conclusion:** The ATC strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on the resource's state and historical behavior. This adaptive approach aims to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining collective resource health, making it robust against diverse opponent strategies in the tournament.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_438 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining sustainable resource levels while balancing immediate payoffs, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both current stock conditions and past actions of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to preserve the initial high stock level.
2. **Monitor Consumption and Stock Levels**:
   - After each round, calculate total consumption (TC_prev) based on all players' actions.
   - Track changes in stock levels (Delta_S = S_current - S_prev).
3. **Detect Significant Defection**: Determine if others have been defecting by comparing TC_prev to the expected cooperation level (S_prev / 2). If TC_prev exceeds this by a significant margin, it indicates more defection.
4. **Adjust Based on Stock and Defection**:
   - Cooperate if current stock is above an ideal threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) and there's no significant defection.
   - Defect if the stock drops significantly or others are defecting, to signal the consequences of defection and maximize immediate payoffs.

### Detailed Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
   - Cooperate in the first round to maintain a high initial stock level.
2. **Each Subsequent Round**:
   a. **Calculate Total Consumption (TC_prev)**:
      - For each player, if they Cooperated, add S_prev / (2n) to TC_prev; if Defected, add S_prev / n.
   b. **Determine Stock Change**: Compute Delta_S = S_current - S_prev.
   c. **Check for Significant Defection**:
      - Compare TC_prev with the expected cooperation level (S_prev / 2).
      - If TC_prev > S_prev / 2 + buffer, significant defection is detected.
   d. **Decision Logic**:
      - **Cooperate**: If current stock > 80% of capacity and no significant defection.
      - **Defect**: Otherwise, especially if Delta_S < 0 or significant defection is detected.

### Conclusion
This strategy aims to maintain high stock levels by defaulting to cooperation while adaptively defecting when necessary. By monitoring both stock trends and others' actions, it balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Moves):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to build a sustainable resource base and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock and Player Actions:**
     - Track stock levels after each round.
     - Observe how many players are defecting versus cooperating.
   - **Decision Rules Based on Stock Level:**
     - If the stock remains above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) despite others defecting, consider defecting to gain immediate payoffs without causing resource collapse.
     - If the stock is below this threshold, increase cooperation to preserve the resource for future rounds.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 2-3 Moves):**
   - **Adjust Based on Current Stock:**
     - If the stock is high, consider defecting more to gain larger immediate payoffs since there are fewer future rounds.
     - If the stock is low, cooperate to allow some recovery and prevent resource collapse.

4. **Adaptation and Learning:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level and other players' actions each round.
   - Adjust strategy dynamically based on the latest data to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round Default Action:** Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
   - **Stock Collapse Scenario:** If the stock is very low, prioritize cooperation to allow recovery and sustain future rounds.

6. **Collective Good Considerations:**
   - Ensure the strategy promotes mutual sustainability without exploiting others.
   - Be robust against varying player behaviors, encouraging collective preservation of resources.

This strategy balances short-term exploitation with long-term conservation, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and past interactions to maximize collective payoffs over multiple rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_440 = '''
The optimal strategy for balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in the context of repeated interactions without coordination is as follows:

**Cooperative Harvesting Strategy:**

1. **Threshold-Based Cooperation:**
   - **Defect** when the current stock (S) is above 80% of capacity and there's been a history of cooperation in recent rounds.
   - **Cooperate** when S drops below 80% or if there has been significant defection recently, to allow the resource to recover.

2. **Adaptation to Historical Behavior:**
   - Monitor past actions and payoffs to assess whether other players have been defecting excessively.
   - Shift towards cooperation if recent rounds show a pattern of low stock due to widespread defection.

3. **Risk Management:**
   - Avoid simultaneous defection at high S levels by considering the likelihood of others' actions based on historical data.
   - Use a dynamic threshold that adjusts according to past trends in resource depletion and recovery.

This strategy aims to prevent collapse by encouraging cooperation when necessary, while still allowing for defection to maximize gains under safe conditions. It balances immediate benefits with the need to sustain resources for future rounds, adapting dynamically to changing circumstances.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_441 = '''
The optimal strategy for maximizing individual payoff while considering the common resource's sustainability can be outlined as follows:

1. **Cooperation Phase**: When the stock level is above 75% of its maximum capacity (C), each player should cooperate by consuming an amount equal to C/(2n) per round. This ensures sustainable use of the resource, allowing it to replenish adequately between rounds.

2. **Defection Phase**: If the stock level drops below 75% of C, players should switch to defecting by consuming as much as possible (i.e., S/n per player). This phase aims to maximize immediate gain when the resource is critically low, potentially leading to a collapse if not addressed.

**Rationale**:
- **Cooperation**: By limiting consumption to C/(2n), each player contributes to maintaining the stock's health. The total consumption remains at 50% of capacity (C/2), ensuring that the resource can regenerate sufficiently.
  
- **Defection**: When the stock is low, defecting allows individuals to secure as much of the remaining resource as possible before it potentially depletes entirely.

This strategy balances between long-term sustainability and short-term gains, though it carries a risk of abrupt collapse if the stock drops below the threshold. It serves as a heuristic approach that simplifies decision-making under uncertainty regarding others' strategies.

**Final Answer**: The optimal strategy is to cooperate when the stock is above 75% of its maximum capacity and defect otherwise. This can be succinctly expressed as:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S \geq 0.75C, \text{ else Defect}}$

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment**

The strategy aims to maintain a sustainable common pool resource by balancing immediate gains with long-term benefits. It employs adaptive behavior based on stock levels and historical actions, incorporating mechanisms to punish defection and encourage cooperation.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to promote a stable resource level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Cooperation Level Adjustment:** Monitor the stock and the proportion of Cooperators in previous rounds. If the stock is healthy (>75% of capacity) and most players Cooperated, continue Cooperating.
   - **Switch to Defecting:** If the stock drops below 60% of capacity or more than 40% of players Defected in the last round, switch to Defecting to signal dissatisfaction and encourage others to Cooperate.
3. **Forgiveness Mechanism:** After Defecting, revert to Cooperating if the stock stabilizes above 70% and cooperation levels improve over three consecutive rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Round (Round r):** If historical cooperation is high (>60%), Cooperate; otherwise, Defect to maximize individual payoff without future consequences.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def strategy(current_stock, history):
    n = number_of_players
    round_number = len(history) + 1

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation levels and stock trends
    recent_coops = sum(1 for action in history[-3:] if action == 'C') / (n * 3)
    stock_trend = current_stock - history['stock'][-1] if len(history['stock']) > 0 else 0

    # Decision criteria
    if recent_coops > 0.6 and current_stock >= capacity * 0.7:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < capacity * 0.6 or (1 - recent_coops) > 0.4:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Revert to Cooperate if stock improves
        if stock_trend > 0 and any(action == 'C' for action in history[-3:]):
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Handle last round differently
if round_number == r:
    if recent_coops > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Strategy Explanation:

- **Adaptive Cooperation:** The strategy adapts based on the current stock level and the cooperation observed in previous rounds. It promotes sustainability by Cooperating when conditions are favorable.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** By switching to Defecting when the resource is threatened or when many players defect, it signals the need for cooperation and discourages future defection.
- **Forgiveness:** After punishing Defectors, if cooperation resumes and the stock recovers, the strategy reverts to Cooperating to sustain the resource.

This approach ensures a balance between individual payoffs and collective sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors in repeated interactions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_443 = '''
To address the challenge effectively, we propose a strategy that encourages cooperation when both the resource (stock) is healthy and past cooperation levels are sufficient. This approach aims to sustain the resource while preventing exploitation by those who might defect.

**Strategy:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating in the first round to establish a foundation for maintaining the resource.
2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision Making:**
   - **Cooperation Conditions:** In each subsequent round, Cooperate if both:
     - The current stock is above 50% of its capacity.
     - More than half of the players Cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Defection Otherwise:** If either condition is not met, Defect to avoid exploitation and prevent further resource depletion.

**Rationale:**

- **Resource Health:** By requiring the stock to be above 50% of its capacity, we ensure that cooperation contributes to maintaining a sustainable level of resources.
- **Past Cooperation:** Checking that more than half of players Cooperated in the previous round ensures that cooperation is mutual and not one-sided, thus preventing exploitation.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider a game with `n=4` players and a stock capacity of 100. If all players follow this strategy:

- **Round 1:** All Cooperate. Each gets a payoff of 25 (from 100/(2*4) = 12.5, but assuming total consumption is 50).
- **Stock Management:** The stock remains healthy, allowing continued cooperation in subsequent rounds.

If one player defects:

- **Round t:** Three Cooperate, one Defects. Total consumption is 3*(100/8)=37.5 + 25=62.5.
- **Stock Recovery:** The remaining stock after consumption allows for growth, leading to a healthy stock in the next round if cooperation continues.

**Conclusion:**

This strategy balances maintaining the resource with preventing exploitation by ensuring mutual cooperation and healthy resource levels. It promotes sustainable play while adapting to changes in player behavior.

**Answer:**

To implement this strategy, players will Cooperate in the first round and continue Cooperating in subsequent rounds only if both conditions are met:

1. The current stock is above 50% of its capacity.
2. More than half of the players Cooperated in the previous round.

Otherwise, they will Defect.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; subsequently Cooperate only if the stock is above 50% and more than half Cooperated last round, else Defect}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_444 = '''
To design a robust strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we balance cooperation for sustainability with defection when necessary. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating to build trust and sustain the common pool.
2. **Monitor Behavior and Stock Levels:** Track the number of defects and stock levels over rounds.
3. **Adaptive Defection:** If defects are high (e.g., >50%) and the stock significantly decreases, switch to defecting temporarily.
4. **Sustainability Check:** Continue cooperating if the stock remains stable or recovers despite some defects.
5. **Final Round Adjustment:** In the last round, prioritize immediate payoff by defecting unless cooperation maintains a decent return.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
   - **Rationale:** Encourage others to cooperate and maintain the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step A: Assess Previous Round's Defects**
     - Calculate the proportion of defects from the previous round.
   - **Step B: Evaluate Stock Dynamics**
     - Check if the stock after consumption decreased significantly compared to earlier rounds.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If (proportion of defects > 50%) and (stock decrease is significant):
       - **Action:** Defect
       - **Rationale:** High defects indicate others are exploiting the resource; defecting maximizes immediate gain.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
       - **Rationale:** Maintain resource sustainability if cooperation levels are sufficient.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Step A: Evaluate Payoff Potential**
     - Calculate potential payoff from both actions given the current stock.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If defecting yields a higher immediate payoff without causing significant future impact:
       - **Action:** Defect
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
       - **Rationale:** Ensure a stable payoff if cooperation is viable.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Stock Near Capacity:** Continue cooperating to sustain growth.
- **Low Stock Levels (<20% capacity):** Switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains, as recovery is unlikely.
- **Persistent Defects:** Temporarily defect until cooperation restores resource levels or defects reduce.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```pseudocode
Initialize: cooperate = True

for each round in 1 to r:
    if round == 1:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        prev_defects = number of Defectors in previous round
        stock_decrease = (previous_stock - current_stock) / capacity > threshold
        
        if prev_defects / n > 0.5 and stock_decrease:
            action = Defect
            cooperate = False
        else:
            if not cooperate:
                # Check if cooperation has improved in last few rounds
                recent_coop_trend = (sum of Cooperate actions in last k rounds) >= threshold
                if recent_coop_trend:
                    action = Cooperate
                    cooperate = True
                else:
                    action = Defect
            else:
                action = Cooperate
    
    # Execute action and observe stock update

# Final Round Adjustment
if round == r:
    payoff_C = current_stock / (2*n)
    payoff_D = current_stock / n
    if payoff_D > payoff_C * 0.9:  # If Defecting yields at least 90% of Cooperate's payoff
        action = Defect
    else:
        action = Cooperate
```

### Summary:
This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on current conditions, ensuring resource sustainability while maximizing immediate gains when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_445 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

The problem involves determining an optimal strategy in a resource management game where players (including yourself) can either Cooperate or Defect. The goal is to maximize your total payoff over multiple rounds while considering the actions of other players.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Resource Dynamics**: Each player's action affects the stock level, which determines payoffs. Cooperating preserves resources and allows growth, while Defecting maximizes immediate gain but risks long-term depletion.
2. **Other Players' Strategies**: Without knowing others' strategies, assumptions must be made about their behavior (e.g., whether they will Cooperate or Defect).
3. **Payoff Calculation**: Payoff depends on the amount taken and the remaining stock's growth.

### Strategy Development:
The strategy balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability. The proposed approach is conditional cooperation based on the stock level relative to a threshold.

#### Steps:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to encourage resource preservation and growth.
2. **Threshold-Based Decision-Making**:
   - Set a high threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity) above which continuing to Cooperate is sustainable.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources before potential collapse.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initial Round**: Choose to Cooperate to help maintain or increase the resource level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **If Stock Level (S) ≥ 90% of Capacity (C)**: Continue Cooperating, as this indicates sufficient preservation and growth potential.
   - **If S < 90% of C**: Switch to Defecting, as the lower stock suggests insufficient cooperation, leading to a likely collapse; defecting maximizes short-term gain.

### Rationale:
- **Sustainability at High Levels**: When the stock is high (above 90%), Cooperating ensures resources are preserved and can grow, benefiting all players in the long run.
- **Response to Low Stock**: If the stock drops significantly, it signals that not enough players are Cooperating. Defecting becomes advantageous as it allows you to take a larger share before the resource is depleted.

### Testing the Strategy:
Simulations show that while this strategy can sustain cooperation when most players Cooperate, the presence of even a few Defectors can cause the stock to drop below the threshold, leading all players to Defect and collapse the system. However, it's a robust approach under conditions where cooperation is prevalent or recoverable.

### Conclusion:
The optimal strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by Cooperating when resources are abundant and defecting when they become scarce. This approach aims to maximize individual payoff while attempting to sustain the resource for mutual benefit.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the current stock is at least 90% of capacity; otherwise, Defect}}

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate (C)**: If the current stock level \( S \) is below a dynamically adjusted threshold \( T \).
   - **Defect (D)**: If \( S \geq T \).

2. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**:
   - Calculate \( T \) as an average of the past \( k \) rounds' stock levels, where \( k \) can be a fixed number or adjusted based on game progression.
   - Adjust \( T \) upwards if the stock has been growing steadily over recent rounds; lower \( T \) if the stock is declining.

3. **Initial and Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to build a stable stock base.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds)**: Apply stricter cooperation thresholds to preserve the resource, ensuring that any remaining rounds can still benefit from a healthy stock.

      - \( T \): Threshold initialized based on initial stock.
      - HistoricalStocks: List to track past stock levels.

   b. **Each Round**:
      1. Observe current stock \( S \).
      2. Calculate the threshold \( T \) as the average of the past \( k \) stock levels.
      3. If \( S < T \):
         - Play C.
      4. Else:
         - Play D.
      5. Record \( S \) for future threshold adjustments.

   c. **Adaptation**:
      - After each round, update HistoricalStocks and adjust \( T \) based on trends (e.g., increase \( T \) if stock is rising, decrease if falling).

This strategy ensures adaptive behavior, promoting cooperation when the resource is vulnerable and allowing defection when sustainable. It's robust to various opponent behaviors by focusing on observable state variables rather than others' strategies.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
Initialize:
    threshold = initial_stock  # Start with initial stock as threshold
    historical_stocks = [initial_stock]
    k = min(10, r)  # Number of past rounds to consider for threshold

for each round in 1 to r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    # Calculate dynamic threshold T
    if len(historical_stocks) >= k:
        T = average of last k entries in historical_stocks
    else:
        T = average of all available stocks
    
    # Determine action based on T and current stock
    if current_stock < T:
        play C
    else:
        play D
    
    # Update historical data for next round's threshold calculation
    historical_stocks.append(current_stock)
    
    # Adapt threshold based on trend (simplified example)
    if len(historical_stocks) > 1 and historical_stocks[-1] > historical_stocks[-2]:
        T *= 0.95  # Lower threshold if stock is increasing
    else:
        T *= 1.05  # Increase threshold if stock is stable or decreasing
    
    # Ensure T remains within reasonable bounds (e.g., between capacity/4 and capacity)
    T = max(capacity / 4, min(T, capacity))
    
end for
```

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring the common pool resource remains healthy throughout the game.

description_COLLECTIVE_447 = '''
To address the challenge of managing a common pool resource sustainably while maximizing individual payoffs in a multi-player, simultaneous-move game, we propose the **Adaptive Cooperation with Averaging** strategy. This strategy dynamically adjusts cooperation based on current resource levels and historical behavior trends, fostering sustainable use when beneficial.

### Strategy Outline

1. **Objective**: Maintain sustainable resource use while maximizing individual payoffs through rounds by balancing cooperation and defection based on observed conditions.

2. **Decision Rules**:
   - In each round, decide to Cooperate or Defect using the following criteria:
     a. Calculate the current stock level as a percentage of capacity: \( S_{\text{pct}} = \frac{\text{Current Stock}}{\text{Capacity}} \).
     b. Compute the average cooperation rate over the past k rounds (e.g., k=3 or 5): 
        \[
        \text{avg\_C\_prev} = \frac{\sum \text{Number of Cooperators in last } k \text{ rounds}}{k \times n}
        \]
     c. Apply thresholds:
        - If \( S_{\text{pct}} > 70\% \) AND \( \text{avg\_C\_prev} > 50\% \), Cooperate.
          - Encourages sharing when the resource is healthy and others are cooperating.
        - Else if \( S_{\text{pct}} < 60\% \) OR \( \text{avg\_C\_prev} < 40\% \), Defect.
          - Signals self-preservation due to low resources or widespread defection.
        - Otherwise, default to Cooperate.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Start by Cooperating since there's no history.
   - **Insufficient History (e.g., first k rounds)**: Use available data and default to Cooperate until enough history is built.

### Rationale

- The strategy promotes cooperation when it benefits the group, ensuring sustainable resource use. When resources are low or defection is prevalent, it allows for self-preservation by defecting.
- Using an average of past cooperation rates smooths out decision-making, preventing volatility from short-term behavior swings and fostering stability.

### Conclusion

This approach balances immediate needs with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and allowing defection as needed. It dynamically adapts to current conditions, making it robust for managing common pool resources in a multi-player setting.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_448 = '''
The optimal strategy for maximizing payoffs while considering the sustainability of the resource involves balancing cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and current resource levels. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same, helping maintain a high stock level.

2. **Adaptive Behavior in Subsequent Rounds**:
   - For rounds 2 through r-1 (all except the last), assess the previous round's cooperation rate.
   - If more than half of the players cooperated and the current stock is above 60% of capacity, continue to cooperate. This maintains resource sustainability when cooperation is widespread.
   - If the cooperation rate drops below this threshold or the stock falls below a critical level (20%), switch to defecting to prevent further resource depletion.

3. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, defect regardless of past behavior since there's no future punishment for defection.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate initially and continue doing so if more than half of players cooperated previously and the stock remains above 60% capacity. Otherwise, defect, especially in the last round. This approach balances cooperation sustainability with necessary defection when cooperation falters or resources are low.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; continue cooperating only if over half cooperate and stock is above 60%; otherwise, defect. Defect in the final round.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_449 = '''
**Final Answer: Adaptive Cooperative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The proposed strategy is designed to maximize collective payoff while adapting to opponents' behaviors and game dynamics.

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation helps maintain a high stock level, promoting growth for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Calculate Cooperation Rate:** Determine the proportion of times opponents have chosen C in previous rounds.
   - **Determine Thresholds:**
     - **Cooperation Threshold (CT):** Set at 60% initially, adjusted dynamically based on remaining rounds.
     - **Stock Threshold (ST):** Based on current stock relative to capacity and remaining rounds.
   - **Decision Logic:**
     - If the stock is above ST and opponents' cooperation rate exceeds CT:
       - Choose Cooperate (C)
     - Else:
       - Choose Defect (D)

3. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - As rounds progress, lower CT to encourage more defection towards the end.
   - ST decreases as rounds near conclusion, emphasizing immediate payoffs.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to preserve stock.
   - **Last Round:** Evaluate based on current stock and cooperation rate; may defect if others are likely to do so.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def strategy(history_opponents, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    opponents_coop = sum([action == 'C' for opp in history_opponents for action in opp])
    total_actions = sum([len(opp) for opp in history_opponents])
    coop_rate = opponents_coop / total_actions if total_actions > 0 else 1.0
    
    # Calculate thresholds
    remaining_rounds = total_rounds - round_number + 1
    stock_capacity_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    ct_threshold = max(0.4, 0.6 * (remaining_rounds / total_rounds))
    
    if current_stock > (capacity * 0.5) and coop_rate > ct_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to opponents' actions while considering the evolving game state.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_450 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate payoff with sustainable use of a shared resource, I propose a dynamic strategy that adjusts cooperation or defection based on the current state of the resource. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Step 1: Initialize Parameters
- **Threshold (T):** Start with an initial threshold set to 80% of capacity (e.g., T = 0.8 * capacity).
- **Adjustment Rate (α):** Choose a small rate, such as α = 0.1, to control how quickly the threshold adapts.

### Step 2: Decision Making in Each Round
For each round except the last:
1. **Observe Current Stock (S):** Check the current level of the resource.
2. **Decision Rule:**
   - If S > T: Defect (take a larger share for higher immediate payoff).
   - Else: Cooperate (preserve the resource to ensure future availability).

### Step 3: Adjust Threshold After Each Round
1. **Observe New Stock (S_new):** After your action, note the new stock level.
2. **Calculate Adjustment:**
   - Compute the change in stock: Δ = S_new - S_prev.
   - Update threshold: T += α * Δ.
   - Ensure T stays within reasonable bounds, e.g., min(T) = 0.5 * capacity and max(T) = 0.95 * capacity.

### Step 4: Handle Last Round
In the final round:
- Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.

### Example Application
Consider a scenario with n=4, capacity=100:

1. **Initial T = 80.**
2. **Round 1:** S=100 > T=80 → Defect. After consumption, stock drops to 25 (due to others' actions).
3. **Adjust T:** Δ = 25 - 100 = -75. T += α*(-75) → T decreases by 7.5 → New T=72.5.
4. **Round 2:** S=25 < T=72.5 → Cooperate. Stock recovers to 62.5.
5. **Adjust T:** Δ = 62.5 - 25 = +37.5. T += α*(+37.5) → T increases by 3.75 → New T=76.25.

This dynamic approach adapts to the resource's health, encouraging cooperation when stock is low and defection when it's abundant, while ensuring sustainable use over time.

### Final Answer
The optimal strategy dynamically balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adjusting your behavior based on the current state of the shared resource:

- **Cooperate** when the resource level is below a certain threshold.
- **Defect** when above this threshold.
- **Adaptively adjust** the threshold based on whether the resource is increasing or decreasing.

This approach maximizes cumulative payoff while preserving the resource for future rounds. The strategy can be succinctly described as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock is below a dynamically adjusted threshold; otherwise, defect.}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_451 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we developed a strategy that balances cooperation with adaptation based on others' behavior and stock levels. Here's a structured breakdown of the solution:

### Approach
The strategy involves three main components:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to encourage sustainability and build trust among players.
2. **Monitor and Adapt**: Track the proportion of Defectors over recent rounds and adjust actions accordingly. If too many players Defect, switch to Defecting; otherwise, continue Cooperating if the stock remains sufficient.
3. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Use a threshold based on the current stock level to decide between Cooperate or Defect, adjusting slightly towards the end of the game.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, remaining_rounds, current_stock, capacity, last_three_defectors):
    n = 4  # Assuming there are four players including yourself
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    
    # Calculate average proportion of defectors in the last three rounds
    avg_proportion_defectors = (sum(last_three_defectors) / (n * 3))
    
    if avg_proportion_defectors > 0.3:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock >= threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by Cooperating in the initial rounds to establish a cooperative environment and maintain the stock level.
2. **Proportion of Defectors**: By monitoring the average proportion of Defectors over the last three rounds, the strategy adapts to changes in others' behavior. If more than 30% of players Defect, it signals instability, prompting a switch to Defecting.
3. **Stock Threshold Check**: The strategy checks if the current stock is above a threshold (70% of capacity). If so, it continues Cooperating; otherwise, it defects to prevent over-depletion and maximize immediate payoff.

This approach ensures adaptability while maintaining cooperation when beneficial, balancing between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_452 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability, we propose a strategic decision-making framework for each player in the repeated game. The strategy is designed to adapt dynamically based on observed trends in resource levels.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation encourages others to do the same, fostering a sustainable resource level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 through r-1):**
   - **Observation:** Assess whether the stock increased or decreased from the previous round.
     - If the stock increased (i.e., growth exceeded total consumption), continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock decreased, switch to Defecting (D) in the next round.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** In the last round, there are no future consequences, so defecting maximizes immediate payoff.

### Edge Cases:

- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 10% of capacity), players may switch to defecting regardless of trend, as cooperation yields negligible benefits.
  
### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decision_round(current_round, total_rounds, previous_stock_change):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round < total_rounds:
        if previous_stock_change > 0:  # Stock increased
            return 'C'
        else:  # Stock decreased or stayed the same
            return 'D'
    else:  # Last round
        return 'D'
```

### Summary:

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting actions based on observed trends. Players cooperate when resources are sustainably increasing and defect when cooperation leads to depletion, ensuring optimal outcomes across all rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_453 = '''
To address the problem, we've developed an adaptive strategy that considers both the current state of the resource and the historical behavior of other players. This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, aiming to maximize individual payoff while maintaining the resource for future rounds.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first few rounds to encourage others to do the same.
2. **Stock Level Thresholds**: Use dynamic thresholds based on current stock levels to decide actions:
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 80% of capacity.
   - Defect if the stock drops below 50% of capacity.
3. **Recent Behavior Analysis**: In intermediate stock levels (between 50% and 80%), assess recent cooperation trends among other players:
   - If most players have been cooperating, continue to cooperate.
   - If a significant number defect, switch to defecting.
4. **Final Rounds Adjustment**: Switch to defecting in the last few rounds since there's no future impact.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, other_actions_history):
    capacity = get_capacity()  # Function that returns maximum sustainable stock
    
    if round_number <= 2:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number > total_rounds - 2:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Calculate recent cooperation rate
            recent_coop = sum(1 for actions in other_actions_history[-3:] for a in actions if a == 'C')
            total_actions = len(other_actions_history[-3:]) * (number_of_players - 1)  # Exclude self
            if total_actions == 0:
                return 'C'
            if recent_coop / total_actions > 0.6:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Rounds**: The strategy starts with cooperation to foster a collaborative environment.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: By setting thresholds based on stock levels, the strategy adapts to the current state of the resource.
- **Behavior Analysis**: Examining recent actions helps predict future behavior and decide whether to cooperate or defect based on others' tendencies.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment**: Recognizing that the last few rounds have no future impact, the strategy switches to maximizing immediate payoff.

This approach ensures a balance between individual gain and long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on both current conditions and past behaviors.

The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize collective payoff while encouraging sustainable use of the common pool resource. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Strategy Overview
- **Adaptive Cooperation Threshold**: Players dynamically adjust their cooperation based on historical cooperation levels from other players, with thresholds increasing over time or in response to stock depletion.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: Specific rules for the first and last rounds ensure initial encouragement of cooperation and cautious defecting towards the end.

### Decision Rules
1. **Cooperate if Historical Cooperation Meets Threshold**:
   - Each player tracks the number of Cooperate actions (C) from others in previous rounds.
   - They cooperate in the current round if this count meets or exceeds their dynamic threshold.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**:
   - The threshold increases as the game progresses, ensuring a stronger emphasis on cooperation over time.
   - Adjustments can also be based on stock levels; rapid depletion triggers higher thresholds to encourage preservation.

### Edge Cases Handling
- **First Round**: Default to Cooperate (C) to set a positive precedent and encourage others to follow suit.
- **Last Few Rounds**: Tendency to Defect (D) increases as future impacts are lessened, but balanced with the need to maintain resource sustainability.

### Feedback Mechanism
- Incorporates feedback on stock changes; rapid depletion triggers higher thresholds to promote cooperation and prevent over-exploitation.

### Pseudocode Implementation
```python
def decide_action(player_id, history_cooperations, current_round, total_rounds, stock_level):
    # Initial threshold setup based on game parameters and progression
    base_threshold = 0.5  # Base proportion of cooperators needed to cooperate
    time_factor = (current_round / total_rounds) ** 2  # Increasing factor over rounds
    depletion_factor = max(1 - (stock_level / capacity), 0.5)  # Response to stock depletion

    threshold = base_threshold + time_factor * depletion_factor

    # Calculate proportion of historical cooperations
    if current_round == 1:
        cooperation_prop = 1.0  # First round default to cooperate
    else:
        total_actions = (current_round - 1) * (n - 1)
        cooperation_prop = sum(history_cooperations) / total_actions

    # Decision based on threshold comparison
    if cooperation_prop >= threshold or current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage within the game loop
for each round in r:
    for each player in n:
        action = decide_action(player_id, history_cooperations, round, r, stock_level)
        record_action(action)
    update_stock()
```

### Conclusion
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively responding to others' behaviors and the state of the resource. It encourages cooperation when beneficial and adjusts thresholds dynamically to maintain resource levels effectively.

**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Historical Behavior and Stock Levels**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to foster a positive environment and encourage resource preservation.

   - **Defection Response:** If less than or equal to 40% of players Cooperated, Defect (D) to signal against excessive defection and protect immediate payoffs.

3. **Stock Level Adjustment:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to the capacity:
     - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, Cooperate to encourage growth.
     - If the stock is below or equal to 25%, Defect to maximize immediate payoff as future sustainability may be compromised.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - After each round, adjust the cooperation threshold based on the observed impact on stock levels and payoffs:
     - Increase the cooperation threshold if stock recovery is robust.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, a strategic approach is designed to balance immediate payoffs with long-term resource sustainability. Here's an organized strategy based on the thought process:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperation-Defection

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate
     - Aims to set a positive precedent, encouraging others to preserve the resource and allowing it to replenish.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Observation:**
     - Track other players' actions (C or D) and their cumulative contributions to stock depletion.
   - **Proportion of Defectors:**
     - If a significant majority (e.g., >50%) are defecting, switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoff before potential collapse.
     - Otherwise, continue cooperating to preserve the resource.
   - **Stock Level Monitoring:**
     - Maintain an optimal target stock level (e.g., around half of capacity).
     - Cooperate if above target; consider defecting if below to capitalize on remaining resources.

3. **Endgame Handling (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect
     - Focus on maximizing immediate payoffs since there's no future benefit in preserving the resource.

4. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Continuously adjust thresholds for cooperation/defection based on observed behavior and stock dynamics.
   - Use feedback from past rounds to refine strategies, ensuring adaptability without causing instability.

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to foster a sustainable environment.
- **Adaptive Behavior:** Monitors others' actions and stock levels to decide between cooperation or defection, balancing immediate gains against future sustainability.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Shifts focus to maximizing payoffs in the final rounds when preservation no longer benefits future interactions.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while promoting collective resource management, adapting dynamically to changing conditions without relying on explicit coordination.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_457 = '''
To address the problem of sustaining a shared resource through cooperation or defection, we propose an adaptive strategy based on monitoring the current stock level relative to its capacity. The key idea is to cooperate when the stock is sufficiently high and defect when it falls below a critical threshold, encouraging conservation.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define Threshold:** Establish a threshold, set at two-thirds (2/3) of the resource's maximum capacity. This threshold serves as a trigger point for switching strategies.

2. **Monitor Stock Level:** Continuously track the current stock level relative to the defined threshold.

3. **Decision-Making:**
   - If the current stock is above the threshold (i.e., greater than 2/3 of capacity), players should cooperate by contributing to resource maintenance.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, players switch to defecting, reducing their consumption or contributions to allow the resource to recover.

4. **Adaptation:** Optionally, adjust the threshold dynamically based on historical trends (e.g., increasing cooperation if the stock shows signs of recovery and vice versa).

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy combines cooperation when the resource is abundant with defection when it's scarce to prevent overuse. Players should:

1. Cooperate when the current stock exceeds two-thirds of its capacity.
2. Defect otherwise.

This approach balances resource use, encouraging sustainability by maintaining the resource when it's healthy and conserving it when threatened.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the current stock is above } \frac{2}{3} \text{ of capacity; otherwise defect.}}

To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable resource level while balancing individual benefits, we propose a strategy that adapts based on the current state of the resource. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Cooperation-Defection Based on Stock Threshold

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the initial rounds to build or maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Monitor Current Stock (S)**:
   - After each round, observe the new stock level and compare it against a predetermined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).

3. **Adjust Strategy Based on Threshold**:
   - **Cooperate**: If the current stock \( S \) is above or equal to the threshold.
     - Reasoning: A healthy stock allows for sustainable growth when Cooperating, maximizing long-term benefits.
   - **Defect**: If the current stock \( S \) falls below the threshold.
     - Reasoning: Defecting reduces immediate consumption, allowing the stock to recover and preventing further depletion.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (Optional)**:
   - To optimize responsiveness, consider adjusting the threshold dynamically based on recent trends or performance.
   - Use a moving average of past stock levels to determine thresholds, giving more weight to recent data for timely adjustments.

### Example Scenarios:

- **All Cooperate**: The stock remains stable at 100%, ensuring maximum sustainable growth and payoffs.
  
- **Mixed Strategies**:
  - If some players Defect while others Cooperate, the stock may decrease initially. However, as players monitor the stock drop below the threshold, they switch to Defecting, reducing consumption and allowing the stock to recover over subsequent rounds.

- **Majority Defection**: If most players Defect persistently, the stock might continue to decline. This scenario highlights the importance of maintaining cooperation levels above a critical mass to sustain the resource effectively.

### Considerations:

- **Threshold Selection**: The threshold should be chosen carefully to balance between preventing overconsumption and avoiding unnecessary defection. It may need adjustment based on specific game dynamics or observed behavior patterns.
  
- **Adaptation Lag**: Since players base their decisions on previous rounds' stock levels, there might be a delay in response to rapid changes. Incorporating recent trends can help mitigate this lag.

### Conclusion:

This strategy encourages cooperation when the resource is healthy and switches to defection as a corrective measure when overconsumption threatens sustainability. By dynamically adapting based on the resource's state, it balances individual interests with collective well-being, fostering an equilibrium where cooperation prevails when beneficial and defection serves as a safeguard against depletion.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if current stock is above 75% of capacity; otherwise, Defect.}}

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize long-term payoffs by balancing cooperation and defection based on game dynamics and opponent behaviors. Here's the organized approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with Cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage others to do the same, fostering a cooperative environment.

2. **Monitoring Behavior**: Observe other players' actions over time. Track the number of Cooperators and Defectors. Use recent behavior (weighted more heavily) to assess current strategies.

3. **Stock Level Thresholds**: 
   - If the stock remains above 50% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
   - If it drops below this threshold, consider switching to Defecting to punish Defectors and encourage future cooperation.

4. **Adaptive Retaliation**: 
   - Retaliate by defecting if a significant number of players are defecting.
   - After retaliation, if the stock recovers, revert to Cooperating to reset the cooperative environment.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to set a positive tone.
   - **Last Few Rounds**: Adjust based on current stock. If high, Cooperate; if low, consider Defecting cautiously to avoid excessive depletion.

6. **Sustainability vs Immediate Gain**: Balance between short-term gains from defecting and the long-term benefits of cooperation, ensuring sustainable stock levels for future rounds.

This strategy aims to encourage mutual cooperation while being responsive to defectors, aiming to maximize total payoff over all rounds by promoting a cooperative equilibrium.

description_COLLECTIVE_460 = '''
To address the challenge of sustainably managing a shared resource through cooperative behavior, I propose a strategic approach that each player can adopt independently. This strategy is designed to maintain the health of the resource while allowing for adaptation based on observed actions of others.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating in the first round. This sets a positive precedent and aligns with the goal of sustainability.

2. **Threshold-Based Decision Making:** Establish a threshold, specifically half of the resource's capacity (e.g., 50 units if capacity is 100). If the current stock level exceeds this threshold, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

3. **Sustainability Mechanism:** When the stock remains above the threshold, Cooperating ensures that consumption does not exceed regenerative capacity. This maintains a stable resource level over time, as seen in scenarios where all players Cooperate, leading to consistent replenishment.

4. **Adaptation to Defection:** If the stock drops below the threshold due to increased Defection by others, switch to Defecting. This action serves two purposes: it prevents further depletion by reducing individual contribution to consumption and incentivizes others to reconsider their strategies to avoid a resource collapse.

5. **Recovery Process:** Even if some players Defect temporarily, as long as the majority Cooperates above the threshold, the resource can recover. The regenerative growth ensures that the stock level oscillates upwards over time, reinforcing the effectiveness of the strategy.

**Answer:**

Each player should adopt a simple yet effective strategy:

1. **Start by Cooperating:** In the first round, choose to Cooperate to promote sustainable use and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Set a Threshold at Half Capacity:** If the current stock level is greater than half of the total capacity (e.g., 50 units if capacity is 100), continue to Cooperate. This threshold ensures that resource consumption remains within regenerative limits, maintaining stability.

3. **Adapt Based on Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below this threshold due to increased Defection by others, switch to Defecting. This action prevents further depletion and signals to others the need for cooperative behavior to sustain the resource.

4. **Encourage Recovery:** By Cooperating when above the threshold and defecting only when necessary, the system can recover from temporary declines. The regenerative nature of the resource ensures that as long as most players adhere to this strategy, sustainability is maintained over time.

**Final Answer:**

Each player should begin by Cooperating. If the current stock level exceeds half of capacity (e.g., 50 units for a total of 100), continue to Cooperate; otherwise, Defect. This strategy ensures sustainable resource management and adapts to changes in others' behaviors.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the stock is above half capacity; otherwise, defect}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_461 = '''
**Final Strategy Description: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

The strategy is designed to promote sustainable resource use while adapting to the behavior of other players. It balances cooperation for long-term benefits against defecting to maximize immediate gains, especially as the game progresses.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 20%):**
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 60% of capacity.
   - Defect if the stock is below this threshold to salvage what can be taken.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - Calculate the average stock level over the past 10 rounds (or a fixed number, whichever is smaller).
   - Cooperate if the average stock is above 60% of capacity.
   - Defect otherwise to maximize immediate gain.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Last 20%):**
   - Always defect to maximize personal payoff without concern for future depletion.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **First Round:** Cooperate if stock > 60% of capacity; else, defect.
- **Last Round:** Always defect.
- **Stock Near Capacity (>80%):** Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
- **Stock Near Depletion (<30%):** Defect to maximize gains before resource exhaustion.

---

### **Implementation Notes**

- Use thresholds (e.g., 60%, 30%) based on empirical testing or theoretical analysis.
- Consider recent stock trends over the past few rounds to adapt to changing player behaviors.
- Vary last-round behavior slightly or introduce randomness to prevent exploitation by others.

This strategy aims for collective sustainability when possible while adapting to exploit opportunities for higher payoffs as needed.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_462 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining sustainable resource levels through cooperative actions while adapting to potential defections, we propose an adaptive strategy that considers both current resource levels and historical cooperation rates. The strategy incorporates thresholds for resource sustainability and hysteresis to prevent oscillations between cooperation and defection.

### Approach
The proposed approach involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to promote sustainable resource use.
2. **Threshold-Based Decisions**:
   - If the current stock is above a high threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), continue to cooperate as it indicates a healthy resource level.
   - If the current stock drops below a low threshold (e.g., 40%), defect to maximize personal payoff before the resource collapses.
3. **Historical Cooperation Check**: When the stock is between the high and low thresholds, check the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round:
   - Cooperate if the majority (e.g., ≥70%) cooperated previously.
   - Defect otherwise to avoid being exploited by defectors.
4. **Hysteresis Effect**: To prevent oscillations, require a higher cooperation rate and sustained stock levels above the high threshold before reverting from defection back to cooperation.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(prev_stock, prev_actions):
    """
    Determines whether to Cooperate ('C') or Defect ('D') based on current state and previous actions.
    
    Args:
        prev_stock (float): The stock level before the current round.
        prev_actions (list of str): Actions taken by all players in the previous round.
        
    Returns:
        str: 'C' for Cooperate, 'D' for Defect.
    """
    n = len(prev_actions)
    capacity = 100.0  # Assuming maximum stock is 100
    
    # Define thresholds
    high_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.4 * capacity
    coop_threshold = 0.7  # 70% cooperation needed to Cooperate when in the middle zone
    
    # Calculate previous cooperation proportion
    prev_coop_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'C')
    prev_coop_proportion = prev_coop_count / n if n != 0 else 1.0
    
    # Current stock is given as prev_stock, but depending on the game's state access,
    # it could be different; assuming that the function has access to current stock
    current_stock = prev_stock  # For this example, using previous stock as current
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < low_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if prev_coop_proportion >= coop_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage
prev_actions = ['C', 'C', 'D', 'D']  # Previous round actions: two Cooperate, two Defect
prev_stock = 62.5  # Current stock before the current round

action = decide_action(prev_stock, prev_actions)
print(f"Decision: {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts with cooperation to build a sustainable resource base.
- **Threshold-Based Decisions**: By using thresholds (high at 60% and low at 40%), the strategy ensures that cooperation continues when resources are abundant and switches to defection when resources are critically low.
- **Historical Cooperation Check**: When the stock is in a middle range, the strategy evaluates past behavior. If most players cooperated previously, it continues to cooperate; otherwise, it defects to avoid exploitation.
- **Hysteresis Effect**: This prevents frequent switching by requiring a higher bar for reverting back to cooperation once defection has started.

This approach balances individual payoff maximization with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on current conditions and historical interactions.

description_COLLECTIVE_463 = '''
**Final Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** To maximize individual payoff while maintaining sustainable use of the common pool resource over multiple rounds.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to encourage others to do the same, preserving the resource and promoting sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Cooperate if:**
     - The current stock is above 80% of capacity.
     - The stock has increased compared to the previous round, indicating effective cooperation.
   - **Defect if:**
     - The current stock is below 80% of capacity.
     - The stock has decreased despite others' potential cooperation, suggesting exploitation.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

**Adaptive Thresholds and Trends:**

- **Dynamic Stock Evaluation:** Adjust the decision threshold based on the current stock level relative to capacity and the trend of stock changes over recent rounds.
- **Trend Analysis:** If the stock is increasing, continue cooperating. If decreasing, consider defecting to prevent further depletion.

**Considerations for Opponent Behavior:**

- Assume others may defect or cooperate unpredictably. The strategy should adapt by mirroring collective behavior when possible and defecting if many are exploiting the resource.
- Recognize that cooperation benefits all in the long run, while defection risks depleting the resource and reducing future payoffs.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Track historical stock levels to assess trends (increasing or decreasing).
- Adjust the cooperation threshold dynamically based on observed behavior and stock recovery potential.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by cooperatively managing the resource when possible and defecting when necessary to prevent exploitation or collapse.

description_COLLECTIVE_464 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to balance immediate gains against long-term sustainability by adapting to others' actions and the current stock level.

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to foster a sustainable resource base without prior information on others' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - Observe the previous round's cooperation rate.
   - If more than half of the players cooperated and the current stock is above a moderate threshold, continue Cooperating.
   - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate payoff or prevent resource depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Defect to capture maximum immediate payoff since future rounds do not exist.

4. **Stock Thresholds:**
   - Use the capacity as a reference point. A moderate threshold could be 60% of capacity, encouraging cooperation when the stock is healthy.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_level, history, n, capacity):
    # Determine the action based on current state and history
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        prev_round = history[-1]
        num_coop = sum(1 for action in prev_round['actions'] if action == 'C')
        
        # Thresholds: majority cooperation and stock above moderate level
        coop_threshold = n / 2
        stock_threshold = capacity * 0.6  # Adjust as needed
        
        if num_coop >= coop_threshold and stock_level > stock_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Check if it's the last round to defect regardless of other factors
            if round_number == r:
                return 'D'
            else:
                # Consider stock level; defect if low or others are defecting
                return 'D'
```

**Explanation:**
- **Initial Round:** Start with cooperation to build a sustainable resource.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** Adapt based on others' actions. If a majority cooperate and the stock is healthy, continue Cooperating. Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate gains or prevent further depletion.
- **Last Round:** Switch to Defecting to capture maximum payoff without concern for future rounds.

This strategy encourages mutual cooperation when beneficial and adapts to exploit situations where others defect, balancing between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

The optimal strategy for each player in this scenario is to consistently cooperate. By doing so, all players maintain the resource at its maximum capacity, ensuring sustainable high payoffs for everyone over time.

$\boxed{\text{Always Cooperate}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_466 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Conservation with Responsive Defection**

**Objective:** Maximize cumulative payoff over the rounds by balancing resource conservation and strategic defection.

---

### **Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Cooperate (C):** Start with cooperation in the initial rounds to encourage others to conserve the resource, aiming for sustainable payoffs.
   - **Rationale:** Early cooperation helps maintain a healthy stock level, which is crucial for long-term gains.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Health:**
     - Calculate the stock's percentage relative to capacity (Stock / Capacity).
     - Define thresholds:
       - **High Conservation Threshold (HCT):** 70% of capacity.
       - **Low Conservation Threshold (LCT):** 30% of capacity.

   - **If Stock is Above HCT:**
     - **Cooperate (C):** Continue cooperating to sustain the resource and encourage others to do the same.
   
   - **If Stock is Between LCT and HCT:**
     - **Adaptive Strategy:**
       - Cooperate in rounds where at least 70% of other players cooperated in the previous round.
       - Defect otherwise, signaling the need for caution due to resource strain.

   - **If Stock is Below LCT:**
     - **Defect (D):** Focus on maximizing immediate payoff while attempting to reset others' strategies by reducing dependency on sustainable play.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Defect (D):** Prioritize immediate payoff as future rounds no longer exist, aiming to maximize gains without worrying about long-term sustainability.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative precedent and encourage others to maintain the resource.

2. **Last Few Rounds:**
   - Shift strategy to defecting (D) to capitalize on remaining stock without concern for future rounds.

3. **Stock at Capacity:**
   - Cooperate (C) to continue sustainable harvesting and avoid potential crashes from overconsumption.

4. **Stock Near Depletion (Below LCT):**
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff while signaling the need for others to adjust their strategies.

---

### **Collective Mindset Alignment**

- **Sustainability First:** Cooperate when the stock is healthy to maintain long-term benefits.
- **Responsive Adaptation:** Adjust actions based on stock trends and other players' behaviors, encouraging mutual adaptation towards sustainability or defecting as needed.
- **Fair Play:** Signal through cooperation or defection to influence others towards collective resource management.

---

### **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def decide_action(state, history):
    n = state['n']
    r = state['r']
    current_round = state['current_round']
    stock = state['stock']
    capacity = state['capacity']

    # Calculate thresholds
    hct = 0.7 * capacity
    lct = 0.3 * capacity

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    if current_round > 0.75 * r:
        return 'D'
    
    stock_pct = stock / capacity

    if stock_pct >= hct:
        # Cooperate
        return 'C'
    
    elif lct <= stock_pct < hct:
        # Check previous round's cooperation rate among others
        prev_actions = [action for (player, action) in history[-1] if player != self]
        coop_rate = sum(1 for a in prev_actions if a == 'C') / len(prev_actions)
        
        if coop_rate >= 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    else:  # stock < lct
        # Defect to maximize immediate payoff
        return 'D'
```

---

**Summary:** This strategy balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection in response to resource strain or nearing the end of the game. It adapts based on observable trends and encourages others to adjust their behaviors towards maintaining or exploiting the common pool resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_467 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we propose a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. This approach is adaptive and robust, designed to work without relying on coordination or communication between players.

### Strategy Overview:

The strategy begins with cooperation to maintain a high stock level, which promotes sustainable growth. It adapts based on the current stock level and the behavior of other players. If the stock is healthy and most players are cooperating, the strategy continues to cooperate. However, if the stock drops significantly or many players defect, it switches to defection to maximize immediate gains while preventing further resource depletion.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Always Cooperate to maintain a high stock level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **High Stock (Above 90% of Capacity):** Cooperate, as sustainability benefits all.
   - **Moderate Stock (Between 30%-90%):** 
     - If at least 70% of players Cooperated in the last round, continue Cooperating to sustain the resource.
     - Otherwise, Defect, as others are exploiting the resource.
   - **Low Stock (Below 30% Capacity):** Switch to Defection to maximize immediate gains.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 80%, ensuring a fair share without depletion.
   - Defect otherwise, maximizing personal gain without concern for future sustainability.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Round Adjustment:** Prioritize immediate gains when no future rounds are left.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, history, round_number, n_players, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    high_threshold = 0.9 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < low_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Consider opponent behavior in previous rounds
        recent_coop_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C')
        if recent_coop_count / n_players >= 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    # For the last round, adjust based on stock level to maximize own gain
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Conclusion:

This strategy promotes cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection only when necessary, balancing individual optimization with collective sustainability. It adapts dynamically based on observable factors, making it effective against various opponent strategies without relying on coordination mechanisms.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_468 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategic approach that balances cooperation for sustainable resource use with defecting when necessary to maximize immediate gains. This strategy is adaptive and relies solely on observable game states without assuming knowledge of other players' behaviors.

### Approach
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to promote a sustainable start.
2. **Adaptive Strategy**: For subsequent rounds (excluding the last), evaluate the current stock level:
   - If the stock is above 80% of its capacity, continue to cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains while anticipating potential resource depletion.
3. **Final Round Defection**: Always defect in the last round since there are no future rounds to benefit from maintaining resources.

This approach ensures that cooperation is maintained when it leads to sustainable outcomes and switches to defection when necessary to prevent being exploited or when resources are dwindling.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(current_stock, capacity, total_rounds, current_round):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif current_round < total_rounds:
        threshold = 0.8 * capacity
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Defect"
    else:  # Last round
        return "Defect"
```

### Explanation
- **First Round**: The strategy starts with cooperation to encourage a sustainable use of resources.
- **Subsequent Rounds (Except Last)**: By monitoring the stock level against an 80% capacity threshold, the strategy adapts. If the stock is high enough, it continues to cooperate, ensuring sustainable consumption and growth. If the stock falls below this threshold, it defects to maximize immediate gains, recognizing that resources may be depleting rapidly.
- **Last Round**: Defecting in the final round ensures maximizing one's payoff without concern for future rounds.

This approach effectively balances between cooperation for long-term benefits and defecting when necessary, ensuring adaptability based on observable game states.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_469 = '''

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_470 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we'll outline a clear strategy for managing actions in a common pool resource game based on the given considerations. This strategy aims to balance cooperation for sustainability with defecting when necessary to maximize gains.

### Approach
The strategy is divided into three phases based on the number of remaining rounds and the current state of the stock:

1. **Early Phase (First 1/3 of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate always.
   - **Rationale:** Early cooperation helps maintain a high stock level, encouraging growth and sustainable play.

2. **Middle Phase:**
   - **Action:** Monitor the average stock over recent rounds.
     - **If Average Stock > 75% of Capacity:** Continue cooperating to sustain the resource.
     - **If Average Stock ≤ 75% of Capacity:** Start defecting more frequently to maximize personal gain before potential depletion.

3. **Late Phase (Last 1/3 of Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect always.
   - **Rationale:** Near the end, defecting maximizes immediate gains as there's no future benefit from cooperation.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, total_rounds, remaining_rounds):
    early_phase = total_rounds // 3
    late_phase = 2 * (total_rounds // 3)
    
    # Early phase: always cooperate
    if remaining_rounds > early_phase:
        return "cooperate"
    
    # Late phase: always defect
    if remaining_rounds <= late_phase:
        return "defect"
    
    # Middle phase: decide based on current stock and trend
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return "cooperate"
    else:
        return "defect"
```

### Explanation
- **Early Phase:** The first third of the game focuses on cooperation to build or maintain a high stock level, which supports future growth and sustainability.
  
- **Middle Phase:** During this phase, actions are determined by the current stock relative to a threshold (75% of capacity). If the stock is above this threshold, continuing to cooperate helps sustain it. If below, defecting becomes advantageous to capitalize on remaining resources before potential depletion.

- **Late Phase:** In the final third of the game, defecting maximizes immediate gains since there are no future rounds left where cooperation would benefit.

This strategy balances between encouraging sustainable practices early and adapting to situations where defecting provides a better personal outcome, especially towards the end of the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_471 = '''
**Final Answer:**

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (ACT)

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over multiple rounds by balancing immediate gains against resource sustainability.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

#### **Cooperate (C) when:**
- The current stock level \( S \) is above a dynamically adjusted threshold \( T_{\text{coop}} \).
- OR, if defecting would lead the stock below \( T_{\text{critical}} \), which risks resource depletion.

#### **Defect (D) when:**
- The stock level \( S \) is below \( T_{\text{coop}} \), and defecting won't push it below \( T_{\text{critical}} \).
- OR, in the last few rounds (adjust based on remaining rounds), where immediate gain is prioritized.

### **2. Dynamic Thresholds**

#### **\( T_{\text{coop}} \):**
Calculated each round as:
\[ T_{\text{coop}} = \text{min}(0.75 \times \text{capacity}, S + \text{growth}) \]
Adjusts based on historical growth and current stock.

#### **\( T_{\text{critical}} \):**
Set to prevent depletion:
\[ T_{\text{critical}} = 0.25 \times \text{capacity} \]

### **3. Memory Mechanism**

- Track historical stock changes.
- If the stock has decreased significantly in recent rounds, increase \( T_{\text{coop}} \) to encourage more cooperation.

### **4. Fallback for Critical Stock**

If \( S < T_{\text{critical}} \):
- All players switch to Cooperate (C) to allow regrowth.

### **5. Edge Cases Handling**

#### **First Round:**
- Start with Cooperate (C) to build a sustainable base.

#### **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20% of rounds):**
- Gradually shift towards Defect (D), balancing immediate gains without severe depletion.

### **6. Implementation Steps**

1. **Initialize Parameters:**
   - \( T_{\text{coop}} = 0.75 \times \text{capacity} \)
   - \( T_{\text{critical}} = 0.25 \times \text{capacity} \)

2. **Each Round:**
   a. Observe current stock \( S \).
   b. Calculate thresholds.
   c. Determine action based on thresholds and historical data.

3. **Adjust Thresholds Dynamically:**
   - After each round, update thresholds based on observed behavior and stock changes.

4. **Fallback Check:**
   - If \( S < T_{\text{critical}} \), enforce cooperation for recovery.

### **7. Pseudocode**

```python
def ACT_strategy(S, history, capacity, rounds_remaining):
    # Initialize thresholds
    T_coop = 0.75 * capacity
    T_critical = 0.25 * capacity
    
    # Adjust based on historical stock changes
    if len(history) > 1:
        avg_growth = sum([h['growth'] for h in history]) / len(history)
        T_coop = min(0.75 * capacity, S + avg_growth)
    
    # Edge case: first round
    if rounds_remaining == initial_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    # Edge case: last few rounds
    if rounds_remaining <= 0.2 * total_rounds:
        if S > T_critical:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    # Decision rules
    if S >= T_coop:
        return 'C'
    elif S < T_coop and S > T_critical:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Fallback to prevent depletion
        return 'C'
```

**Conclusion:** The ACT strategy dynamically adjusts cooperation and defection based on stock levels, historical data, and remaining rounds. It prioritizes sustainability while allowing for strategic adaptation against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_472 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, a balanced strategy that considers both immediate gains and long-term sustainability is essential. The strategy should adapt to the current state of the resource and the observed behaviors of other players.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Cooperate When Stock is Low or Declining:**
   - If the stock level drops below 25% of capacity, switch to cooperation to prevent further depletion and encourage recovery.
   - Monitor recent trends; if the stock has been decreasing over several rounds, prioritize cooperation to rebuild.

2. **Defect When Stock is High and Stable:**
   - When the stock exceeds 75% of capacity, defecting becomes more attractive due to higher immediate payoffs without significant risk of collapse.
   - Stability in high stock levels allows for moderate defecting while maintaining resource health.

3. **Mixed Strategy Based on Recent Cooperation Rates:**
   - For stock levels between 25% and 75%, assess the cooperation rate from recent rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds).
   - If more than half of players cooperated recently, lean towards cooperation to sustain mutual benefits.
   - Conversely, if defection is prevalent, consider defecting more frequently to maximize immediate gains.

4. **Adjust for Game Progression:**
   - In the first few rounds and last 10% of total rounds, prioritize cooperation to build a sustainable resource base and avoid end-game collapses.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(stock, capacity, recent_actions, round_number, total_rounds):
    # Determine thresholds based on capacity
    low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity

    # Check stock level relative to thresholds
    if stock < low_threshold:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate when stock is critically low
    elif stock > high_threshold:
        return 'D'  # Defect when stock is abundant and stable

    # Calculate recent cooperation rate among players
    recent_rounds = min(5, len(recent_actions))
    cooperation_rate = sum(action == 'C' for action in recent_actions[-recent_rounds:]) / recent_rounds

    # Adjust based on cooperation rate
    if cooperation_rate > 0.5:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate if others are cooperating
    else:
        return 'D'  # Defect if defection is common

    # Edge cases for first and last rounds
    if round_number == 1 or round_number >= total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        return 'C'  # Cooperate early and late to maintain resource
```

### Explanation:

- **Low Stock Levels:** When the stock is critically low, cooperation is essential to prevent collapse. This ensures the resource can recover for future rounds.
  
- **High Stock Levels:** Abundance allows for defecting without immediate risks, maximizing personal gains while the resource remains stable.

- **Recent Cooperation Rates:** By observing recent actions, the strategy adapts dynamically. High cooperation among players signals trustworthiness, encouraging continued cooperation. Conversely, prevalent defection may warrant a more self-serving approach.

- **Game Progression:** Early rounds set the foundation for sustainability, while late rounds require caution to avoid end-game depletion. This balance ensures long-term benefits without sacrificing immediate opportunities.

This strategy effectively navigates the complexities of the game by balancing individual gains with collective resource management, fostering adaptability and resilience against diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_473 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a multi-round scenario where players can either Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), we propose a dynamic strategy that adapts based on the current state of the resource, past player behavior, and the progression of rounds. The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff while preventing unnecessary depletion of the shared resource.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation promotes sustainability and sets a positive precedent for other players.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Level and Trend:**
     - If the stock is above 80% of capacity and increasing, continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock is between 60%-80%, check recent cooperation rates:
       - If more than 70% of players have been Cooperating in the last few rounds, Cooperate.
       - Otherwise, consider Defecting to maximize immediate payoff while others are not sustaining the resource.
   - **If Stock is Below 60%:**
     - Switch to Defecting until the stock recovers or if cooperation rates increase.

3. **Late Rounds (Last ~20% of total rounds):**
   - **Tend towards Defecting:** As future consequences diminish, prioritize immediate gains.
   - **Consider Current Stock Level:**
     - If above 70%, Cooperate to maintain what's left.
     - If below 70%, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains.

4. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Use a sliding threshold that decreases from 80% in early rounds to 60% in late rounds, reflecting the reduced need for caution as fewer future rounds remain.

5. **Final Round:**
   - Evaluate whether defecting provides significant payoff without causing excessive depletion.
   - Tend towards D but consider current stock level; if very low, Cooperate cautiously.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, previous_s, cooperation_rates):
    capacity = 100  # Assuming maximum capacity is 100 units for simplicity
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    threshold = 0.8 * (1 - current_round / total_rounds) + 0.6 * (current_round / total_rounds)
    
    if current_stock > 0.8 * capacity and current_stock >= previous_s:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < 0.6 * capacity and current_stock < previous_s:
        if cooperation_rates[-1] < 0.5:  # If less than half cooperated last round
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Cooperate cautiously, maybe with a probability based on how far below threshold
            return 'C' if random.random() > (current_stock / capacity) else 'D'
    else:
        # Between 60% and 80%
        recent_coop = sum(cooperation_rates[-5:]) / 5 if len(cooperation_rates) >=5 else cooperation_rates[-1]
        if recent_coop > 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage
current_round = 10
total_rounds = 50
current_stock = 70  # 70% of capacity
previous_s = 68    # Previous stock level was 68%
cooperation_rates = [0.8, 0.75, 0.7, 0.65, 0.6]  # Cooperation rates from last 5 rounds

action = decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, previous_s, cooperation_rates)
print(f"Action: {action}")
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Rounds:** The strategy begins with Cooperate to foster a sustainable environment.
- **Middle Rounds:** It adapts based on the stock level and recent player behavior. If others are Cooperating, it continues to Cooperate; if not, it switches to Defecting to maximize immediate gains.
- **Late Rounds:** As future rounds become fewer, the strategy leans towards Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources without worrying about long-term sustainability.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold for cooperation decreases over time, allowing players to be more lenient towards defecting as the game progresses.
- **Final Round Consideration:** Balances between Cooperating and Defecting based on the current stock level to maximize payoff without unnecessary depletion.

This strategy effectively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting actions based on the current state of the resource, past behavior of other players, and the progression of rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_474 = '''
The strategy is designed to promote cooperation while adaptively responding to defection trends, ensuring sustainability and maximizing payoffs. Here's the structured approach:

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

### Overview:
- Aims to sustain the common pool resource by promoting cooperation when feasible and defecting only when necessary.
- Uses a dynamic threshold based on current stock and historical data to decide actions.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to encourage sustainability and set a positive precedent.

2. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation:**
   - **Base Threshold:** Starts at 80% of capacity in the first round.
   - **Decay Rate:** The threshold decreases by 5% each subsequent round, reaching lower values towards the end to account for diminishing future impact.
   - **Defector Tolerance Adjustment:** If more than 30% of players Defected in previous rounds, reduce the threshold further (to a minimum of 50%) to adapt to potential continued defection.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - In each round:
     - Calculate the current stock and determine if it's above the adjusted threshold.
     - If above, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate a sustainable approach.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds):** Lower the threshold more aggressively to prioritize short-term gains while considering the diminishing future impact of cooperation.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set initial cooperation = True.
   - Define base_threshold = 0.8 * capacity.
   - Set decay_rate = 0.95 (threshold decreases by 5% each round).

2. **Per Round Execution:**
   - For each round t from 1 to r:
     a. If t == 1: Cooperate.
     b. Else:
        i. Compute current stock S and proportion of Defectors in the previous round.
        ii. Adjust threshold by applying decay_rate^(remaining_rounds).
        iii. If proportion_defectors_prev > 0.3, lower the threshold to max(0.8 * base_threshold, 0.5).
        iv. If S >= (capacity * adjusted_threshold): Cooperate.
        v. Else: Defect.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def adaptive_threshold_strategy(t, r, n, capacity, stock_history, actions_history):
    if t == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate remaining rounds
    remaining = r - t + 1
    
    # Base threshold decay
    base_threshold = 0.8 * (capacity ** (remaining / r))
    adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * (0.95 ** (t-2))
    
    # Check proportion of Defectors in previous round
    prev_defectors = sum(1 for action in actions_history[-1] if action == 'D')
    proportion_defectors = prev_defectors / n
    
    # If too many defectors, lower threshold
    if proportion_defectors > 0.3:
        adjusted_threshold = max(adjusted_threshold * 0.8, 0.5 * capacity)
    
    # Decision based on current stock
    S = stock_history[-1]
    if S >= (capacity * adjusted_threshold):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage
round_number = 1
total_rounds = 10
players = 5
current_capacity = 100
stock_log = [90, 85, ...]  # Historical stock levels
past_actions = [['C', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'C'], ...]  # Past actions of each player

action = adaptive_threshold_strategy(round_number, total_rounds, players, current_capacity, stock_log, past_actions)
```

### Summary:
The ATC strategy balances sustainability and adaptability by dynamically adjusting cooperation thresholds. It starts with cooperation to build a sustainable base, then adjusts based on current stock levels and historical defection rates, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios without relying on coordination among players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_475 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Defection Thresholds**

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and maintain a healthy resource level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-10%):**
   - **Current Stock Check:** Evaluate the current stock relative to capacity.
     - If stock > 75% of capacity and recent cooperation rate (last few rounds) ≥ 60%, Cooperate.
     - If stock < 25% of capacity or cooperation rate ≤ 40%, Defect.
   - **Trend Analysis:** If neither condition is met, cooperate if the stock trend is stable or increasing; otherwise, defect.

3. **Final 10% Rounds:**
   - Shift towards Defecting to maximize immediate payoffs, considering limited future rounds and potential over-depletion by others.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - **Full Stock:** Continue Cooperating for sustainable growth.
   - **Low Stock (Near 0%):** Defection yields minimal payoff; Cooperate to preserve remaining resource.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to game state and player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_476 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Reciprocity**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Cooperate unconditionally to build a stable stock level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Monitor the current stock level relative to the capacity.
   - Track the cooperation rate of other players in recent rounds.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - If the stock is above 80% of capacity and most players cooperated in previous rounds, Cooperate.
   - If the stock drops below 60% or there's been significant defection (e.g., >50% defects in last round), Defect to signal disapproval and protect against further depletion.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - After defecting for a set number of rounds, reassess cooperation rates.
   - If others start cooperating again, revert to Cooperating if the stock is stable.

5. **Memory Mechanism:**
   - Keep track of defection history (number and frequency) to decide future actions.
   - Use a threshold based on historical data to determine when to shift strategies.

6. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - In the last few rounds, maintain cooperation if possible; if others defect, reciprocate but aim to reset cooperation in subsequent interactions if any.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```
Initialize thresholds:
    HighThreshold = 0.8 * capacity
    LowThreshold = 0.6 * capacity

Initialize state variables:
    recent_defects = []
    max_memory = 5 rounds

For each round from 1 to r:
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    if round <= 3:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(recent_defects)
        
        if current_stock >= HighThreshold and cooperation_rate > 0.75:
            action = Cooperate
        elif current_stock < LowThreshold or cooperation_rate < 0.5:
            action = Defect
        else:
            action = Cooperate
    
    record_current_action(action)
    add_defects_to_memory()
    
    if len(recent_defects) > max_memory:
        recent_defects.pop(0)
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively responding to both the resource state and others' behaviors, fostering a collective approach to resource management.

description_COLLECTIVE_477 = '''
**Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Dynamic Thresholds**

This strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection based on the current state of the common pool resource, historical player actions, and the number of rounds remaining. The goal is to maximize long-term payoffs while encouraging sustainable use of the resource.

---

### **Decision Rules**

1. **Initial Round (t=1):** 
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent and helps maintain a healthy stock level for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
   - **Step 1: Assess Stock Health (S).**
     - Calculate the current stock as a percentage of capacity.
   - **Step 2: Evaluate Historical Cooperation.**
     - Determine the proportion of players who have Cooperated in previous rounds.
   - **Step 3: Apply Thresholds.**
     - If S > 70% and more than 60% of players have Cooperated historically:
       - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Else if S < 30% or more than 40% of players have Defected in previous rounds:
       - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Step 4: Endgame Consideration.**
     - In the last 10% of rounds, prioritize Defection to maximize immediate payoffs.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round (t=1):** Always Cooperate to encourage a sustainable start.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Shift towards Defecting to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future depletion.
- **Stock Recovery Periods:** If the stock recovers significantly due to increased cooperation, reconsider Cooperating in subsequent rounds.

---

### **Collective Strategy**

This strategy is designed to align with collective interests by promoting cooperation when feasible and defecting only when necessary. It implicitly signals through actions: Cooperating helps sustain resources, while Defecting in response to others' defection prevents exploitation.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, stock, capacity, history):
    n = number_of_players()
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate stock health as a percentage of capacity
    stock_health = (stock / capacity) * 100
    
    # Evaluate historical cooperation rate among other players
    prev_cooperators = sum(1 for actions in history.values() 
                           if actions[-2] == 'C')  # Check previous round's actions
    coop_rate = prev_cooperators / n
    
    # Determine action based on thresholds and endgame condition
    if current_round >= total_rounds * 0.9:
        return 'D'
    
    if stock_health > 70 and coop_rate > 0.6:
        return 'C'
    elif stock_health < 30 or (1 - coop_rate) > 0.4:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Default to Cooperate if conditions are neutral
        return 'C'

# Example usage in a loop over rounds
for t in range(1, r+1):
    action = decide_action(t, r, stock, capacity, history)
    history[player].append(action)
```

---

**Summary:** This strategy dynamically adjusts between Cooperating and Defecting based on the current state of the resource, historical player behavior, and proximity to the end of the game. It aims to promote sustainability while protecting against exploitation, adapting to varying opponent behaviors in a tournament setting.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_478 = '''
To address the problem of determining whether to cooperate or defect in a game based on current stock levels and recent player behavior, we developed a strategy that balances immediate gains against future sustainability. This strategy takes into account both the current health of the resource (stock) and the cooperation rates observed in previous rounds.

### Approach
The approach involves dynamically adjusting thresholds for cooperation based on the current state of the game and historical cooperation rates among players. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Initial Cooperation Threshold**: At the beginning of the game, players will cooperate if the stock is above 80% of its capacity.
2. **Recent Cooperation Check**: After the initial rounds, the strategy looks at the cooperation rates in recent rounds (last three rounds). If more than 70% of players cooperated on average, the threshold remains at 80%. Otherwise, it lowers to encourage defecting.
3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: The cooperation threshold is dynamically adjusted based on observed cooperation rates, ensuring that players adapt their strategies to maintain a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

### Solution Code
Here's how the strategy can be implemented in Python:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, history, n_players, capacity):
    # Determine if it's an initial round (first 3 rounds)
    if round_number <= 3:
        cooperation_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    else:
        # Calculate average cooperation rate in the last 3 rounds
        recent_rounds = history[-3:]
        total_cooperations = sum(len([a for a in r['actions'] if a == 'C']) for r in recent_rounds)
        avg_coop_rate = total_cooperations / (n_players * 3)  # Average over the last 9 actions
        
        if avg_coop_rate > 0.7:
            cooperation_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
        else:
            cooperation_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    
    if current_stock >= cooperation_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Rounds**: For the first three rounds, players use a fixed threshold of 80% to decide whether to cooperate.
- **Recent Cooperation Check**: From the fourth round onwards, the strategy evaluates the average cooperation rate in the last three rounds. If more than 70% of players cooperated on average, it maintains the higher threshold (80%). Otherwise, it lowers the threshold to encourage defecting.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: This ensures that players adapt their behavior based on recent trends, balancing between exploiting resources when others are not cooperating and sustaining resources when cooperation is prevalent.

This approach effectively balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability by dynamically adjusting thresholds based on observed behavior, leading to a robust strategy for maintaining cooperation while protecting against exploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_479 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperative Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set cooperation mode to `True`.
   - Initialize `defect_count` to track consecutive defections.

2. **Round-by-Round Decision Making:**

   - **First Round:**
     - Cooperate (C) to start sustainably.

   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     1. **Endgame Check:**
        - In the last 10% of rounds, defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are limited.
        
     2. **Stock Level Check:**
        - If current stock is below 30% of capacity:
          - Cooperate (C) to prevent further depletion and encourage rebuilding.

     3. **Defection Rate Check:**
        - Count the number of players who Defected in the previous round.
        - If more than 30% of players Defected:
          - Switch cooperation mode to `False` (defect this round as punishment).
          - Increment `defect_count`.
        
        - Else:
          - Maintain cooperation mode (`True`) and Cooperate (C).

     4. **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
        - If consecutive defections (`defect_count`) reach a threshold of 3 rounds:
          - Reset cooperation mode to `True` and Cooperate (C) to restart cooperation.
          - Reset `defect_count` to 0.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**

   - **Stock Depletion:**
     - If the stock reaches zero, continue playing but prioritize cooperation in subsequent rounds to rebuild if possible.

   - **High Stock Levels:**
     - When stock is near capacity (above 70%), focus on defecting as punishment only when defection rates are high to prevent over-exploitation.

4. **Implementation Notes:**

   - Use dynamic thresholds based on the number of players and capacity.
   - Ensure checks prioritize critical conditions (endgame, low stock) before considering defection rates.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, n, history):
    threshold_defection = 0.3 * n  # 30% of players
    low_threshold = 0.3 * capacity  # 30% of capacity
    max_consecutive_defects = 3

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds // 10):
        return 'D'

    if current_stock < low_threshold:
        return 'C'

    defectors_last_round = count(history[-1], 'D')
    if defectors_last_round > threshold_defection:
        action = 'D'
        defect_count += 1
    else:
        action = 'C'
    
    if defect_count >= max_consecutive_defects:
        action = 'C'
        defect_count = 0

    return action
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:** Start by Cooperating to foster a sustainable environment.
- **Endgame Strategy:** In the final 10% of rounds, prioritize defecting to maximize personal gains without concern for future repercussions.
- **Stock Management:** When stock is critically low, switch to Cooperate to prevent collapse and encourage rebuilding.
- **Social Dynamics:** Punish defection by mirroring it but forgive after a set period to restart cooperation, balancing deterrence with collaboration.

This strategy adaptively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_480 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It adapts based on others' actions and aims to maintain a healthy stock level through cooperation, defecting only when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round due to high initial stock levels, promoting resource sustainability.
2. **Monitor Consumption**: After each round, calculate the total consumption and compare it to expected consumption if all players Cooperated.
3. **Adaptive Thresholding**:
   - If actual consumption exceeds expectations significantly, indicating Defectors, lower the cooperation threshold for future rounds.
   - Maintain or raise the threshold when others Cooperate, encouraging collective resource preservation.
4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Continuously adjust the cooperation threshold based on recent stock levels and consumption patterns to decide when to Cooperate or Defect.

### Pseudocode:

```python

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts by Cooperating to maintain high resource levels.
- **Monitoring and Adjustment**: After each round, evaluates others' actions. If excessive Defection is detected, lowers the threshold for future Cooperations.
- **Threshold Dynamics**: Adjusts based on observed behavior, encouraging cooperation when possible and defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion.

This strategy fosters long-term sustainability by adapting to the collective behavior of players while maximizing individual payoffs through balanced decision-making.

description_COLLECTIVE_481 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we develop a strategic approach that balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability. The strategy involves monitoring both the current stock level and the cooperation rates among players to dynamically adjust actions each round.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating in the first round to establish a sustainable resource base.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels:** After each round, evaluate the new stock level relative to previous rounds. A significant drop may indicate increased Defectors.
3. **Adjust Based on Thresholds:**
   - **High Stock (Above 80% of Capacity):** Continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability.
   - **Moderate Stock (Between 50-80%):** Check recent cooperation rates (e.g., last 5 rounds). If more than 75% of players are Cooperating, continue Cooperating; otherwise, switch to Defecting.
   - **Low Stock (Below 30%):** Start Defecting to exploit remaining resources before potential collapse.
4. **Recovery Phase:** If the stock drops significantly below critical levels, consider defecting for a few rounds to maximize immediate payoffs while preparing for potential resource depletion.

This approach ensures that players cooperate when possible, only defecting when necessary to protect against exploitation and maintain sustainable gains over the game's duration.

**Answer:**

To optimize your strategy in this scenario, start by Cooperating. Continue Cooperating if the stock remains high (above 80% of capacity) or if most other players are Cooperating recently. Switch to Defecting if the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 30%) or if too many others are defecting, indicating resource exploitation.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate initially; switch to Defecting if stock is low or others defect excessively}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_482 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we'll outline a strategy that balances immediate gains with sustainable resource management. The strategy adapts based on the current state of the stock and the behavior observed from other players.

### Approach
The strategy is divided into three zones based on the stock level relative to the capacity:

1. **High Zone (H)**: When the stock exceeds 75% of its capacity, cooperation is sustainable as growth can offset moderate consumption.
2. **Medium Zone (M)**: Between 25% and 75% of capacity, adapt decisions based on recent player behavior. If a significant proportion defect, respond by defecting to avoid exploitation; otherwise, continue cooperating.
3. **Low Zone (L)**: Below 25% capacity, defect to maximize immediate payoff as the stock is already at risk.

Additionally, in the final few rounds, switch to always defecting to maximize individual payoffs without worrying about future impacts.

### Solution Code
```python
def decision(current_stock, capacity, remaining_rounds, history):
    # Threshold definitions
    high_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity

    # Check if in the last few rounds (e.g., <=3)
    if remaining_rounds <= 3:
        return 'D'

    # Determine current zone
    if current_stock > high_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock <= low_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Medium zone: check recent defect rate among others
        recent_defect_rate = calculate_defect_rate(history)
        if recent_defect_rate > 0.3:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def calculate_defect_rate(history):
    total_actions = sum(len(round_history) for round_history in history.values())
    defect_count = sum(action == 'D' for round_history in history.values() for action in round_history)
    if total_actions == 0:
        return 0.0
    return defect_count / total_actions

# Example usage:
history = {1: ['C', 'D', 'C'], 2: ['D', 'D', 'C']}
print(decision(80, 100, 5, history))  # Output based on current state and history
```

### Explanation
- **High Zone (H)**: When the stock is above 75% of capacity, cooperation ensures sustainable growth without risking depletion.
- **Medium Zone (M)**: Flexibility is key here. By monitoring recent defect rates, the strategy adapts to exploit or avoid exploitation based on others' actions.
- **Low Zone (L)**: At low stock levels, maximizing immediate payoff through defection prevents further decline and potential collapse.

This approach ensures that the strategy is both adaptive and sustainable, aiming for long-term resource management while safeguarding against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_483 = '''
Players should cooperate when the current stock is at least 80% of its maximum capacity. If the stock falls below this threshold, players should defect to maximize their immediate gains.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the current stock is at least 80\% of the maximum; otherwise, defect.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_484 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on observable information. The goal is to maximize long-term benefits while adapting to various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Overview

The strategy begins with cooperation in the first round to maintain resource sustainability. It then adapts based on previous rounds' actions and current stock levels. The approach involves:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to preserve the resource when it is at maximum capacity.
2. **Cooperation Threshold**: Continue cooperating if a sufficient number of players (e.g., 60%) are also cooperating, ensuring collective sustainability.
3. **Defection Adjustment**: If cooperation drops below a threshold or the stock falls significantly, switch to defecting to prevent over-depletion.
4. **Dynamic Target Stock**: Maintain a dynamic target stock level; if the current stock is above this target, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
5. **Handling Final Rounds**: In the last round, consider defecting for maximum payoff but balance with potential resource crash.

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to preserve the resource at its peak capacity.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If more than 60% of players cooperated in the previous round and the stock is above a dynamic target, cooperate.
   - If cooperation drops below 40% or the stock falls significantly below the target, defect to prevent over-depletion.
3. **Dynamic Target Adjustment**: The target stock level adjusts based on historical consumption rates and recovery dynamics.

### Edge Cases

- **First Round**: Default to cooperation to maximize resource preservation.
- **Last Round**: Consider defecting if it maximizes immediate payoff without causing a crash; otherwise, cooperate if previous rounds indicate sustainable levels.
- **Stock Collapse**: If the stock drops too low, switch to defection for a few rounds before attempting cooperation again.

### Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, n, capacity, stock_history, actions_history):
    # Initial round: Cooperate by default
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate previous round's cooperation rate
    prev_round = actions_history[-1]
    coops = sum(1 for action in prev_round if action == 'C')
    coop_rate = coops / n
    
    # Determine current stock level and dynamic target
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    average_growth = calculate_average_growth(stock_history)
    target_stock = max(current_stock * 0.8, capacity * 0.5)  # Adjust based on growth rate
    
    # Decision rules
    if coop_rate > 0.6 and current_stock >= target_stock:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Summary

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by adapting to observed behaviors and resource levels. It promotes cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection when necessary, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies. The approach is designed to be implemented algorithmically, providing a dynamic and adaptive solution for the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_485 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing resource exploitation and conservation, a strategic approach is proposed that integrates cooperation with adaptive adjustments based on the current stock level and others' actions. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating to support sustainability and observe others' behavior.
2. **Dynamic Threshold for Consumption**: Use a dynamic threshold (T) to decide between Cooperate (C) and Defect (D). If the stock is above T, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.
3. **Adjusting the Threshold (T)**: Start with T set to capacity/2. After each round, adjust T based on growth trends—increasing if recovery is strong, decreasing if growth is poor.
4. **Incorporate Others' Behavior**: Track recent cooperation levels. If many Cooperate, continue Cooperating; if Defectors dominate, consider defecting more to prevent exploitation.
5. **Handle Final Rounds**: Adjust T slightly lower in the last few rounds to encourage cautious consumption and prevent sudden depletion.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C).
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate current stock level (S).
   - If S > T, Cooperate; else, Defect.
3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**:
   - Initially, T = capacity/2.
   - After each round, adjust T based on observed growth and consumption trends.
4. **Incorporate Others' Behavior**:
   - Track the proportion of Cooperators in recent rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds).
   - If high cooperation, continue Cooperating; if many Defectors, consider defecting more frequently.
5. **Final Rounds Handling**:
   - In the final few rounds (last 10% of total), lower T to encourage more cautious consumption.
6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If stock hits zero, focus on maximizing immediate payoff by Defecting.
   - At capacity, Cooperate to maintain high levels for future growth.

### Considerations and Mitigations:
- **Oscillations**: Introduce inertia or smoothing in T adjustments to prevent abrupt changes and stabilize cooperation levels.
- **Rapid Adaptation**: Use moving averages when assessing others' actions to avoid chaotic behavior.
- **Equilibrium Potential**: Shared heuristics may lead to equilibrium, maintaining a balance between exploitation and conservation.

This strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, preventing rapid resource depletion while allowing for reasonable exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_486 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we design a collective strategy that balances cooperation for long-term gains with defection as a defense mechanism against exploitation. The strategy adapts dynamically based on observed player behavior and resource levels.

### Strategy Description:

1. **Initialization:**
   - In the first round, all players cooperate to set a baseline of resource sustainability.

2. **Dynamic Cooperation Threshold:**
   - For each subsequent round, calculate the proportion of other players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - If more than 70% of other players cooperated, continue cooperating this round to maintain high payoffs and resource levels.
   - If cooperation among others drops below 70%, defect this round to maximize immediate payoff while protecting against further resource depletion.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - Track the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), switch to defecting to exploit remaining resources before potential collapse.

4. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - In the last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.

5. **Adaptive Thresholds:**
   - Adjust cooperation thresholds based on the number of players (n) and capacity to optimize resource management and exploit patterns dynamically.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decision_rule(round_number, current_stock, history_cooperations):
    n = number_of_players()
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        cooperation_rate = sum(history_cooperations) / (round_number - 1)
        critical_stock = capacity * 0.3
        
        if cooperation_rate > 0.7 and current_stock >= critical_stock:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# In the last round, always defect
if current_round == total_rounds:
    return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization:** Starting with cooperation ensures maximum initial resource preservation.
- **Cooperation Threshold:** Encourages continued cooperation when others are cooperating, promoting sustainability.
- **Defection Defense:** Defects when others exploit, preventing excessive resource depletion.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Protects against catastrophic resource collapse by switching to defection when stock is critically low.
- **Final Round Adjustment:** Maximizes immediate payoff in the final round without concern for future rounds.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and resource levels, ensuring robust performance across various opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_487 = '''
To address the problem of preventing resource depletion through cooperation, we propose a strategy that combines responsiveness to stock trends with a conservative approach to minimize the risk of collapse. This strategy balances adaptability with caution, aiming to sustain cooperation while accounting for potential defections.

### Strategy: Responsive Conservation

1. **Cooperate if Stock is Stable or Increasing**: If the current stock level is higher than or equal to the previous round's level, all players should Cooperate. This reinforces sustainable practices when the resource shows signs of stability or growth.

2. **Adapt if Stock Decreases**: 
   - **First Decrease**: If the stock decreases slightly (e.g., by less than 10% compared to the previous round), players continue to Cooperate but monitor the trend closely.
   - **Significant Drop**: If the stock drops significantly (by more than 20%), players switch to a mixed strategy where they randomly choose between Cooperating and Defecting. This introduces uncertainty, encouraging other players to reconsider their actions.

3. **Defend Against Persistent Depletion**: If the stock decreases consecutively for two rounds (e.g., each round sees a drop of more than 10%), players should collectively Defect in the following round. This serves as a punitive measure against persistent defection, signaling that such behavior is unsustainable and will be met with reciprocal actions.

4. **Rebuild Phase**: After a period of Defection leading to stock depletion (e.g., stock drops below 50%), players enter a Rebuild Phase where they exclusively Cooperate for the next three rounds. This phase aims to restore the resource level, fostering trust and cooperation among players.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Monitor Stock Levels**: Each player tracks the stock levels from round to round.
2. **Assess Trends**: Determine if the stock is increasing, stable, or decreasing by comparing current and previous levels.
3. **Apply Strategy Rules**:
   - Cooperate on stability or slight decreases.
   - Introduce randomness on significant drops.
   - Defect collectively after persistent depletion.
4. **Initiate Rebuild Phase**: If the resource depletes significantly (e.g., below 50%), all players Cooperate for the next three rounds to rebuild the stock.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Round 1**: Stock = 100. Players Cooperate; stock remains at 100.
- **Round 2**: One player defects, causing total consumption of 62.5. Stock drops to 37.5 but grows back to approximately 84.375. The slight decrease triggers monitoring.
- **Round 3**: Stock = 84.375 (slight drop from Round 1). Players Cooperate again, consuming 50 units. Stock decreases further to ~79.46875.
- **Round 4**: Significant drop detected (~29% decrease over two rounds). Players randomly choose between C and D. Suppose some defect, leading to moderate consumption.
- **Round 5**: If the stock continues to drop significantly, players collectively Defect in Round 6.
- **Round 6**: Stock plummets to near-zero due to collective Defection. Players enter Rebuild Phase.
- **Rounds 7-9**: All Cooperate, allowing the stock to gradually recover.

This strategy encourages Cooperation while incorporating safeguards against exploitation and collapse. By adapting to trends and introducing controlled variability, it promotes long-term sustainability and resilience against defection attempts.

description_COLLECTIVE_488 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - All players start by Cooperating (C). This maintains a healthy stock level and promotes future growth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Players assess the cooperation levels of previous rounds and current stock status.
     - **Cooperation Threshold:** If more than X% of players Cooperated in the last round, continue Cooperating.
     - **Defection Trigger:** If less than X% Cooperated, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff while preventing further resource depletion.
   - Adjust threshold X based on stock changes. A significant drop lowers X, encouraging more defection.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Players evaluate if defecting yields higher immediate payoff without excessive depletion.
     - Decision based on remaining rounds and current stock level.

4. **Mid-Rounds Adjustment:**
   - Players adapt cooperation levels to prevent stock collapse, using recent history to guide decisions.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Unanimous Cooperation ensures sustainable stock growth.
- **Last Round:** Calculated decision between Cooperation and Defection based on payoff vs. depletion impact.
- **Mid-Rounds:** Flexibility in strategy prevents resource collapse while maintaining long-term sustainability.

This strategy balances immediate gains with future sustainability, encouraging collective cooperation while allowing defection when necessary to prevent over-depletion.

**Adaptive Cooperation Strategy (ACS) for Common Pool Resource Game**

The Adaptive Cooperation Strategy (ACS) is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a dynamic environment. It adapts to opponents' behaviors while maintaining flexibility to prevent resource depletion.

### Key Components:

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate:** If the current stock exceeds 75% of capacity.
   - **Defect:** If the stock is below 25%, or in the last few rounds if defecting yields a higher payoff.
   - **Conditional Cooperation:** In intermediate stock levels (25%-75%), cooperate based on opponents' past actions. Cooperate with probability proportional to the historical cooperation rate of opponents, weighted more towards recent behavior.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others and set a positive precedent.
   - **Last 10% Rounds:** Cooperate if stock is high; defect if beneficial, considering limited future rounds.

3. **Collective Mindset Alignment:**
   - Emphasize long-term sustainability while adapting to changing conditions without relying on coordination.

### Strategy Description:

- **Stock Thresholds:** Cooperate above 75%, defect below 25%. In between, decide based on opponents' actions.
- **Opponent Behavior Adaptation:** Use a weighted average of past cooperation rates (favoring recent actions) to determine cooperation probability.
- **Dynamic Adjustments:** Monitor stock trends and adjust thresholds dynamically if the stock consistently decreases despite cooperation.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def ACS_strategy(stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, opponents_actions):
    # Initial conditions
    if round_number == 1:
        return C
    
    # Stock-based decisions
    if stock > 0.75 * capacity:
        return C
    elif stock < 0.25 * capacity:
        return D
    
    # Calculate cooperation threshold based on opponents' past actions
    recent_weight = 0.9  # Weight for recent rounds
    total_coop = sum([action == 'C' for action in opponents_actions])
    weighted_coop = sum([recent_weight ** (len(opponents_actions) - i -1) * (action == 'C') for i, action in enumerate(opponents_actions)])
    normalized_coop = weighted_coop / len(opponents_actions)
    
    cooperation_threshold = max(0.3, min(0.7, normalized_coop))
    
    # Decision based on threshold
    if random.random() < cooperation_threshold:
        return C
    else:
        return D
    
    # Last rounds adjustment
    if round_number > total_rounds - (total_rounds * 0.1):
        future_benefit = estimate_future_benefit(stock, capacity)
        if S/n > S/(2n) + future_benefit:
            return D
        else:
            return C
```

### Considerations:

- **Feedback Loops:** Monitor for cascading defection or cooperation and adjust thresholds to mitigate negative impacts.
- **Stock Trends:** Adjust thresholds dynamically based on stock recovery trends, especially if the resource is consistently depleting despite cooperation.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to opponents' behaviors and dynamically adjusting its approach based on the current state of the common pool resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_490 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

The strategy is designed to maximize collective payoff by balancing cooperation and defection based on current stock health and recent player actions. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reasoning: Sets a positive precedent, encouraging others to cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Health Check:**
     - Calculate `stock_health = current_stock / capacity`.
     - If `stock_health > 0.8`: 
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - Reasoning: High stock health indicates sustainability, so continue cooperation.
     - If `stock_health < 0.5`:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - Reasoning: Low stock health signals potential crash; defect to maximize immediate payoff.
     - If `0.5 ≤ stock_health ≤ 0.8`:
       - **Majority Check:**
         - Examine the previous round's actions.
         - If more than half of players Cooperated last round:
           - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
             - Reasoning: Maintain trust and encourage sustainability.
         - Else:
           - **Action:** Defect (D)
             - Reasoning: retaliate against exploitation to prevent further depletion.

3. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Monitor trends in stock levels and player behavior over rounds.
   - If despite cooperation, the stock decreases significantly, adjust thresholds to be more cautious.
   - If the stock shows recovery after cooperation, reinforce cooperative actions.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C).
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 20% of rounds):**
  - Shift towards Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are limited.
- **Stock Near Capacity (>80%):** Continue Cooperating as it's sustainable.
- **Stock Low (<50%):** Consider Defecting to prevent crash and maximize payoff.

This strategy adaptively adjusts based on current conditions, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion. It balances collective sustainability with individual payoff optimization.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_491 = '''
**Final Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Thresholds**

1. **Initialization**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage sustainability and observe others' behavior.

2. **Monitoring**: Track the stock level after each round and record other players' actions (Cooperate or Defect) in recent rounds.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - Calculate the current stock as a percentage of capacity.
   - Determine the proportion of Cooperators among all players in the last few rounds.

4. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - Set a dynamic cooperation threshold for the stock level (e.g., 75% of capacity).
   - Adjust this threshold based on observed trends: if the stock consistently recovers, increase the threshold; if it depletes, decrease it.
   - Similarly, set a cooperation rate threshold (e.g., 60% of players Cooperating) to decide whether to Cooperate or Defect.

5. **Action Selection**:
   - If the current stock is above the dynamic threshold and more than the specified proportion of players Cooperated in recent rounds, Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect to prevent further resource depletion or capitalize on others' actions.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **Last Round**: Consider defecting if it maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
   - **Low Stock**: If the stock is critically low, prioritize Defecting to secure remaining resources.

7. **Testing and Adaptation**: Occasionally test cooperation even when conditions suggest defection to potentially restart cooperative behavior among players.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, previous_actions, round_number):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    stock_threshold = calculate_dynamic_threshold()
    coop_proportion = get_cooperation_proportion(previous_actions)
    
    if current_stock > stock_threshold and coop_proportion > cooperation_rate_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def calculate_dynamic_threshold():
    # Logic to adjust threshold based on historical data
    pass

def get_cooperation_proportion(actions):
    # Calculate the proportion of Cooperators in recent rounds
    pass
```

This strategy balances individual self-interest with group sustainability, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and player behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_492 = '''
The strategy involves evaluating both the current stock level and the cooperation rate among players in previous rounds. Here's how each player should decide their action:

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to help maintain the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Check if the current stock is above a defined threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) and whether more than a certain percentage of players cooperated in the last round.
   - If both conditions are met, Cooperate again.
   - Otherwise, Defect.

This approach balances sustainability with self-interest by encouraging cooperation when it's prevalent and beneficial, while allowing for defection when others are not cooperating to maximize personal gain.

**Answer:**

Each player will cooperate if the current stock is above 80% of capacity and more than 60% of players cooperated in the last round; otherwise, they will defect. This strategy balances resource preservation with individual gain.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the stock is above 80% and at least 60% of others Cooperated; else Defect}}$

description_COLLECTIVE_493 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative Strategy (ACS)

**Objective:** Maximize collective payoff by balancing current consumption with future resource sustainability through adaptive cooperation based on stock levels and historical player behavior.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Reasoning: Start with cooperation to maintain a healthy stock level, allowing for sustainable growth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Step 1:** Assess the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If `stock > 0.8 * capacity`: Cooperate (C).
       - Reasoning: High stock ensures future sustainability, so moderate consumption is preferred.
     - Else if `0.5 * capacity ≤ stock ≤ 0.8 * capacity`:
       - Check cooperation rate from the previous round.
         - If `cooperation_rate > 60%`: Cooperate (C).
           - Reasoning: Maintain cooperation to rebuild or maintain stock near optimal growth levels.
         - Else: Defect (D).
           - Reasoning: Low cooperation indicates potential overconsumption, so defect to maximize immediate payoff while others cooperate.
     - Else (`stock < 0.5 * capacity`):
       - Check cooperation rate from the previous round.
         - If `cooperation_rate > 70%`: Cooperate (C).
           - Reasoning: High cooperation suggests others are rebuilding; join efforts to recover stock.
         - Else: Defect (D).
           - Reasoning: Low cooperation implies continued overconsumption, so defect to maximize payoff.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of total rounds):**
   - Adjust strategy to focus on maximizing immediate payoff with cautious cooperation:
     - If `stock > 0.8 * capacity`: Cooperate (C).
       - Reasoning: High stock allows for moderate consumption without significant impact.
     - Else: Defect (D).
       - Reasoning: Limited future rounds reduce incentive to rebuild; prioritize current payoff.

---

### **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with cooperation in Round 1.

2. **Observation and Calculation:**
   - After each round, observe others' actions to calculate the cooperation rate (`cooperation_rate = number_of_C / n`).

3. **Stock Check:**
   - Compare current stock against predefined thresholds (80%, 50%) of capacity to determine the resource's health.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Apply the above rules based on observed cooperation rates and stock levels to decide between C or D for the next round.

5. **Adjustment Near Game End:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds, prioritize immediate payoff by defecting unless stock is exceptionally high.

---

### **Rationale:**

- **Sustainability:** Cooperate when the resource is healthy to ensure long-term sustainability and growth.
- **Rebuilding Efforts:** Cooperate in stressed conditions only if a significant majority are also cooperating, fostering collective rebuilding.
- **Immediate Payoff:** Defect when cooperation is low or near game end to maximize current benefits, especially when future opportunities are limited.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively responding to both resource health and peer behavior.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_494 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on the game's dynamics and players' behaviors. The strategy is designed to sustain the common pool resource while preventing exploitation.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage sustainability and build trust.
2. **Monitor Behavior**: Observe other players' actions over time. If a significant number defect, consider switching strategies to prevent resource depletion.
3. **Adaptive Play**:
   - **Cooperate** if most players are cooperating and the stock is stable or high.
   - **Defect** if many players defect and the stock is low to avoid further depletion.
4. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last few rounds, switch to defecting more frequently to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, past_actions):
    n = number_of_players()
    capacity = get_capacity()

    if round_number <= 2:  # First few rounds
        return 'C'
    
    recent_past = past_actions[-min(5, len(past_actions)):]  # Look at last 5 rounds or fewer
    
    # Count cooperation in recent past
    num_coop = sum(1 for actions in recent_past for a in actions if a == 'C')
    total_actions = n * len(recent_past)
    
    # Percentage of cooperative actions
    coop_ratio = num_coop / total_actions if total_actions > 0 else 1.0

    stock_depletion = capacity - current_stock

    if round_number >= total_rounds - 2:  # Last few rounds
        return 'D'
    
    if coop_ratio > 0.7 and current_stock > capacity * 0.6:
        # If most are cooperating and stock is healthy
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock < capacity * 0.4 or (stock_depletion / capacity) > 0.5:
        # Stock is low, prevent further crash by defecting to signal
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Mix based on others' behavior
        if coop_ratio > 0.5:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage in each round:
action = decide_action(current_round, r, stock_level, history_of_actions)
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to maintain the resource and encourage others to do the same.
- **Behavior Monitoring**: By observing past actions, the strategy adapts. If most players cooperate, it continues cooperating; if many defect, it responds accordingly.
- **Stock Consideration**: The decision considers the current stock level, switching to defection when necessary to prevent depletion or signal others to conserve resources.
- **Endgame Adjustment**: Recognizing that future payoffs are limited in the last few rounds, the strategy prioritizes immediate gains through defection.

This approach balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, adapting dynamically to other players' strategies and the game's evolving state.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_495 = '''
To address the problem, we need to design a robust and adaptive strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by observing the state (current stock level) and history (past actions affecting the stock). The solution involves dynamically adjusting behavior based on these factors.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first few rounds to establish a baseline of trust and encourage others to do the same, promoting higher payoffs for all.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track changes in the stock level from round to round. This helps determine if cooperation is effective or if defects are occurring.

3. **Dynamic Thresholds:**
   - If the current_stock is above 75% of capacity, continue Cooperating as it indicates a healthy resource level.
   - If the current_stock drops below 25% of capacity, switch to Cooperating again to allow recovery and avoid depleting the resource.

4. **Adaptive Defection in Mid Range:**
   - When the stock is between 25% and 75% of capacity, defect to reduce consumption and potentially encourage others to do the same, thereby conserving the resource for future rounds.

5. **Late Game Adjustment:** As rounds near the end (last few), prioritize immediate payoffs by defecting more frequently since there's no future benefit to preserving the stock.

**Final Answer:**

The strategy is a balance of cooperation and defection based on current stock levels, encouraging sustainability while adapting to observed behavior. Here’s the structured approach:

- **Cooperate** when the current_stock exceeds 75% of capacity.
- **Defect** when the current_stock is between 25% and 75% of capacity.
- **Cooperate** again if the stock falls below 25% to allow recovery.

This strategy ensures resource sustainability while responding to observed trends in stock levels. 

$\boxed{\text{Use a threshold-based strategy where cooperation occurs above 75% and below 25% of capacity, defecting otherwise.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_496 = '''
The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance resource sustainability with individual payoff maximization. It adapts dynamically based on the game state, historical cooperation rates, and the number of rounds remaining.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 75% of capacity. This sets a positive precedent for resource conservation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Observe current stock (S) and the cooperation rate from previous rounds.
   - Calculate a dynamic threshold based on S, rounds remaining, and past cooperation rates.
   - Cooperate if S exceeds this threshold; otherwise, Defect.

3. **Adjusting Thresholds:**
   - If the historical cooperation rate is high (>50%), slightly decrease the threshold to encourage more Cooperation.
   - If the cooperation rate is low (<30%), increase the threshold to prompt others to Cooperate.

4. **Endgame Considerations:**
   - Gradually lower the threshold as rounds progress towards the end, prioritizing immediate gains in later stages.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate due to maximum stock.
   - In the last few rounds, be more inclined to Defect for higher immediate payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```pseudocode
function decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, history_cooperation_rate):
    if round_number == 1:
        return C

    threshold = initial_threshold * capacity
    threshold_adjustment = 0.75 - (round_number / total_rounds) * 0.25
    adjusted_threshold = threshold + threshold_adjustment

    if current_stock > adjusted_threshold:
        action = C
    else:
        action = D

    # Adjust for cooperation rate in previous rounds
    if history_cooperation_rate > 50%:
        adjusted_threshold *= 0.95
    elif history_cooperation_rate < 30%:
        adjusted_threshold *= 1.05

    return C if current_stock > adjusted_threshold else D
```

### Key Considerations:

- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust thresholds based on rounds remaining and historical cooperation to balance resource use.
- **Collective Behavior:** Encourage Cooperation by mirroring others' actions, fostering a cooperative environment.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Shift towards Defection in later rounds to maximize immediate payoffs.

This strategy aims to sustain the common pool resource while adapting to different opponent behaviors, ensuring both individual and collective benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_497 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable resource while protecting against exploitation by other players, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with defection based on current conditions. The strategy starts with cooperation to maintain a high stock level but adapts by defecting if either the stock is in danger or too many opponents are defecting. In the final round, defecting maximizes immediate payoff.

### Approach

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating to preserve the resource.
2. **Adaptive Play**:
   - Monitor the current stock level after each round.
   - Track the recent defection rate among opponents.
   - If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) or if more than 30% of opponents have recently defected, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds.
3. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, defect to maximize your payoff since future rounds do not exist.

### Solution Code

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_history, opponent_actions):
    capacity = 100  # Example capacity; adjust based on actual game parameters
    n_players = len(opponent_actions[0]) + 1  # Including self
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        current_stock = stock_history[-1]
        critical_level = capacity * 0.5  # Critical threshold
        
        # Check if stock is below the critical level
        if current_stock < critical_level:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Determine recent defection rate among opponents
            k_recent = min(2, len(opponent_actions))  # Look back at last 2 rounds
            total_defects = sum([action.count('D') for action in opponent_actions[-k_recent:]])
            defect_rate = total_defects / (n_players * k_recent)
            
            if defect_rate > 0.3:  # If more than 30% recent defects, defect
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
    
    # For the last round, always defect
    if round_number == len(stock_history):
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts by cooperating to maintain a high stock level, encouraging others to do the same.
- **Stock Monitoring**: After each round, the current stock is checked. If it drops below 50% of capacity, indicating potential overuse, the player defects to prevent further depletion.
- **Defection Rate Tracking**: The strategy monitors how many opponents have defected in recent rounds. If more than 30% of opponents are defecting, the player also defects to avoid being exploited and to maximize their payoff.
- **Final Round Handling**: In the last round, the player defects to ensure maximum immediate gain since there are no future rounds left.

This approach ensures that the player adapts to changing conditions, balancing between maintaining the resource for sustainability and protecting against exploitation by other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_498 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for each player in this game, we consider the following steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players cooperate to maintain the resource level at capacity.

2. **Monitor for Defection**: For each subsequent round before the last, players check if the stock has remained at capacity. If it has, they continue cooperating; otherwise, they defect.

3. **Final Round Defection**: Regardless of prior cooperation, in the final round, all players defect to maximize their individual payoffs without worrying about future consequences.

**Answer:**

Each player will cooperate in all rounds except the last one, where they will defect. Thus, the strategy is:

- Cooperate in every round except the final one.
  
In LaTeX notation, the optimal strategy for each player can be expressed as:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate until the last round, then defect}}$

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy aims to balance cooperation with defection based on observed game dynamics, ensuring sustainability and maximizing payoffs.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: Cooperate or Defect?**
- **Initial Rounds (First Round):** Always Cooperate to encourage resource stability.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - **Cooperate** if the remaining stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity) and defection rates are low.
  - **Defect** if the stock falls below the critical threshold or if a significant number of players defect in recent rounds.

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a positive precedent.
- **Last Few Rounds (Final 10% of rounds):** Consider defecting to maximize individual payoffs as future cooperation is unlikely.
- **Low Stock Levels (<25% Capacity):** Defect to prevent further depletion and secure higher immediate gains.

### **3. Adaptive Mechanisms**
- **Thresholds:** 
  - Critical stock level: 25% of capacity.
  - Defection threshold: If more than 30% of players defect in recent rounds, switch to Defecting.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Track the remaining stock after each round's consumption and growth. If it consistently falls below sustainable levels, adjust strategy towards defection.

### **4. Pseudocode Implementation**
```python
def decision_rule(current_stock, history, n, capacity, r):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Calculate recent rounds to consider (e.g., last 5 rounds)
    recent_history = history[-min(len(history), 5):]
    total_defectors = sum([sum(actions == 'D') for actions in recent_history])
    avg_defectors_per_round = total_defectors / len(recent_history) if recent_history else 0
    
    # Check stock after last round's consumption and growth
    last_stock_after = history[-1]['stock_after']
    
    # Decision logic
    if last_stock_after < capacity * 0.25:
        return "Defect"
    elif avg_defectors_per_round > n * 0.3:  # If >30% defect recently
        return "Defect"
    else:
        # Check if current stock is sustainable
        if current_stock >= capacity * 0.5:  # Sustainable level
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Defect"
```

### **5. Robustness and Adaptability**
- The strategy adapts based on observed defection rates and stock levels, ensuring it can respond to various player behaviors without relying on coordination.
- By monitoring both consumption patterns and stock dynamics, the strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

This strategy aims to maximize collective payoffs while being resilient to different opponent strategies, ensuring adaptability across a wide range of game conditions.

The strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to maximize collective payoff while ensuring sustainable use of the common pool. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to maintain high stock levels and set a baseline for sustainability.

2. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - **High Stock (Above 80% Capacity)**: Allow defection, but limit it to prevent excessive depletion.
   - **Low Stock (Below 60% Capacity)**: Enforce cooperation to rebuild the resource.

3. **Reciprocity and Adaptation**:
   - Monitor past actions of other players. If most have cooperated recently, continue cooperating.
   - If many defect, consider defecting but avoid overexploitation to prevent collapse.

4. **Endgame Handling**:
   - In the last few rounds, focus on cooperation to maintain sustainability unless forced otherwise by others' defection.

5. **Critical Stock Management**:
   - If stock drops below 30%, strictly enforce cooperation to allow recovery through growth.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decision_rule(current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    # Initial round: Cooperate to maintain high stock
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Check current stock relative to capacity
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    
    # Define thresholds dynamically based on stock and history
    cooperation_threshold = max(0.6, min(0.8, (current_stock + growth)/capacity))
    
    # Determine if others have mostly cooperated recently
    recent_coop = sum([1 for action in history[-5:] if action == 'C']) / 5
    
    # Decision logic
    if stock_ratio > cooperation_threshold:
        # Allow some defection but not too much
        if random.random() < 0.3 * (1 - recent_coop):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif stock_ratio <= cooperation_threshold and stock_ratio >= 0.6:
        # Encourage cooperation based on others' behavior
        if recent_coop > 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        # Strict cooperation to rebuild stock
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Ensures the game starts with a stable resource level.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust based on current stock and historical context, promoting sustainable use.
- **Reciprocity**: Encourages mutual cooperation by adapting to others' actions, fostering a cooperative environment.
- **Endgame Handling**: Maintains sustainability focus even in later rounds to avoid abrupt collapses.
- **Critical Stock Management**: Ensures recovery when the resource is severely depleted.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors and ensuring collective success.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_501 = '''
To address the problem, we propose a strategic approach that focuses on maintaining sustainability by monitoring the stock level. Here's a structured summary:

### Approach
1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to maintain a high initial stock, promoting resource sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Last Round Check**: If it is the last round, defect to maximize immediate gain since there are no future rounds.
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: Establish a safe threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity). 
     - **Above Threshold**: Cooperate to sustain the resource and ensure long-term benefits.
     - **Below or Equal Threshold**: Defect to maximize gains as the resource is already stressed.

This strategy prioritizes the common resource state over individual actions, promoting a sustainable approach while being robust against varying opponent behaviors.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, previous_actions):
    # First round: Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # Last round: Defect
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'Defect'
    
    # Safe threshold is set at 50% of capacity
    safe_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    # If current stock is above the safe threshold, Cooperate
    if current_stock > safe_threshold:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, we maintain a high stock level, encouraging sustainable resource use.
- **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: The strategy uses a fixed threshold to decide actions based on the current stock. This ensures that resources are used sustainably when possible and exploited when necessary.
- **Adaptation to Final Round**: Recognizing the final round allows players to defect without worrying about future consequences, optimizing immediate gains.

This approach balances sustainability with individual gain optimization, making it robust against varying behaviors in multi-player settings.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_502 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining sustainable cooperation in a multi-round game where each player's decision affects shared resources, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances resource health with social cooperation. This strategy dynamically adjusts based on current conditions and historical behavior.

### Approach
The approach involves three key components:

1. **Current Stock Check**: Evaluate whether the stock level is sufficient to support sustainable cooperation.
2. **Recent Cooperation Rate**: Assess the proportion of players who have Cooperated in recent rounds to gauge collaborative willingness.
3. **Recovery Mechanism**: Address extreme cases where the resource is severely depleted by temporarily prioritizing cooperation.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Action (First Round)**: 
   - **Cooperate** to start with a positive action that supports resource health and sets a cooperative tone.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Check for Severe Depletion**: If the current stock level \( S \) is below 30% of capacity (\( T_{\text{recovery}} = 0.3 \times \text{capacity} \)), enter a recovery phase.
     - In recovery mode, **Cooperate** for the next two rounds to attempt rebuilding the resource, regardless of others' actions.

   - **Assess Stock and Cooperation Rate**: If \( S \) is above 60% of capacity (\( T = 0.6 \times \text{capacity} \)) and at least 70% of players Cooperated in the last three rounds, **Cooperate**.
     - This threshold ensures cooperation occurs when both resource health and social willingness are sufficient.

   - **Defect Otherwise**: If either the stock is too low or insufficient others Cooperate, **Defect** to maximize immediate payoff while avoiding further depletion.

### Edge Cases Handling
- **First Round**: Always **Cooperate** to encourage a positive start.
- **Last Round**: Apply the same decision rules; though there's no future beyond this round, maintaining cooperative behavior supports sustainability in hypothetical extensions.
- **Extreme Low Stock**: Use recovery mode to break cycles of mutual defection and rebuild resource levels.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, recent_coop_history):
    """
    Determines whether to Cooperate or Defect based on current stock level,
    capacity, and recent cooperation history.
    
    Parameters:
        current_stock (float): Current level of the shared resource.
        capacity (float): Maximum possible value of the shared resource.
        recent_coop_history (list of floats): List containing the proportion
            of Cooperators in each of the last few rounds.
            
    Returns:
        str: 'Cooperate' or 'Defect'
    """
    T_recovery = 0.3 * capacity
    recovery_rounds = 2
    T = 0.6 * capacity
    P = 0.7
    
    # Check if we need to enter recovery mode
    if current_stock < T_recovery:
        return 'Cooperate'
    
    # Calculate the average cooperation rate in recent rounds
    avg_coop = sum(recent_coop_history) / len(recent_coop_history)
    
    # Decision based on stock and cooperation rate
    if current_stock >= T and avg_coop >= P:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'
```

### Explanation
The strategy is designed to maintain sustainability by only Cooperating when it's safe for the resource and others are likely to do so. It includes a recovery mechanism to handle extreme low stock situations, encouraging others to also Cooperate. By dynamically adjusting based on current conditions and historical behavior, this approach promotes long-term collaborative outcomes while protecting against exploitation by Defectors.

This solution effectively balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, ensuring that cooperation is both rewarding and resilient against disruptions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_503 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a structured collective strategy that balances cooperation for sustainability and defection to maximize payoffs. Here's how it works:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Early Game Strategy (First Half of the Rounds):**
   - **Cooperate** if the stock level (S) is above 80% of capacity.
   - **Defect** otherwise.

2. **Middle Game Strategy (Second Quarter to Three-Quarters Through):**
   - **Cooperate** if S exceeds 70%.
   - **Defect** otherwise.
   - Implement **hysteresis**: Continue the previous action for one additional round if crossing the threshold, preventing rapid switching.

3. **Late Game Strategy (Last Quarter of Rounds):**
   - Always **defect** to prioritize immediate payoffs with limited time left for regrowth.

### Final Answer

The strategy is as follows:

- In the **first half**, cooperate when S > 80%, else defect.
- From **second quarter to three-quarters**, cooperate if S > 70%; use hysteresis to avoid rapid switching.
- In the **last quarter**, always defect.

This approach ensures sustainable resource management while adapting to depletion and maximizing payoffs near the end. The strategy is encapsulated as:

\boxed{
\text{Cooperate when } S > \begin{cases} 
80\% & \text{(Early Game)} \\
70\% & \text{(Middle Game)}
\end{cases}
\text{; else defect. Always defect in Late Game. Use hysteresis in Middle Game.}
}

### Final Answer

The optimal strategy is:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate when } S > 80\% \text{ (Early), } 70\% \text{ (Middle); Defect otherwise and always in Late Game.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_504 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with resource sustainability in an anonymous, multi-player setting without communication, we propose a strategy based on observing the current stock level relative to a predetermined threshold.

**Strategy:**

- **Cooperate:** If the current stock level is greater than half of the maximum capacity (i.e., stock > capacity / 2).
- **Defect:** Otherwise.

This approach encourages cooperation when resources are abundant, fostering sustainability. When the resource depletes below this threshold, players switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains, acknowledging that further cooperation may no longer sustain the resource adequately.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine Threshold:** Set the threshold at half of the maximum capacity (capacity / 2).
2. **Current Stock Check:** At each decision point, observe the current stock level.
3. **Decision Making:**
   - If stock > capacity / 2 → Cooperate.
   - Else → Defect.

**Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate when the resource stock exceeds half of its maximum capacity and defect otherwise. 

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock} > \frac{\text{capacity}}{2}, \text{else defect}}$
