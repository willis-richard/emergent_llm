**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and maximize long-term sustainability.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - **Monitor Previous Actions:** Track the number of players who cooperated (C) or defected (D) in the last round.
  - **Stock Level Check:** Assess if the current stock is above a defined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
  - **Cooperation Threshold:** Determine if at least a certain percentage (e.g., 70%) of players cooperated in the previous round.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - If both the stock level and cooperation thresholds are met, cooperate.
  - If either threshold is not met, defect to conserve resources or punish defectors.
  
**2. Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Last Round:** Continue cooperating if the strategy has maintained a healthy stock level; otherwise, defect strategically to balance immediate gain with sustainability.

- **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize cooperation when the stock is below the threshold to allow recovery, even if others have defected recently.

**3. Adaptive Mechanisms:**

- **Reciprocity:** Cooperate unless recent history shows significant defection or low stock levels.
- **Forgiveness:** Revert to cooperation after periods of punishment if others start cooperating again and stock recovers.

**Pseudocode Logic:**

```
Initialize:
    cooperate = True

For each round from 1 to r:
    If first round:
        choose C
    Else:
        previous_cooperations = count of C in last round
        cooperation_threshold = 0.7 * n
        stock_level = current_stock / capacity
        
        if stock_level > 0.5 and previous_cooperations >= cooperation_threshold:
            choose C
        else:
            choose D

    Observe others' actions and update history
```

**4. Collective Alignment:**

- Encourages mutual cooperation by starting with trust.
- Adapts to group behavior, ensuring sustainability through dynamic adjustments based on stock health and collective action.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective well-being, fostering a sustainable approach that adapts to various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_2 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can outline a structured approach that balances cooperation and adaptive responses to maintain a healthy stock level while discouraging excessive defection. Here's the organized strategy:

### Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Forgiveness (ACF)

**Objective:**  
Maximize each player's total payoff by promoting sustained cooperation while adaptively responding to defections and maintaining a healthy common pool.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

#### **First Round**
- **Action**: Cooperate (C)
  - Rationale: Establishes an initial cooperative tone, maximizing the stock for future rounds.

#### **Subsequent Rounds**
1. **Stock Level Check**:
   - If the current stock level (`S`) is below half of the capacity (`capacity / 2`), choose to Cooperate (C).
     - Purpose: Prioritize replenishing the stock to prevent depletion.

2. **Defection Threshold**:
   - After ensuring the stock isn't critically low, assess the number of players who defected in the previous round (`d_last`).
   - If `d_last > n / 2`, choose to Defect (D) as a punishment.
     - This threshold serves as a trigger for collective retaliation against widespread defection.

3. **Forgiveness Mechanism**:
   - Maintain a counter (`punish_count`) to track consecutive punitive actions.
   - After a series of cooperative rounds by others, gradually reduce `punish_count` and revert to cooperation.
     - Example: If `d_last = 0` for a set number of rounds, reset `punish_count` and resume cooperating.

---

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**

#### **First Round**
- Cooperate unconditionally to start on a positive note and ensure the stock remains robust for subsequent rounds.

#### **Last Round**
- If previous rounds were predominantly cooperative and the stock is healthy, continue cooperating.
  - Rationale: Avoid unnecessary depletion since mutual cooperation in earlier rounds likely maintained a sustainable stock level.

#### **Low Stock Scenario**
- When `S` drops below `capacity / 2`, prioritize cooperation to allow recovery, even if past defections occurred.
  - This ensures the resource isn't over-exploited and remains viable for future rounds.

---

### **3. Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_strategy(n, capacity, r):
    # Initialize variables
    cooperate = True
    punish_count = 0
    stock_history = [capacity]  # Initial stock
    
    actions = []
    
    for t in range(1, r + 1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            S = stock_history[-1]
            
            if S < capacity / 2:
                action = 'C'
                punish_count = max(0, punish_count - 1)
            else:
                d_last = sum(1 for a in previous_actions if a == 'D')
                
                if d_last > n / 2:
                    action = 'D'
                    punish_count += 1
                else:
                    action = 'C'
                    if d_last == 0 and punish_count > 0:
                        punish_count = max(0, punish_count - 1)
        
        actions.append(action)
        stock_history.append(update_stock(stock_history[-1], actions))
    
    return actions

def update_stock(current_stock, actions):
    total_consumption = sum(
        current_stock / (2 * n) if a == 'C' else current_stock / n
        for a in actions
    )
    
    S_remaining = max(0, current_stock - total_consumption)
    growth = 2 * S_remaining * (1 - S_remaining / capacity)
    new_stock = min(S_remaining + growth, capacity)
    
    return new_stock
```

---

### **4. Explanation and Rationale**

- **Cooperation in the First Round**: Sets a cooperative foundation, ensuring maximum initial stock for future sustainability.
- **Stock Level Monitoring**: Prioritizes resource replenishment when the stock is low, preventing irreversible depletion.
- **Defection Punishment**: Acts as a deterrent against excessive defection by reducing immediate gains for defectors through retaliatory actions.
- **Forgiveness Mechanism**: Allows for recovery of cooperation if players return to cooperative behavior, fostering long-term collective benefit.

This strategy balances individual incentives with collective well-being, ensuring that while players can defect when necessary, there are mechanisms in place to restore cooperation and maintain the resource's health.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_3 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can implement an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observed behavior and game state. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview
1. **First Round Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating to establish a high stock level from the beginning.
2. **Adaptive Cooperation (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - Observe the number of defectors in the previous round.
   - Calculate the total consumption and compare it against a sustainability threshold (half the current stock).
   - If past consumption was unsustainable, defect in the current round; otherwise, continue cooperating.
3. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, all players defect to maximize their immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

### Detailed Strategy
1. **First Round**:
   - All players Cooperate (C) to start with a high stock level and moderate payoffs.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - For each round, evaluate the previous round's total consumption.
   - If the total consumption exceeded half of the previous stock, indicating excessive defection, the player will Defect (D) in the current round.
   - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).

3. **Final Round (Round r)**:
   - All players Defect (D) to maximize their final payoff since there are no subsequent rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation
```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return 'C'
    else:
        current_round = len(history)
        if current_round < r:  # Not the last round yet
            previous_actions = history[-1]['actions']
            d_prev = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
            s_prev = history[-1]['stock_before']
            
            # Calculate total consumption from previous round
            c_total = (d_prev * (s_prev / n)) + ((n - d_prev) * (s_prev / (2 * n)))
            
            if c_total > s_prev / 2:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        else:  # Last round, always defect
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation
- **First Round**: Cooperation ensures the stock remains at capacity, setting a positive trajectory.
- **Adaptive Rounds**: By checking past consumption against a sustainability threshold, players adjust their strategy to prevent over-depletion, promoting long-term resource health.
- **Final Round**: Defection in the last round maximizes immediate gain without affecting future rounds.

This strategy encourages cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection when necessary, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_4 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in a commons dilemma with perfect information, we can design a strategy that balances cooperation for sustainability with self-interest when the commons are being over-exploited. The strategy uses observable stock levels relative to capacity as the key indicator.

### Strategy:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C). This initiates the game with maximum cooperation, aiming to maintain the stock at its highest level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**: Observe the stock level after growth from the previous round:
   - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, continue to Cooperate (C).
   - If the stock drops below or equals 75% of capacity, switch to Defecting (D) to secure higher personal payoffs while the stock is still sufficient.

### Explanation:

- **Cooperation Threshold**: By setting a threshold at 75%, we ensure that as long as the stock remains healthy, cooperation continues. This maintains sustainability and maximizes collective payoff.
- **Defection Trigger**: When the stock falls below 75%, it indicates potential over-exploitation. Defecting then becomes rational to avoid being exploited by others while securing personal gains before the stock depletes further.

### Example:

- If all players follow this strategy:
  - The stock remains at capacity (e.g., 100 units), and everyone continues to cooperate.
  - This leads to a stable, high-yield outcome for all participants.
  
- If some players defect:
  - The stock may drop below the threshold in subsequent rounds.
  - Once the stock crosses below 75%, all players switch to defecting, leading to potential rapid depletion but ensuring individuals aren't disproportionately disadvantaged.

This strategy is simple yet effective, leveraging observable data and a clear rule to guide decision-making.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_5 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACST)**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale**: Establish a high initial stock level by starting with cooperation, promoting trust and maximizing growth.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Penultimate Round)**:
   - **Cooperate (C) if** both the following conditions are met:
     - The current stock is above 70% of capacity.
     - More than half of the players cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Defect (D) if** either condition is not met.
   - **Rationale**: Maintain cooperation when the stock is healthy and most players are cooperating, ensuring sustainability.

3. **Last Round Action**: Always Defect (D)
   - **Rationale**: Maximize immediate payoff in the final round since there’s no future stock to preserve.

**Additional Considerations**:
- Track past defections to determine strategic switches.
- If stock drops below 70% capacity, defect to protect payoffs.
- Strategy is adaptive based on game state and history, aiming for a balance between cooperation and self-interest.

This strategy encourages initial cooperation to build a robust stock level while being prepared to defect when sustainability is threatened or in the final round.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_6 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative foundation, encouraging others to follow suit.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - **Defection Response:** If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round. This discourages excessive exploitation.
     - **Stock Health Monitor:** Track the stock level after each round. If it falls below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains before depletion.
   - **Near Last Rounds:** In the final three rounds, prioritize personal gain by defecting, as future stock conservation becomes less relevant.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and maintain a healthy stock for future rounds.
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds):** Switch to defecting to maximize personal payoffs without concern for future stock sustainability.
   
**3. Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy encourages cooperation initially to sustain the common resource, ensuring long-term benefits for all players.
   - Adaptive responses based on others' actions and stock levels promote fairness and discourage exploitation.

This approach balances initial cooperation with adaptive defection, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors while preserving the stock for as long as beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_7 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we developed an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maintain stock levels while maximizing individual payoffs. The strategy is outlined below:

### Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment and Recovery

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of trust and maximize the initial stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Stock Levels**: If the stock after the last round drops below 50% of capacity, switch to cooperation to allow recovery.
   - **Assess Cooperation Rate**: Calculate the number of players who cooperated in the previous round. If at least 75% cooperated, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect as a punitive measure.

3. **Final Round (Last Round)**: Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences beyond the current game.

4. **Recovery Phase**: Prioritize cooperation if the stock is low to ensure sustainability for future rounds.

### Decision Rules in Pseudocode

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, current_round, stock_last, previous_actions):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Check if stock needs recovery
        if stock_last < (0.5 * capacity):
            return 'C'
        # Calculate cooperation rate from last round
        cooperators = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'C')
        cooperation_rate = cooperators / n
        if cooperation_rate >= 0.75:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and maintains the stock.
- **Punishment Mechanism**: Defecting when too few cooperate encourages others to revert to cooperative behavior.
- **Stock Recovery**: Cooperating when the stock is low ensures future rounds have sufficient resources.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Defecting in the final round maximizes immediate gain without concern for future stock levels.

This strategy promotes sustainability while adapting to others' actions, ensuring both individual and collective benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_8 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to adapt based on the game's state and history, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors. It aims to balance cooperation and defection to maximize collective payoffs while preserving the resource.

### Strategy Components:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative pattern and preserve the stock.

2. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - Track the stock level after each round.
   - Use three thresholds relative to capacity:
     - **Threshold 1:** 75% of capacity
     - **Threshold 2:** 50% of capacity

3. **Decision Rules Based on Stock Levels:**
   - If the stock is above Threshold 1 and increasing, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock is between Threshold 2 and Threshold 1 but stable or slightly decreasing, monitor closely and consider cooperation.
   - If the stock drops below Threshold 2, switch to defection to secure higher payoffs.

4. **Reciprocity Mechanism:**
   - Punish defectors by switching to defection if a significant number of players defected in the previous round.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds), gradually increase defection to maximize immediate gains, as future rounds are limited.

6. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Adjust cooperation/defection based on the stock's trend, switching strategies if the stock depletes too quickly due to others' defection.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
Initialize:
    cooperate_first_round = True
    stock_history = []
    last_actions = []

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round or cooperate_first_round:
        choose action C
        cooperate_first_round = False
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        previous_stock = stock_history[-1] if stock_history else current_stock

        # Determine if stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable
        trend = determine_trend(current_stock, previous_stock)

        # Check thresholds relative to capacity
        if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity and trend == 'increasing':
            action = C
        elif 0.5 * capacity <= current_stock < 0.75 * capacity:
            if trend == 'stable' or 'slightly_decreasing':
                action = C
            else:
                # Consider switching based on number of defectors
                num_defectors = count_defectors(last_actions)
                if num_defectors > n/2:
                    action = D
                else:
                    action = C
        elif current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            action = D

        # Endgame strategy for last few rounds
        if round_number in last_rounds:
            action = D

    record action and update stock_history
    update last_actions with current actions of all players
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a cooperative tone, encouraging others to follow suit.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Uses thresholds to decide when to switch strategies based on resource sustainability.
- **Reciprocity:** Adjusts behavior in response to others' actions, deterring excessive defection.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Maximizes immediate gains when future rounds are limited.

This strategy is adaptive, considering both the state of the resource and players' behaviors, aiming for a balance between cooperation and self-interest.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_9 = '''
To maintain cooperation and prevent resource depletion, the strategy is designed as follows:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round.
2. **Punishment for Defection**: If in the previous round, total consumption exceeded half of the available stock, defect this round as punishment.
3. **Recovery Check**: After defecting once, check if the new stock after growth is above 50% of capacity:
   - If yes, return to cooperation next round.
   - If no, continue defecting.

This strategy balances punishing defection with opportunities for recovery, encouraging cooperation while preventing resource depletion.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate unless others defected previously; if they did, defect once then reconsider.}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_10 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Stock Sustainability (ARSS)**

The ARSS strategy is designed to balance individual payoffs with collective sustainability by adaptively responding to the stock level and opponents' behavior. It integrates reciprocity, stock monitoring, and forward-looking considerations.

### 1. Decision Rules:

- **First Round Cooperation:** Cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline.
  
- **Reciprocal Response:** In subsequent rounds:
  - **Cooperate** if at least 80% of players cooperated in the previous round.
  - **Defect** if fewer than 50% cooperated, signaling disapproval of exploitation.

- **Stock-Level Adaptation:**
  - If stock is below 25% of capacity, Cooperate to allow recovery.
  - If stock is between 25% and 75%, defect only if others defected in the previous round.
  - If stock exceeds 75%, Cooperate to maintain sustainability.

- **Future Stock Consideration:** Scale cooperation based on remaining rounds. For each remaining round, reduce defection likelihood by 5%.

### 2. Edge Cases Handling:

- **Last Round Caution:** In the final two rounds, Cooperate to prevent stock depletion.
  
- **Low Stock Recovery:** If stock drops below 20%, prioritize Cooperation for recovery.

### 3. Collective Alignment:

The strategy promotes collective sustainability by encouraging cooperation unless exploitation is detected. It adapts to maintain resource health while considering future interactions, ensuring fair distribution of benefits across all rounds.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function decide_action(previous_actions, stock_level, capacity, remaining_rounds):
    if first round:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        previous_cooperation = count of C in previous_actions
        cooperation_rate = previous_cooperation / n
        
        if cooperation_rate >= 0.8:
            return Cooperate
        elif cooperation_rate < 0.5:
            return Defect
        else:
            if stock_level < 0.25 * capacity:
                return Cooperate
            elif 0.25 <= stock_level/capacity <= 0.75:
                if previous_defection > 0:
                    return Defect with probability scaled by future rounds
                else:
                    return Cooperate
            else:
                return Cooperate

    if action == C:
        return stock_level / (2n)

# Update strategy based on observed actions and stock dynamics
```

This strategy aims to foster cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation, ensuring a sustainable balance for all players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_11 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining the common resource effectively, we can adopt a dynamic strategy that balances cooperation with necessary adjustments based on observed outcomes. This approach ensures sustainability while discouraging excessive exploitation.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and resource conservation.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each round, observe the stock level after growth. This helps determine whether the current level of cooperation is sufficient or if adjustments are needed.

3. **Adjust Based on Trends**:
   - If the stock remains stable or increases, continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock decreases despite cooperation (indicating too many Defectors), switch to Defecting in the next round as a form of punishment.

4. **Revert When Recovered**: After defecting once or twice, revert back to Cooperating if the stock shows signs of recovery. This encourages others to return to cooperative behavior while maintaining resource sustainability.

### Summary:
- **First Round**: Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If stock is stable or increasing → Continue Cooperating.
  - If stock decreases → Defect once, then revert to Cooperating if the stock recovers.

This strategy aims to maintain high stock levels by rewarding cooperation and penalizing exploitation through temporary defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_12 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Always Cooperate in the first round to establish trust and observe others' behavior.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If more than 50% of players cooperated last round, continue Cooperating.
   - **Defection Trigger:** If 50% or fewer cooperated, switch to Defecting in the next round.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - Define a critical stock level as 1.5 times the number of players (1.5n).
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, Cooperate to allow regeneration.
   - If the stock is above the threshold, follow the majority action from the previous round.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds, prioritize personal gain by Defecting if beneficial.
   - Ensure that in the very last round, Defecting is chosen to maximize immediate payoff without future consequences.

This strategy promotes sustainability while adapting to others' actions and protecting against stock depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_13 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance individual payoffs with sustainable resource management through adaptive cooperation and defection. It uses observable history and current state to guide decisions, promoting a collective mindset while being robust against various opponent behaviors.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish trust and maintain a healthy stock level.
   
2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Stock Level Check:** If the current stock is above 70% of capacity, continue cooperating.
     - This threshold indicates sustainable use; cooperation maintains future payoffs.
   - **Defection Threshold:** If the stock drops below 50% of capacity or if more than half of the players defected in the previous round, switch to Defect (D).
     - Defecting helps protect individual payoff when others are over-consuming.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Shift towards maximizing immediate gain by defecting.
   - As there are no future consequences beyond the current round, prioritize higher payoffs.

### Handling Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to initiate sustainable stock use.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize personal payoff without affecting future rounds.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If stock is critically low (below 30% of capacity), defect to ensure some consumption before depletion.

### Adaptive Mechanism:

- **Reciprocity Check:** Monitor the number of defections in recent rounds. Cooperate if a majority of players cooperated previously; otherwise, defect.
- **Stock Trend Analysis:** Use a moving average of stock levels over past rounds to assess sustainability trends, adjusting strategy accordingly.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```
Initialize:
    cooperation_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    defection_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    recent_defections = []

For each round from 1 to r:

    record action and outcomes
    update recent_defections with current actions

Return total payoff
```

This strategy aims to maintain a balance between cooperation and self-interest, ensuring long-term sustainability while adapting to the actions of others. It encourages collective responsibility early on and shifts focus to individual gain as the game concludes.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy, named "Adaptive Reciprocity," balances cooperation and punishment to maintain a sustainable common pool resource. It encourages cooperation while adapting to others' behaviors.

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to initiate trust and maximize initial stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If the stock level is above 75% of capacity and at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating.
   - **Punishment Mechanism:** If the cooperation rate drops below half or the stock falls below 75%, defect (D) once as a punishment to deter overexploitation.
   - **Forgiveness Clause:** After defecting, return to cooperation if others show increased cooperation in subsequent rounds.

3. **Final Round Strategy:**
   - Cooperate if the overall cooperation rate across all previous rounds was high (above 50%). Otherwise, defect to maximize individual payoff given the last chance.

This strategy integrates elements of reciprocity and forgiveness, promoting long-term sustainability while adapting to dynamic conditions. Each player independently assesses collective behavior and stock health to decide actions, fostering a balance between individual gain and communal resource preservation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_15 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual gain with collective sustainability in a dynamic game setting, we propose a strategic approach that combines cooperation with adaptive responses based on environmental cues. This strategy is designed to be self-enforcing and responsive to both stock levels and the actions of other players.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Based Triggers

1. **Initialization**:
   - **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C). Start by cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and resource conservation.

2. **Parameters**:
   - Set a **Stock Threshold (T)** at 75% of the capacity. This indicates a healthy stock level.
   - Define a **Defection Threshold (H)** as half the number of players, rounded up. This represents a significant proportion of defectors.

3. **Post-Round Evaluation**:
   - After each round, evaluate two key metrics:
     1. The current stock level (**S_t**).
     2. The number of players who defected in the previous round (**D_{t-1}**).

4. **Decision Logic for Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If both conditions are met:
     - Stock Level > T
     - Number of Defectors < H
     Then, continue Cooperating (C).
   - If either condition is violated:
     - Stock Level ≤ T OR Number of Defectors ≥ H
     Then, switch to Defecting (D) for the next round.

5. **Reversion to Cooperation**:
   - After switching to Defection, continuously monitor the stock level and defection rates.
   - If in a subsequent round, both conditions are met again (Stock Level > T AND Defectors < H), revert to Cooperating (C).

6. **Endgame Consideration**:
   - In the penultimate round, if possible, consider defecting to maximize final payoff without future repercussions.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, we set a positive tone and allow the stock to remain robust.
- **Stock Threshold (T)**: Monitoring the stock level ensures that resource depletion is checked, preventing a tragedy of the commons.
- **Defection Threshold (H)**: This measure deters excessive defection by responding when a significant number of players defect, maintaining social cohesion.
- **Adaptive Switching**: The strategy is flexible, allowing reversion to cooperation once conditions improve, thus rewarding positive collective behavior.

This approach incentivizes sustainable resource use while providing mechanisms to adapt to changing dynamics and prevent overexploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_16 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate to establish a cooperative foundation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Stock Levels**: Track the stock level after each round.
   - **Threshold Check**: Define a threshold, e.g., 50% of capacity.
     - If stock is above this threshold, continue cooperating.
     - If stock drops below, defect for a set number of rounds (e.g., 2-3) as punishment.
   - **Post-Punishment Phase**: After defecting, revert to cooperation if the stock shows signs of recovery (e.g., increasing trend).

**Edge Cases Handling**:
- **Last Round**: Maintain cooperation unless the stock is critically low, as future punishment isn't feasible but cooperation might still be reciprocated.

This strategy encourages sustained cooperation by punishing defectors and allowing for recovery, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_17 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual payoffs with collective resource sustainability in a repeated public goods game, we propose a threshold-based strategy that adapts to the current state of the shared resource. This approach ensures that each player contributes to maintaining the resource while also securing personal benefits when necessary.

### Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

**Objective:**  
Maintain the stock of the resource above a sustainable level by cooperating, while switching to defection when the stock falls below a critical threshold to secure immediate payoffs.

**Mechanism:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**  
   Cooperate in the first round to start with maximum contribution to the resource.

2. **Threshold Check:**  
   After each round, evaluate the current stock level (S_t) relative to the capacity (C). Define a threshold at 50% of the capacity:
   - **Upper Threshold:** If S_t > 0.5 * C, continue cooperating.
   - **Lower Threshold:** If S_t ≤ 0.5 * C, switch to defecting.

3. **Recovery Mechanism:**  
   After defecting for one round, reassess the stock level:
   - If S_t has increased above the lower threshold due to others' cooperation, revert to cooperating.
   - If S_t remains below the threshold, continue defecting until recovery is observed.

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation Above Threshold:** By maintaining the stock above 50% capacity, players ensure a sustainable resource for future rounds, maximizing long-term payoffs.
- **Defection Below Threshold:** When the stock drops significantly, defecting allows players to secure higher immediate payoffs before potential depletion, while also signaling the need for others to cooperate more in subsequent rounds.

**Implementation:**

Each player independently follows these rules without communication. This strategy is robust as it adapts based on observable resource levels, promoting both individual and collective benefits.

### Conclusion

The **Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)** strategy provides a balanced approach between contributing to the public good and securing personal gains when the resource is at risk. By setting a clear threshold and incorporating a recovery mechanism, players can sustain the resource effectively while adapting their behavior based on its condition.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_18 = '''
**Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first round, all players cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and maintains the stock at maximum capacity.

2. **Monitor Past Actions**:
   - Track the number of defections in the previous rounds. Calculate the percentage of players who defected.

3. **Threshold-Based Response**:
   - If the percentage of defectors exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 20%), switch strategy to defect (D) in the next round. This punishes defectors and discourages exploitation.
   - If defections are below the threshold, continue cooperating to sustain the stock.

4. **Stock Level Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitor the current stock level. If it falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to cooperation for the next few rounds to allow replenishment.
   - Use a rule like: if stock is below 50%, prioritize cooperation to rebuild.

5. **Reciprocal Approach**:
   - Implement a reciprocal strategy where the percentage of defections in the current round mirrors past behavior. For example, if x% defected last round, y% defect this round.
   - Balance this with maintaining sustainable stock levels to avoid depletion.

6. **Adaptation in Later Rounds**:
   - In later rounds, especially as the game nears its end, adjust strategies to maintain stock health while considering the reduced future consequences of current actions.

7. **Robustness Against Various Behaviors**:
   - Ensure the strategy is resilient against different opponent behaviors without relying on coordination, using only observable history and state.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while ensuring resource sustainability through adaptive cooperation andpunishment mechanisms.

### Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Initial Rounds (First Round):** Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and maximize initial stock sustainability.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If the stock level is above 90% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
  - If the stock drops below 90%, switch to Defecting for up to two rounds to protect individual payoff while signaling the need for cooperation.
  - After defecting, monitor if the stock recovers. If it does, revert to Cooperate; otherwise, continue Defecting.
- **Final Rounds (Last Round):** Cooperate to encourage a cooperative endgame and sustain stock levels.

#### 2. Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a positive tone and maintain the maximum stock level.
- **Last Round:** Maintain cooperation unless the stock is critically low, in which case Defect only if necessary for immediate payoff without harming future sustainability (though there are no future rounds).

#### 3. Collective Alignment:
The strategy promotes collective sustainability by rewarding cooperation and penalizing defection through temporary retaliation, aiming to balance individual gain with resource preservation.

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, history):
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return 'C'
    
    stock_threshold = 0.9 * capacity
    
    if current_stock >= stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        recent_actions = [action for action in history[-2:]]
        if 'D' in recent_actions:
            consecutive_defects = sum(1 for a in recent_actions if a == 'D')
            if consecutive_defects <= 2:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

    # For the last round, adjust based on stock level
    if len(history) == r - 1:
        if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

This strategy encourages cooperation while adaptively responding to defections, aiming to maintain a sustainable balance for all players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_20 = '''
To effectively manage the common pool resource across multiple rounds while balancing immediate gains and future sustainability, we can adopt a straightforward strategy based on observed stock levels:

1. **First Round:** Always Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and maintain or increase the stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1):** 
   - If the stock after regrowth in the previous round is at least 75% of capacity, continue to Cooperate.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to Defecting to secure higher payoffs while the stock is still sufficient.

3. **Final Round (Round r):** Always Defect to maximize your payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

This strategy ensures early conservation and allows for exploitation when necessary or in the final round.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_21 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Initial Rounds:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation and maintain the stock level.

**2. Middle Rounds:**
- **Cooperation Monitoring:** Track the number of players who cooperated in previous rounds.
  - If the cooperation rate is above 50%, continue cooperating.
  - If below, switch to Defect (D) for one round as a punishment mechanism.
  
- **Sustainability Check:** Ensure stock levels remain above a threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity). If below, temporarily cooperate to allow recovery.

**3. Final Rounds:**
- In the last round or when only one round remains, switch to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without future repercussions.

**4. Adaptive Thresholds:**
- Use dynamic thresholds based on remaining rounds and stock levels. Adjust leniency towards cooperation as rounds progress to maintain sustainability.

**5. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **All Players Defect:** If others consistently defect, defect after attempts to encourage cooperation.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate if stock is near zero to facilitate recovery.

This strategy balances cooperation and punishment, adapting based on group behavior and stock dynamics, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies.

To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance cooperation to sustain resource levels with the temptation to defect for immediate gains. The strategy should adapt based on current conditions and past actions while handling edge cases like the first and last rounds effectively.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to maximize initial growth.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold:** If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, cooperate.
   - **Defection Tolerance:** If the percentage of players who defected in the previous round is below 30%, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect as retaliation.
3. **Last Round:** Treat it like any other round to maintain consistency.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a high stock level for maximum growth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - After each round, assess:
     - **Stock Level:** If above 75% of capacity, continue cooperating.
     - **Defection Rate:** Calculate the percentage of players who defected in the previous round. If below 30%, cooperate; else, defect to retaliate and deter future defections.

3. **Retaliation Mechanism:**
   - Use a trigger strategy where cooperation continues until a significant number (e.g., more than 30%) defect, prompting a switch to defection for a round as punishment.

4. **Last Round Handling:**
   - Apply the same decision rules as other rounds to maintain consistency and avoid sudden strategic shifts that could be exploited.

### Conclusion:

This strategy encourages sustained cooperation when beneficial while adapting to others' actions to prevent overexploitation, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term resource sustainability.

To maintain the sustainability of the common resource while balancing individual incentives, an effective strategy involves conditioning cooperation based on the current stock level. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to start with a high stock level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the previous round's stock level is above 75% of the capacity, continue to cooperate.
   - If it falls below this threshold, switch to defecting until the stock recovers.

This strategy encourages maintaining a healthy stock level by cooperating when it's sustainable and defecting only when necessary to avoid exploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_24 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Strategy Overview:**
The strategy is designed to promote sustainable cooperation while adapting to the actions of other players and the current stock level. It combines elements of reciprocal behavior with conservation measures to maintain the stock's health.

**2. Decision Rules:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, all players cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes initial payoffs without depleting the stock.

- **Reciprocal Behavior:** After the first round, each player's action depends on the majority of other players' actions in the previous round. If the majority cooperated, the player cooperates; otherwise, they defect. This is inspired by a Tit-for-Tat approach but scaled for multiple players.

- **Stock Conservation Threshold:** Implement a stock threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity). If the stock falls below this threshold, all players switch to cooperation temporarily in the next round to allow replenishment, regardless of previous actions. This ensures the resource doesn't deplete beyond recovery.

**3. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** All players cooperate.
- **Last Round:** Players follow the same strategy as other rounds; there's no special treatment since the focus is on maintaining cooperation throughout.
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock reaches zero, all players cooperate in subsequent rounds to rebuild the resource.

**4. Adaptive Mechanism:**

- **Majority Rule:** Each player assesses the previous round's cooperation rate. Cooperation continues if a majority (or predefined percentage) cooperated; otherwise, they defect.
- **Stock-Based Adjustment:** If the stock is below the threshold, players cooperate to conserve, regardless of others' actions.

**5. Robustness and Collective Mindset:**

The strategy encourages cooperation by rewarding it with sustainable payoffs while punishing defection through reciprocal actions. It adapts to both the group's behavior and environmental (stock) conditions, ensuring resilience against exploitation and resource depletion.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, fostering a collective mindset where players act in the shared interest of maintaining a healthy stock for continued benefits.

**Collective Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

The Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP) strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability in the Common Pool Resource Game. It encourages cooperation while adapting to opponents' behaviors and ensuring resource sustainability.

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate (C) in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline.
- **Ongoing Rounds**:
  - Calculate the number of defectors from the previous round.
  - If the proportion of defectors exceeds 50%, retaliate by defecting (D) in the next round(s).
  - If cooperation levels are sufficient, continue cooperating (C).
  - Monitor stock level; if it falls below a sustainability threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to defecting (D) to secure remaining resources.
- **Final Rounds**: In the last few rounds, if the stock is above the sustainability threshold, defect (D) to maximize final payoffs.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Start with cooperation to set a positive tone.
- **Last Round**: If the stock is healthy, defect to secure maximum payoff without future consequences.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Prioritize defecting if the stock is critically low to prevent further depletion and secure immediate gains.

### 3. Collective Alignment:
- Promotes a mindset of mutual cooperation, with mechanisms to punish defection to maintain resource sustainability.
- Encourages others to cooperate by demonstrating retaliation against excessive defection, creating an incentive for return to cooperative behavior.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_punishment(n, r, capacity, stock):
    # Initialize variables
    previous_defectors = 0
    current_strategy = 'C'
    
    for round in range(1, r+1):
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:

```

### Strategy Overview:
The ACP strategy begins with cooperation to foster mutual benefit. It adaptively switches to defection upon detecting significant non-cooperation, ensuring players do not exploit others' goodwill. By monitoring the stock and adjusting actions accordingly, it maintains resource sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs in critical situations like low stock levels or final rounds. This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors, promoting cooperation yet being resilient to exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_26 = '''
To address the strategic challenges of the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive and robust collective strategy that balances cooperation with the need to prevent exploitation. The strategy dynamically adjusts based on observed behavior and environmental conditions, ensuring long-term sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Cooperation Threshold (CT):** A threshold determining when sufficient players have cooperated in the previous round.
- **Stock Threshold (ST):** A stock level below which cooperation is prioritized to conserve resources.
- **Rounds Remaining:** Adjust strategy as the game progresses, especially nearing the end.

**Decision Logic:**
1. **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a cooperative tone and observe others' reactions.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If it's the last round, Defect (D) to maximize immediate gain.
   - Calculate the number of players who Defected in the previous round.
   - If the number of Defectors exceeds CT, switch to Defecting to avoid exploitation.
   - If the current stock is below ST, Cooperate (C) to conserve and allow growth.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate if the previous round's cooperation was above CT; else, Defect.

**3. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Initiate with Cooperation to foster mutual benefit.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff without future consequences.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize conservation by Cooperating when stock is below ST.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_cooperation(n, capacity, r, history):
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return 'C'
    
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    remaining_rounds = r - len(history)
    
    if remaining_rounds == 1:  # Last round
        return 'D'
    
    last_actions = history[-1]
    defectors_last_round = sum(1 for action in last_actions if action == 'D')
    cooperation_threshold = n * 0.5  # Adjust based on game dynamics
    
    if defectors_last_round > cooperation_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    if current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    
    # Default to cooperation if conditions not met
    return 'C'
```

### Strategy Explanation:

- **Adaptation:** The strategy adjusts based on the number of Defectors and the current stock level, promoting flexibility.
- **Robustness:** By punishing excessive defection and conserving when necessary, it withstands various opponent strategies.
- **Collective Alignment:** Encourages cooperation to maintain resource sustainability for mutual benefit without assuming others' strategies.

This approach ensures that players act in their self-interest while contributing to the preservation of the common pool, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_27 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
To maintain the stock near its maximum sustainable level (capacity) through adaptive cooperation and punishment mechanisms, ensuring long-term sustainability without depleting resources.

**Strategy Components:**

1. **Initial Round:**  
   - All players Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and maximize initial stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**  
   Each player independently decides their action based on the current stock level and previous round's cooperation rate using the following rules:

   - **Current Stock Level (S):** The stock before any consumption in the current round.
   - **Defector Count (D_count):** Number of players who defected in the previous round.

3. **Decision Rules:**  
   a. **High Stock Level (>75% of Capacity):**  
      - Cooperate if fewer than 20% of players defected last round.
      - Defect once as punishment if more than 20% defected, then return to cooperation.
   
   b. **Moderate Stock Level (50-75% of Capacity):**  
      - Defect if more than 20% defected last round and stock decreased significantly (e.g., >10% drop).
      - Otherwise, Cooperate to maintain the stock.

   c. **Low Stock Level (<25% of Capacity):**  
      - Cooperate to allow stock recovery and prevent depletion.

4. **Punishment Mechanism:**  
   - If players defect beyond a threshold (20%), others retaliate by defecting for up to two rounds.
   - After punishment, revert to cooperation if the stock shows signs of recovery or cooperation increases.

5. **Forgiveness:**  
   - After punishing defectors, return to cooperation once conditions improve, ensuring sustainability without perpetual retaliation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
def strategy(n, capacity, history):
    current_stock = history[-1].stock if history else capacity
    if not history:
        return 'C'
    
    d_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1].actions if action == 'D')
    s = current_stock
    
    if s > 0.75 * capacity and d_count <= 0.2 * n:
        return 'C'
    elif (s >= 0.5 * capacity and s <= 0.75 * capacity) or (s < 0.25 * capacity):
        # Defect as punishment for up to next two rounds
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

```

**Explanation:**  
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to maximize sustainability.
- **Adaptive Punishment:** Defects when stock levels or past actions indicate exploitation, preventing resource depletion.
- **Forgiveness:** Returns to cooperation after punishment, allowing recovery and maintaining trust.

This strategy balances individual rationality with collective sustainability, ensuring the common pool resource is managed effectively over multiple rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_28 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - All players start by Cooperating (C). This establishes a baseline of trust and maximizes the initial stock level.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels:**
   - After each round, observe the current stock level relative to the capacity.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - **If the stock is above 90% of capacity:** Continue Cooperating (C). This indicates high levels of cooperation among players.
   - **If the stock drops below 90% of capacity:** Switch to Defecting (D) in the next round as a form of punishment. This encourages other players to revert to cooperation.

4. **Recovery Mechanism:**
   - If, after defecting, the stock begins to recover and exceeds 90% of capacity again, revert to Cooperating (C). This allows the stock to sustainably replenish.

5. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - In the final round, if the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity), players may choose to Defect (D) to maximize their immediate payoff without long-term consequences. If the stock is below this threshold, continue Cooperating (C) to preserve the remaining stock.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
def collective_strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Determine if recent actions led to stock depletion
    previous_stock = history[-1]["stock"]
    if current_stock / capacity > 0.9:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"
    
    # For last round adjustment
    if current_round == r:
        if current_stock / capacity > 0.8:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

```

**Rationale:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages a cooperative start, maintaining high stock levels.
- **Stock-Based Adaptation:** Responsive to the collective actions of all players, promoting sustainability and punishing defection.
- **Recovery Focus:** Allows for stock replenishment after periods of defection, ensuring long-term playability.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Balances immediate gain with stock preservation in the final round.

This strategy promotes a balance between cooperation and self-interest, adapting dynamically to maintain resource sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while maintaining a sustainable common pool resource through adaptive behavior.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Establish a cooperative baseline to maintain stock levels and encourage mutual cooperation from the start.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Observation:** Calculate the total consumption from the previous round.
   - **Condition Check:**
     - If the previous round's total consumption exceeded the expected level under full cooperation (S_prev / 2) AND the current stock after growth is at least half of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect (D)
         - Rationale: Punish defectors to deter future exploitation while ensuring the stock remains sustainable.
     - Else:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
         - Rationale: Continue cooperation if others are not exploiting or if the stock needs replenishment.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff since there is no future round to preserve the stock for, leading to a tragedy of the commons scenario.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Stock Depletion Concerns:** The strategy prioritizes cooperation if the stock is below half capacity, ensuring resource sustainability.
- **Adaptive Punishment:** Defection occurs only when others have exploited and the stock can sustain it, preventing unnecessary harm to future rounds.
- **No Communication Needed:** Players rely on observable game state and history rather than signaling.

**Collective Mindset:**

- Encourages cooperation as a default but adapts to prevent exploitation.
- Balances individual gain with collective sustainability through conditional punishment.
- Aligns actions with the group's long-term benefit, fostering a stable resource environment.

This strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors and ensures each player contributes to maintaining the common pool while protecting their interests.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose the following adaptive collective strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoffs while maintaining stock sustainability through cooperative and adaptive decision-making.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** Initiate cooperation to establish a high starting stock level, encouraging others to follow suit and preserving the resource for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Level:** Continuously assess the current stock against a dynamically adjusted threshold based on game parameters.
   - **Threshold Calculation:** Set the threshold at 50% of capacity (threshold = capacity / 2). This serves as a balance between sustainability and resource utilization.
   
3. **Adaptive Threshold Response:**
   - **If Stock ≥ Threshold:** Continue cooperating to maintain stock levels, encouraging sustainability and future payoffs.
   - **If Stock < Threshold:** Switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains, as the stock is deemed insufficient for long-term sustainability.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - **Last Two Rounds:** Shift strategy to always defect, prioritizing immediate payoffs since there's no future benefit to preserving the stock beyond these rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Initial Stock (Full Capacity):** Cooperate in the first round to maintain high stock levels.
- **Depleted Stock (0):** Defect immediately as cooperation yields no benefit when the stock is already depleted.
- **Low Stock Near End:** Aggressively defect in final rounds to maximize payoffs before game conclusion.

### Strategy Logic Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, current_round):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        threshold = capacity / 2
        if current_stock >= threshold and current_round < r - 1:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages high stock levels, setting a positive precedent.
- **Threshold Monitoring:** Dynamically adjusts strategy based on resource sustainability, ensuring cooperation when beneficial.
- **Endgame Defection:** Maximizes immediate gains when future payoffs are no longer possible.

This strategy balances cooperation and self-interest, adapting to the game's state to optimize individual payoffs while considering collective outcomes.

description_COLLECTIVE_31 = '''
To address the problem, we can use a straightforward strategy based on monitoring the stock level after each round's growth. The key idea is to cooperate as long as the stock remains above a certain threshold and switch to defecting once it drops below that threshold. This approach helps maintain the resource when it's plentiful while allowing individuals to maximize their gains before it depletes too much.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Set a Threshold:** Determine a specific stock level as a threshold, such as half of the initial capacity (e.g., 50 for a capacity of 100).

2. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating since the initial stock is at maximum capacity.

3. **Monitor Stock Levels:** After each round, observe the new stock level after growth.

4. **Adjust Strategy:**
   - If the stock level remains above the threshold, continue Cooperating.
   - If it drops below the threshold, switch to Defecting in subsequent rounds.

5. **Continuous Monitoring:** Repeat the monitoring and adjustment process for each round until the game concludes.

This strategy balances resource sustainability with individual gain optimization, adapting behavior based on the current state of the stock.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative tone and maximize initial collective payoff.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     - If the current stock level is above 50% of capacity AND fewer than half the players defected in the previous round, cooperate (C).
     - Otherwise, defect (D) to protect individual payoffs when cooperation isn't sustainable.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to initiate a cooperative environment.
   - **Last Round**: Always defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

3. **Collective Alignment**:
   - The strategy encourages cooperation when the stock is healthy and most players have cooperated previously, promoting sustainability and collective benefit.
   - It adapts to defection when necessary, ensuring individual payoffs aren't unduly sacrificed.

This strategy balances sustainability with self-interest, adapting based on both the game's state and historical actions to maintain robustness against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_33 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances individual payoffs with long-term sustainability. The strategy is based on observing past actions and current stock levels to make informed decisions.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round:**
   - All players cooperate (C) to initialize a healthy stock level and set a cooperative tone for subsequent rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** Players will continue to cooperate if the average cooperation rate from previous rounds is above 60% AND the current stock level exceeds 50% of capacity.
   - **Defection Trigger:** If either condition is not met, players switch to defecting (D) to protect their individual payoffs and prevent resource depletion.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - In the final round, if the stock remains healthy, players continue cooperating to maximize total payoffs; otherwise, they defect.
   - The strategy dynamically adjusts based on observed behavior and stock health without requiring special handling for most rounds beyond the first.

### Decision Rules:

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C).
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - Calculate average past cooperation rate.
  - Assess current stock level relative to capacity.
  - Cooperate if both conditions are met; otherwise, defect.

This strategy encourages sustained cooperation while allowing strategic defection when necessary, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective resource management.

To address the challenge of designing a robust collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with a mechanism to prevent stock depletion while allowing recovery. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Thresholds (ACST)

1. **First Round Action:**
   - All players Cooperate (C) in the first round to maximize initial sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Health Check:** At the start of each round, evaluate the current stock level.
     - If the stock is above a sustainable threshold (e.g., 66% of capacity), continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting (D) for that round.

3. **Post-Defection Recovery:**
   - After defecting, monitor the stock over subsequent rounds. Once the stock recovers above the threshold, revert to Cooperating.

4. **Last Round Consideration:**
   - In the final round, players may choose to Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Players continuously assess the stock's health and adjust their actions accordingly, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

This strategy encourages cooperation when the resource is healthy while allowing strategic defection to prevent over-exploitation, promoting a resilient approach to resource management in repeated interactions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_35 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we've designed a strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maintain the stock while maximizing individual payoffs. The approach adapts based on others' actions and the current state of the stock.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)

1. **First Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C).
     - **Rationale**: Establish a baseline of trust to maintain the stock and encourage initial cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Monitor Previous Round**:
     - Calculate the number of players who defected.
     - Assess the current stock level.
   - **Decision Rules**:
     - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round OR if the current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity):
       - **Action**: Defect (D).
         - **Rationale**: Punish excessive defection and prevent further stock depletion.
     - Otherwise:
       - **Action**: Cooperate (C).
         - **Rationale**: Maintain cooperation when beneficial and allow stock replenishment.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**:
   - **Action**: Defect (D).
     - **Rationale**: Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_punishment(n, capacity, current_stock, history, round_num, total_rounds):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Determine number of defectors in previous round
    prev_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'D')
    
    # Check if stock is below critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity)
    stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity

print(action)  # Output: 'C'
```

### Strategy Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable stock level.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Each subsequent action depends on the previous round's outcomes. If too many players defected or the stock is critically low, the strategy defects to punish and protect the stock.
- **Stock Recovery**: By cooperating when the stock is above the threshold, the strategy allows for natural replenishment, ensuring future payoffs.
- **Endgame Maximization**: In the final round, defecting ensures the highest possible immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

This approach promotes a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability, adapting dynamically to maintain the resource for as long as possible while strategically maximizing payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_36 = '''
To maintain a sustainable balance between individual gain and collective resource management in a common-pool resource scenario, each player should adopt the following strategy:

1. **Cooperate** if the current stock level is above 50% of its capacity.
2. **Defect** if the stock level falls to 50% or below.

This threshold-based approach encourages cooperation when resources are plentiful and switches to defection when conservation is necessary, promoting long-term sustainability while allowing for individual gains when possible.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_37 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maintain sustainable stock levels and maximize long-term payoffs. The strategy is based on continuous monitoring of the stock level and past player actions.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate in the first round.
   - **Rationale:** Builds trust and maintains a high initial stock level, promoting future sustainability.

2. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - **Threshold:** Establish a threshold at 75% of capacity.
   - **Action:** If stock is above this threshold, continue cooperating; if below, defect to recover personal payoff while prompting stock recovery.

3. **Defection and Retaliation:**
   - **Monitor Defectors:** Track the number of players who defected in previous rounds.
   - **Retaliation Mechanism:** If a significant portion (e.g., more than 25%) of players defected recently, retaliate by defecting for one round to discourage exploitation.

4. **Forgiveness and Re-cooperation:**
   - **Revert Condition:** After retaliating, monitor if others return to cooperation. If they do, revert to cooperation to rebuild the stock.
   - **Sustained Cooperation Check:** Ensure that cooperation resumes only if a majority have switched back to cooperative actions.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - **Final Rounds Adjustment:** In the last few rounds, prioritize maximizing individual payoff while considering the need to sustain the stock for remaining rounds. This involves balancing immediate gains with future resource availability.

### Decision Rules:

- **Current Stock Level:** Cooperate if above 75% of capacity; defect if below.
- **Defection Response:** Defect for one round if a significant number of players defected previously, then revert based on others' subsequent actions.

This strategy aims to adapt dynamically to game conditions, ensuring resource sustainability while protecting against exploitation. It encourages cooperation as the default but includes mechanisms to address defection, promoting a balance that maximizes collective and individual payoffs over the game's duration.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and maximize initial stock regeneration.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - If the current stock level is above 50% of the capacity, cooperate (C).
     - If the stock level is below or equal to 50%, defect (D).
     - Additionally, if more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round to punish recent defections.
   - **Last Round:** Always defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - In the first round, cooperate to encourage initial stock sustainability.
   - In rounds where the stock is critically low (e.g., near zero), consider defecting to secure any remaining resources.
   - If all players defected in the previous round, continue defecting until the stock begins to recover above 50%.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   The strategy encourages cooperation when the stock is healthy and switches to defection when necessary, balancing individual gain with collective sustainability. It punishes recent defections to deter non-cooperative behavior without excessively harming the stock.

This adaptive approach aims to maintain high payoffs by balancing current consumption with future stock regeneration, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_39 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and punishment while considering the game's state. The strategy is designed to maintain sustainable stock levels, encouraging cooperation while being robust against defection.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline and maintain the stock at a sustainable level.

2. **Reciprocal Punishment**: In subsequent rounds, each player cooperates if at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, they defect. This mimics a Tit-for-Tat approach, encouraging cooperation by retaliating against defection.

3. **Stock-Level Consideration**: If the current stock level falls below 50% of the capacity, all players switch to cooperating regardless of previous actions. This helps replenish the stock and prevent depletion.

4. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After sustained cooperation from previously defecting players (e.g., three consecutive cooperative actions), players forgive past defections, allowing for renewed cooperation.

5. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last few rounds (e.g., final 10% of total rounds), players increase their propensity to cooperate by a fixed percentage (e.g., 20%) to avoid end-game depletion, balancing immediate gains with collective sustainability.

### Decision Rules:

- **Cooperate** if:
  - It is the first round.
  - At least half of the players cooperated in the previous round, and the stock is above the threshold.
  - The stock level is below 50% of capacity to aid recovery.
  
- **Defect** if:
  - Less than half of the players cooperated in the previous round, and the stock is above the threshold.

### Edge Cases:

- **First Round**: Cooperate to establish trust and maintain initial stock levels.
- **Last Few Rounds**: Adjust behavior to avoid depletion by increasing cooperation propensity.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Prioritize cooperation to facilitate recovery, regardless of past actions.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive, forgiving, and robust against various opponent behaviors, ensuring the sustainability of the common pool resource while maximizing individual payoffs over multiple rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_40 = '''
### Strategy: Adaptive Sustainability Cooperation (ASC)

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation sets a baseline of trust and observes other players' responses.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Calculate the average stock level over the past few rounds to determine sustainability trends.
  - If the stock is above 70% of capacity and fewer than half the players defected last round, Cooperate (C).
  - If the stock drops below 50% or more than half defected, switch to Defecting (D) to protect your payoff.

**2. Edge Cases:**

- **Last Round:** Defect (D) as future consequences don't matter; maximize immediate gain.
- **Low Stock:** When stock is critically low (e.g., below 30% of capacity), prioritize short-term gains by Defecting, as sustainability isn't feasible.

**3. Collective Alignment:**

The strategy promotes collective good by initially cooperating and only defecting when necessary, encouraging others to maintain cooperation without being exploited. It's robust against various behaviors and adapts dynamically based on observed actions and stock levels.

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def ASC_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, history):
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'  # First round: Cooperate
    else:
        past_actions = [action for action in history[-1]]
        defectors = sum(1 for a in past_actions if a == 'D')
        
        avg_stock_last_rounds = average of recent stock levels
        
        if current_stock > 0.7 * capacity and defectors < n / 2:
            return 'C'
        elif current_stock <= 0.5 * capacity or defectors >= n / 2:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Consider additional factors like trend in stock levels
            if avg_stock_last_rounds is increasing or stable:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

    # Handle last round separately
    if current_round == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy balances cooperation with adaptive responses to maintain sustainability while protecting against exploitation, ensuring a robust approach in various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_41 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for each player, we need to balance between maximizing individual gain and maintaining the stock at a sustainable level. The key is to decide when to Cooperate (take less) and when to Defect (take more). After considering various scenarios and potential outcomes, the recommended strategy is:

**Strategy:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- For subsequent rounds:
   - If the previous round's ending stock was below half of the capacity (C/2), then Cooperate to help recover the stock.
   - Otherwise, Defect to maximize your gain.

This approach allows players to recover the stock when it's depleted and take advantage when it's sustainable.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_42 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** If the current stock level is above a dynamic threshold, calculated as \( \text{Threshold} = \frac{\text{Remaining Rounds}}{r} \times \text{Capacity} \). This means in earlier rounds with more remaining rounds, the threshold is higher, encouraging cooperation to maintain the stock for future gains.
   - **Defect (D):** If the current stock level is below this threshold. Additionally, always defect in the last round.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a strong initial stock level.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy encourages cooperation when it benefits the collective good by preserving the stock for higher future payoffs and switches to defection when short-term gains are more beneficial, especially as the game progresses towards its end.

This strategy is adaptive, balancing cooperation with strategic defection based on the current state and remaining rounds, ensuring robust performance against a variety of opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_43 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we have developed a robust approach that balances cooperation with necessary retaliation against excessive defection. This strategy is adaptive, considers both past actions and current stock levels, and handles edge cases thoughtfully.

### Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Stock Conservation

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone and maximizes collective payoff without immediate depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Count Previous Defections:** Observe the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - **Threshold Check:** If more than half of the players defected previously, defect (D) in the current round to punish and deter future exploitation.
   - **Stock Level Consideration:** If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, switch to defecting temporarily to conserve resources.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) if the stock is above 50% of capacity to encourage a sustainable end and maintain fairness.
   - Defect (D) if the stock is below this threshold to maximize immediate payoff without compromising future rounds, which no longer exist.

This strategy promotes cooperation while ensuring that excessive exploitation is met with retaliation, thus maintaining a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability. It adapts based on both social behavior and environmental state, fostering a robust approach suitable for various opponent behaviors in the tournament setting.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_44 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and stock dynamics. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining a sustainable common pool.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Monitoring

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C). 
  - Rationale: Starting with cooperation encourages initial stock stability and higher growth in subsequent rounds.

- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If the previous round's total consumption was sustainable (i.e., fewer than half of the players defected) and the current stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., capacity/2), continue cooperating.
  - Otherwise, defect (D) to protect your payoff if others are over-exploiting.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., capacity/4), switch to cooperation for the next few rounds to allow recovery.
- **Last Round:** Cooperate only if the stock is sufficiently high; otherwise, defect to maximize immediate gain without worrying about future growth.

**3. Collective Alignment:**

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by encouraging cooperation when mutually beneficial and adapting to prevent exploitation. Players independently decide their actions based on shared game parameters and observed history, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_cooperation(n, capacity, current_stock, previous_actions, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    defectors_last_round = sum(1 for action in previous_actions[-1] if action == 'D')
    stock_threshold = capacity / 2
    critical_stock_level = capacity / 4
    
    if current_stock < critical_stock_level:
        # Recover the stock by cooperating
        return 'C'
    
    if defectors_last_round <= n // 2 and current_stock > stock_threshold:
        # Cooperate as others are cooperating and stock is healthy
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Defect to protect payoff due to over-exploitation or low stock
        return 'D'

# Last round adjustment
if round_number == total_rounds:
    if current_stock > critical_stock_level:
        return 'D'  # Maximize immediate gain
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to maintain some stock
```

This strategy is designed to be adaptive, responding to both the actions of others and the health of the common pool. By balancing cooperation with strategic defection, it aims to sustain the resource while maximizing individual payoffs over the game's duration.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_45 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round of a game where the goal is to maximize individual payoff while considering the common resource (stock), we propose an adaptive strategy based on observations of stock levels. This approach balances maintaining cooperation with strategic defection when necessary.

### Strategy:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to start with a high stock level.
2. **Stock Level Monitoring**:
   - If the current stock falls below half of the capacity, defect to maximize immediate gain before further depletion.
   - If the stock decreases from the previous round (indicating potential overconsumption), switch to defecting in the next round.
   - Otherwise, continue cooperating.
3. **Endgame Defection**: Always defect in the last round since there are no future consequences.

### Explanation:
- The strategy begins with cooperation to maintain a high stock level initially.
- It monitors the stock level and switches to defection if the stock drops significantly or shows a decreasing trend, preventing further depletion.
- In the final round, defecting ensures maximum immediate gain without considering future rounds.

This approach adaptively balances cooperation and defection based on observed changes in the stock, aiming to optimize individual payoffs while being mindful of resource sustainability.

**Collective Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**

     - If fewer than 75% Cooperated, Defect in the current round.
   - Additionally, assess the current stock level relative to capacity:
     - If the stock is below 50% of capacity, switch to Cooperation to facilitate growth.

3. **Last Round Consideration:**

To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable resource (represented by the stock) in a repeated game scenario with multiple players, an effective strategy must balance cooperation and punishment. The goal is to encourage cooperative behavior while deterring excessive defection that could deplete the resource. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating in the first round.
2. **Monitor Defection Levels**: After each round, assess the number of players who defected.
3. **Punishment Mechanism**:
   - If the number of defections exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., more than half of the players), switch to defecting in the next round as a form of punishment.
4. **Forgiveness**: After punishing by defecting once, revert to cooperation if the stock begins to recover and cooperation levels improve.

### Detailed Strategy:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate unconditionally to establish initial trust and maximize resource growth.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the number of defections in the previous round.
   - If defections are below the threshold, continue cooperating.
   - If defections meet or exceed the threshold, defect in the next round as punishment.
3. **Post-Punishment Phase**: After defecting once, return to cooperation in the following rounds if the stock shows signs of recovery (e.g., stock level increases).
4. **Last Round Consideration**: Evaluate the current stock level. If it's sufficient to sustain another cooperative round without depletion, cooperate; otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

### Rationale:
- **Cooperation** is incentivized as it maintains or grows the resource, benefiting all players.
- **Punishment** deters excessive defection by imposing a cost on those who exploit cooperation.
- **Forgiveness** allows recovery of the resource and encourages players to return to cooperative behavior, preventing perpetual cycles of defection.

This strategy balances the need for cooperation with necessary deterrents against exploitation, promoting sustainability in the resource over repeated interactions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_48 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy in this scenario, we analyze the payoffs associated with Cooperating (C) and Defecting (D). Each player can choose either strategy, and their payoff depends on the choices of others. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Payoff Calculation**:
   - If a player chooses to Defect (D), they take \( \frac{S}{n} \), where \( S \) is the stock and \( n \) is the number of players.
   - If a player chooses to Cooperate (C), their payoff is \( \frac{S - k \cdot \frac{S}{n}}{2m} \), where \( k \) is the number of Defectors and \( m \) is the number of Cooperators.

2. **Dominant Strategy**:
   - Choosing D always yields a higher or equal payoff compared to C, regardless of others' choices.
   - If all players choose D, each gets \( \frac{S}{n} \).
   - If some choose C and others D, Defectors still receive a higher payoff without negatively affecting Cooperators.

### Conclusion:
In a one-shot game, the dominant strategy is to **Defect** because it ensures the highest possible payoff regardless of other players' actions.

   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning:** Start by cooperating to encourage mutual cooperation, maximizing initial payoffs and setting a positive tone for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Action Based on Previous Round's Defections:**
     - Count the number of players who defected in the previous round (D_prev).
     - If D_prev ≤ n/2, Cooperate.
     - If D_prev > n/2, Defect as punishment.
   - **Stock-Level Consideration:**
     - If the current stock level (S_t) is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate to allow recovery.
   - **Rationale:** Balance between punishing defectors and maintaining stock health for future payoffs.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect.
   - **Reasoning:** Since there are no future rounds, defecting maximizes immediate payoff without consequences in subsequent rounds.

### Summary:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to initiate mutual cooperation.
- **Middle Rounds:** Cooperate if fewer than half defected previously or if stock is low; otherwise, Defect.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize final payoff.

This strategy balances punishment with recovery and addresses the endgame problem effectively.

**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)**

1. **First Round Action**: Always Cooperate (C) to initiate with maximum stock regeneration and set a cooperative tone.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Threshold Check**: Calculate 70% of the game's capacity as the threshold.
     - If the current stock is above this threshold, choose to Cooperate (C).
     - If the current stock is below or equal to the threshold, choose to Defect (D).

3. **Last Round Action**: In the final round, defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

**Rationale**:
- The strategy starts cooperatively to encourage stock growth.
- It adapts based on stock levels, promoting conservation when necessary and allowing exploitation when sustainable.
- Defecting in the last round aligns with rational choice theory to maximize one's final payoff without concern for future repercussions.

This approach balances individual gain with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation while being responsive to the resource's state.

description_COLLECTIVE_51 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

The ACP strategy is designed to balance cooperation and punishment, adapting based on game state and opponent behavior. It aims to maintain a sustainable stock level while protecting against exploitation.

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate for the first few rounds to establish a high stock level.
- **Stock Level Monitoring**:
  - If stock is above 70% of capacity, continue cooperating.
  - If stock drops below 50%, switch to defecting until it recovers above 60%.
- **Opponent Behavior Adaptation**:
  - Track the number of defections by others. If more than half defected in recent rounds, defect for the next round as punishment.
- **Remaining Rounds Consideration**:
  - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%), increase defection rate to maximize current payoffs.

### 2. Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round**: Always cooperate to maintain a high initial stock.
- **Last Round**: Defect to secure maximum payoff as future growth doesn't matter.
- **All Others Defecting**: If all opponents defect, switch to defecting to avoid being exploited.

### 3. Collective Mindset:
The strategy prioritizes maintaining the resource's health while ensuring fairness by punishing frequent defections. It adapts dynamically to sustain long-term payoffs without assuming others' cooperation.

This approach ensures players contribute to the common good while protecting their interests against exploitation, promoting a balance between cooperation and self-interest.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players will Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes the chance of a sustainable stock level from the start.

2. **Reciprocity-Based Decision Making**: For subsequent rounds:
   - **Cooperation Threshold**: If at least 80% of players Cooperated in the previous round, continue to Cooperate.
   - **Defection Trigger**: If fewer than 50% Cooperated, switch to Defecting to protect individual payoffs.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring**:
   - **Low Stock Alert (30% of capacity)**: If stock falls below this threshold, all players Cooperate to allow regrowth.
   - **Stock Recovery (60% of capacity)**: Once above this level, players may resume their reciprocity strategy.

4. **Final Round Consideration**: In the last round, if stock is above 50%, defect to maximize individual gain since there are no future consequences.

5. **Adaptive Adjustment**: Continuously monitor the stock and opponents' actions. Adjust cooperation or defection to balance sustainability and personal benefit.

This strategy promotes collective sustainability while adapting to others' behaviors, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACST)**

**Objective:** Balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adaptively switching between cooperation and defection based on the common pool's stock level.

---

### 1. Decision Rules:

- **First Round (t=1):**
  - **Action:** Cooperate.
    - Rationale: Establish a high initial stock to set a positive precedent for future rounds.

- **Subsequent Rounds (2 ≤ t < r):**
  - **Monitor Stock Level:**
    - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, switch to defecting to prevent over-exploitation.
    - If the stock is above or equal to 50%, continue cooperating to maintain a healthy pool.

- **Last Round (t=r):**
  - **Evaluate Stock:**
    - Cooperate if the stock is above 50% of capacity to end on a cooperative note, preserving social capital.
    - Defect if the stock is below 50%, prioritizing personal gain in the final round.

### 2. Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to initiate with maximum cooperation.
- **Last Round:** Use stock level to decide action, ensuring a balance between collective and individual interests.
- **Significant Stock Depletion:** If stock drops below threshold mid-game, temporarily defect to signal the need for conservation.

### 3. Collective Alignment:

The strategy encourages cooperation when the stock is healthy, promoting a collective benefit. It adapts by defecting when necessary, ensuring individuals aren't exploited and maintaining the resource for future use.

---

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_stock = history[-1].stock if history else capacity
    round = len(history) + 1

    if round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif round == r:
        threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        if current_stock >= threshold:
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Defect"
    else:
        threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        if current_stock < threshold:
            return "Defect"
        else:
            return "Cooperate"
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to maximize initial stock.
- **Middle Rounds:** Defect if stock is below half capacity to conserve; otherwise, cooperate.
- **Last Round:** Cooperate if stock is sufficient, ensuring a positive end; defect if not.

This strategy adaptively responds to the state of the common pool, balancing individual and collective interests effectively.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_54 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that ensures both immediate gains and long-term sustainability. Here's a structured strategy based on the thought process:

### Collective Strategy: "Adaptive Sustainability with Reciprocity"

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **Stock Level Thresholds:**
  - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate (C) to allow resource regeneration.
  - If the stock is above 50%, defect with a probability proportional to the remaining rounds. Specifically, the probability of defecting increases as the game progresses towards the final round.

- **Reciprocity Mechanism:**
  - Observe the average number of cooperators in previous rounds. If at least half of the players cooperated last round, Cooperate again; otherwise, Defect.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline and conserve the resource.
- **Last Round (r):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future stock to preserve.
- **Low Stock (<20% of capacity):** Always Cooperate to prevent depletion and allow growth.

**3. Adaptive Elements:**

- Monitor the trend in stock levels over the past few rounds. If the stock is consistently decreasing despite cooperation, increase defection probability to avoid being exploited by defectors.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy_parameters(n, r, capacity):
    # Initialize cooperation threshold at 50% of capacity
    coop_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    # Determine last round number
    last_round = r

def decide_action(current_stock, current_round, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == last_round:
        return "D"
    elif current_stock < 0.2 * capacity:
        return "C"

    # Check if stock is below threshold
    if current_stock < coop_threshold:
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate probability of defecting based on remaining rounds
    prob_defect = (current_round / r) * 0.5
    
    # Reciprocity check: count average cooperators in last round
    avg_coop_last = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == "C") / n
    if avg_coop_last >= 0.5:
        return "C"
    
    # Decide based on probability and trend
    if current_stock_trend_decreasing():
        prob_defect += 0.2  # Adjust based on trend
    action = "D" if random() < prob_defect else "C"
    return action

def current_stock_trend_decreasing(history_stocks):
    # Implement logic to check if stock is decreasing over past rounds
    pass
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation in the first round to set a positive tone.
- **Stock Conservation:** Cooperates when the stock is low to ensure resource availability for future rounds.
- **Reciprocity:** Encourages cooperation if others have cooperated, promoting mutual benefit.
- **Adaptive Defection:** Adjusts defection probability based on game progression and stock trends, balancing immediate gains with sustainability.

This strategy aims to maximize total payoff by maintaining a sustainable stock level while adapting to the actions of other players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_55 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable common resource while maximizing individual payoffs, we can employ a strategy that balances cooperation and punishment based on the current state of the resource. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: "Sustainable Cooperation with Punishment"

1. **First Round**: Cooperate unconditionally.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the stock in the previous round was above 75% of capacity, continue to Cooperate.
   - If the stock was between 50-75%, Cooperate with a probability of 50%.
   - If the stock fell below 50%, Defect for that round.
3. **Punishment Mechanism**: If the stock drops by more than 10% in any single round, Defect for one subsequent round as punishment to deter over-exploitation.

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation encourages mutual benefit and sets a baseline of trust.
- **Stock-Based Decisions**: By monitoring the resource's health (stock levels), players adjust their behavior. High stock levels reinforce cooperation, while moderate levels introduce uncertainty, prompting a mixed strategy.
- **Punishment for Over-exploitation**: Significant drops in the stock trigger a punitive response, encouraging others to return to cooperative behavior and maintain resource sustainability.

This strategy aims to sustain the resource by penalizing overuse while allowing flexibility to adapt as conditions change.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_56 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Sustainability (ACS)**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Encourage mutual cooperation from the start, setting a positive precedent.

2. **Stock Threshold Monitoring:**
   - **Threshold (T):** Calculate as T = 0.8 * capacity
     - If stock ≥ T, continue cooperating.
     - If stock < T, switch to defecting.

3. **Peer Behavior Analysis:**
   - **Cooperation Rate (C):** Track the percentage of players who cooperated in previous rounds.
     - If C ≥ 75%, cooperate.
     - If C < 75%, defect.

4. **Final Round Strategy:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff since future stock doesn't matter.

5. **Adaptive Switching:**
   - Combine both thresholds:
     - Cooperate if stock ≥ T and C ≥ 75%.
     - Otherwise, defect.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```python
def ACS_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, total_rounds, prev_actions):
    # First Round Handling
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Stock Threshold Calculation
    T = 0.8 * capacity
    
    # Peer Behavior Analysis
    cooperation_rate = sum(1 for action in prev_actions[-1] if action == 'C') / n
    
    # Final Round Handling
    if round_num == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    
    # Adaptive Decision Making
    if current_stock >= T and cooperation_rate >= 0.75:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

# Example usage in a game context
n = 4
capacity = 100
current_stock = 80
round_num = 3
total_rounds = 10
prev_actions = [ ['C', 'C', 'C', 'C'], ['C', 'C', 'D', 'D'] ]

action = ACS_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, total_rounds, prev_actions)
print(action)  # Output: "C"
```

**Conclusion:**

The Adaptive Collective Sustainability strategy starts cooperatively to foster mutual trust. It adaptively switches based on stock levels and peer behavior, ensuring resource sustainability while protecting against exploitation. This balanced approach aims to maximize collective payoffs over the long term without relying on others' cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_57 = '''
To address the Tragedy of the Commons dilemma in this context, we can implement a strategy that promotes cooperation while incorporating mechanisms to deter excessive defection and ensure sustainable resource use. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Implementation:
1. **First Round Action:**
   - All players cooperate to establish a high stock level and set a cooperative precedent.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **If Current Stock > 70% of Capacity:**
     - Cooperate to maintain or increase the stock level, ensuring resource sustainability.
   - **If Current Stock is between 50% and 70% of Capacity:**
     - Cooperate only if more than half of the players cooperated in the previous round. Otherwise, defect to avoid further depletion.
   - **If Current Stock < 50% of Capacity:**
     - Defect to maximize immediate gains since collective cooperation isn't maintaining the stock adequately.

### Rationale:
- **High Stock Levels (Above 70%):** Cooperation is incentivized as it maintains a healthy stock, allowing for sustainable use and preventing future depletion.
- **Moderate Stock Levels (50-70%):** Conditional cooperation based on past actions discourages recent defections while encouraging a return to cooperative behavior if others comply.
- **Low Stock Levels (Below 50%):** Defection is favored as individual contributions to recovery are minimal, prioritizing immediate gains over uncertain future collective action.

This strategy balances individual incentives with collective sustainability, aiming to maintain resource levels while adapting to the actions of all players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_58 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACST)**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - All players Cooperate (C) to maximize initial payoff and maintain stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
   - Each player independently calculates:
     a. The number of players who Defected in the previous round (d).
     b. The current stock level (S).

3. **Decision Rules:**
   a. If the current stock S is below 50% of capacity, the player defects (D) to secure immediate gain.
   b. Else, if more than half of the players defected in the previous round (d > n/2), the player defects (D) as retaliation.
   c. Otherwise, the player Cooperates (C).

This strategy promotes cooperation when the stock is healthy and punishes defection to prevent overexploitation. It adapts based on both collective past behavior and current resource levels, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies while maintaining a collective approach.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_59 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperative Conservation (ACC)**

The ACC strategy is designed to maintain the sustainability of the common pool resource while encouraging cooperation among players. It uses a combination of stock-level monitoring and adaptive punishment mechanisms.

1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline.

2. **Stock-Level Threshold**: Players monitor the current stock level relative to capacity:
   - If the stock is above 70% of capacity, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock drops below 70%, switch to defecting temporarily to reduce consumption and allow regrowth.

3. **Defection Monitoring**: Track the number of defectors in the previous round:
   - If more than a certain threshold (e.g., 20%) of players defected last round, defect this round as punishment.
   - This temporary defection serves to deter excessive exploitation.

4. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After punishing for a set number of rounds, revert to cooperation if others resume cooperating. This prevents perpetual retaliation and allows the stock to recover.

5. **Final Rounds Consideration**: In the last few rounds, players may choose to cooperate more to maintain the stock's health, acknowledging the game's end and avoiding depletion.

This strategy balances resource conservation with adaptive responses to defection, promoting a sustainable equilibrium where cooperation is incentivized through both positive outcomes and targeted, forgiving punishments.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_60 = '''
**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and encourage others to reciprocate.

2. **Reciprocation and Sustainability:**
   - For rounds 2 to r-1:
     - **Action:** 
       - If the stock level is below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), Cooperate to allow regrowth.
       - Otherwise, mirror the majority action from the previous round. If most players cooperated, cooperate; if most defected, defect.

3. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** In the final round, prioritize immediate gain as future consequences don't apply. However, if the stock is critically low, consider cooperating to maintain a balance.

4. **Adaptive Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Track the number of defections in previous rounds.
   - If defections exceed a threshold (e.g., more than half the players defected last round), defect in the current round as retaliation.

5. **Stock Level Adjustments:**
   - Monitor the stock level relative to capacity. If it falls below a certain percentage, switch to cooperation temporarily to facilitate regrowth, regardless of previous actions.

6. **Balancing Individual and Collective Payoffs:**
   - The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by combining reciprocation with stock-level checks, ensuring that players neither exploit nor are exploited excessively.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history, current_stock, round):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round == r:
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C' if current_stock < critical_threshold else 'D'
    else:
        prev_actions = history[-1]
        count_defect = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
        if current_stock < sustainability_threshold:
            return 'C'
        elif count_defect > n/2:
            return 'D'  # Retaliate
        else:
            return 'C' if count_defect <= n/2 else 'D'

# Parameters:
- threshold: e.g., 0.5 * capacity (stock level where defecting is deemed safe)
- critical_threshold: e.g., 0.25 * capacity (where cooperation is necessary for regrowth)
```

This strategy encourages initial cooperation, adapts based on others' actions and stock levels, and adjusts in the last round to maximize payoffs while considering sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_61 = '''
To determine whether each player should cooperate or defect in each round based on the current stock level, we can use a threshold strategy. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players cooperate because the stock is at its maximum capacity.

2. **Threshold Check**: For subsequent rounds:
   - If the current stock level \( S_t \) is greater than half of the total capacity (\( 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \)), all players continue to cooperate.
   - If the stock level falls below or equals half of the capacity, all players defect.

3. **Recovery Mechanism**: When players defect due to low stock levels, their combined consumption reduces, allowing the stock to recover in subsequent rounds through growth.

This strategy balances maintaining high stock levels for sustained payoffs while allowing recovery when necessary.

**Final Answer:**
In each round, if the current stock level exceeds half of the total capacity, all players should cooperate. Otherwise, they should defect. This ensures sustainable resource management and recovery. 

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the stock is above half capacity; otherwise, defect.}}
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_62 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable stock level while maximizing individual payoffs, we'll adopt a strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on observed stock levels. The strategy is as follows:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, cooperate to start with the highest possible stock level.

2. **Threshold-Based Response**:
   - Set a threshold at half of the maximum capacity (T = capacity / 2).
   - For each subsequent round, observe the stock level after growth from the previous round.
   - If the stock level is above or equal to T, continue cooperating in the current round.
   - If the stock level falls below T, defect in the current round to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Recovery Mechanism**: Once the stock recovers above T in a subsequent round due to sufficient cooperation, revert to cooperating again.

This strategy encourages continued cooperation when the stock is healthy while allowing temporary defection to prevent significant losses if the stock dwindles below a critical threshold.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy involves cooperating in all rounds except when the stock falls below half its maximum capacity. When the stock is above this threshold, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect to protect your payoff.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the stock is above half capacity; otherwise, defect.}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_63 = '''
To address the challenge of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round, we can implement a balanced strategy that considers both the current stock level and the number of remaining rounds. This approach aims to maintain the stock for future rounds while allowing for maximizing payoffs when it's safer to do so.

### Strategy:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to start with a high stock level.
2. **Stock Threshold Check**: If the current stock is below 50% of the capacity, cooperate to allow regeneration.
3. **Remaining Rounds Consideration**: If more than half of the rounds remain (i.e., the current round number is less than half of the total rounds), cooperate to preserve the stock for future use.
4. **Defection Trigger**: If the stock is above 50% and fewer than half of the rounds remain, defect to maximize immediate payoff without causing severe depletion.

### Decision Rules:
- **Cooperate** if either:
   - The current stock level is below 50% of the capacity.
   - There are more than half of the total rounds remaining.
- **Defect** otherwise.

This strategy ensures that players maintain the stock when it's low and preserve it for future use when many rounds remain. As the game progresses and fewer rounds are left, players defect to maximize their payoffs without significantly harming future rounds.

**Strategy: Adaptive Sustainability with Reciprocity (ASR)**

**Overview:**
The ASR strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the common pool resource. It encourages cooperation while adaptively responding to the state of the stock and past player behavior, promoting a collective mindset.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Rounds:** 
   - In the first few rounds (e.g., first 5), always Cooperate (C). This helps establish a high stock level early on, encouraging sustainability.

2. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - Monitor the current stock level after each round.
     - If the stock is below 50% of capacity, switch to Cooperate (C) to help replenish it.
     - If the stock is between 50% and 90% of capacity, continue with the current strategy unless past behavior indicates a need for adjustment.

3. **Reciprocity Mechanism:**
   - Track the number of players defecting in previous rounds.
     - Cooperate if fewer than 30% defected in the last round.
     - Defect (D) if 30% or more defected, as it signals potential over-exploitation.

4. **Growth Phase Adjustment:**
   - If the stock is growing steadily (consistent growth each round), players may defect slightly to increase immediate payoffs while ensuring sustainability.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
- **Last Round:** Assess the current stock level. If it's above 70% of capacity, defect to maximize payoff; otherwise, cooperate to leave a sustainable level for future (if any).
- **Low Stock (<30%):** All players should Cooperate to prevent depletion and allow recovery.

**Collective Alignment:**
The ASR strategy is designed so that if all players follow it, they collectively maintain a high stock level, ensuring sustained payoffs over all rounds. It discourages excessive defection by responding to both stock levels and others' actions, promoting mutual benefit.

This approach ensures that individual actions contribute to the group's long-term success while being robust against varying opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_65 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a robust collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances individual payoffs with the sustainability of the common resource. This strategy is designed to encourage cooperation while protecting against exploitation.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline and maintain the stock at its maximum capacity.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Observe Previous Round's Data:** Note the number of players who defected (D_{t-1}) and the current stock level (S_t).
   - **Thresholds:**
     - Stock Threshold (S_threshold): Set at half the capacity (0.5 * capacity).
     - Defection Threshold (T): The maximum number of allowable defections, set to half the number of players (n/2).
   - **Decision Making:**
     - If S_t > S_threshold and D_{t-1} ≤ T: Cooperate.
     - Else: Defect.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Always defect to maximize personal payoff since there are no future rounds where cooperation could be punished.

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation in Early Rounds:** Encourages resource sustainability and higher collective payoffs when the stock is healthy.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** Deters excessive defection by switching to defection if too many players have defected or the stock is depleted beyond a safe threshold.
- **Final Round Defection:** Maximizes immediate payoff without fear of future repercussions, aligning with game theory's prediction of unraveling cooperation in the last round.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_punishment(n, r, capacity):
    # Initialize action history and stock levels
    actions = []
    stock_levels = [capacity]  # Initial stock
    
    # First round: Cooperate
    action = 'C'
    actions.append(action)
    
    for t in range(1, r):
        current_stock = stock_levels[t]
        prev_actions = actions[:t]
        D_prev = sum(1 for a in prev_actions if a == 'D')
        
        S_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        T = n / 2
        
        if t == r - 1:
            # Last round: Defect
            action = 'D'
        else:
            if current_stock > S_threshold and D_prev <= T:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'
        
        actions.append(action)
        # Update stock based on all players' actions, but for strategy purposes, we focus on the decision logic
        
    return actions
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization:** The strategy starts by cooperating in the first round to maintain the stock.
- **Observation and Thresholds:** Each subsequent round evaluates the stock level and previous defections. If both conditions (stock above threshold and few defections) are met, cooperation continues; otherwise, the strategy defects.
- **Final Round Exception:** Defects in the last round to secure immediate gain.

This approach ensures that players collectively maintain the resource while safeguarding against over-exploitation, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.

To address the challenge of maintaining the stock level while encouraging cooperation among players, we can implement a trigger strategy. This strategy balances cooperation with punishment for defection, ensuring that the stock remains sustainable over the game's duration.

**Strategy:**

1. **First Round:** Cooperate. All players take the cooperative amount (stock/(2n)) to ensure minimal consumption and allow maximum growth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - After each round, calculate whether the previous round's total consumption exceeded half of the stock before that round. This is determined by checking if the remaining stock after consumption was below half of its initial value for that round.
   - If the stock after consumption (S_remaining) was below half of its pre-consumption value (i.e., S_remaining < capacity/2), it indicates that excessive defection occurred. In response, defect this round by taking the full amount (stock/n).
   - If S_remaining was equal to or above half of its pre-consumption value, continue cooperating.

**Explanation:**

- **Cooperation:** By taking the smaller share initially, players ensure the stock remains high and grows over time.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** When the stock drops significantly (below half), it signals that some players defected. Defecting in response punishes those who did not cooperate, encouraging them to return to cooperative behavior to avoid further depletion.

This strategy aims to maintain a sustainable balance, rewarding cooperation and penalizing excessive defection without leading to complete resource exhaustion.

To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maintain resource sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs. This strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors and ensures long-term resource health.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players cooperate (C). This sets a baseline of trust and allows the stock to remain at its maximum capacity, ensuring optimal growth.

2. **Adaptive Response Based on Stock Level:**
   - After the initial round, players monitor the stock level after each round.
     - If the stock remains above 75% of its maximum capacity (C), continue cooperating.
     - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to defection for one or two rounds. This acts as a punitive measure against over-exploitation and encourages others to cooperate.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last 20% of the rounds, players switch to defection (D). Since there are limited future interactions, the incentive to maximize personal gain increases, making defection more beneficial in the endgame.

### Detailed Mechanism:

- **Cooperation Threshold:** Players cooperate if the stock is above 75% of capacity. This ensures that the resource remains healthy and sustainable.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** If the stock drops below 75%, players defect for a limited period to signal dissatisfaction and encourage others to return to cooperation.
- **Endgame Defection:** As the game nears its conclusion, players prioritize immediate gains over long-term sustainability, leading to defection in the final stages.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation** fosters mutual trust and maintains high resource levels, promoting growth.
- **Adaptive Response** ensures that players react to resource depletion by temporarily defecting, thereby punishing defectors and encouraging a return to cooperative behavior.
- **Endgame Defection** acknowledges the reduced effectiveness of punishment in the final rounds, allowing players to maximize their payoffs when future interactions are limited.

This strategy is designed to be simple yet effective, ensuring that players act in their self-interest while contributing to the sustainability of the shared resource.

description_COLLECTIVE_68 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that balances cooperation and defection to maximize total payoff while maintaining stock sustainability, we propose the following approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual and collective payoffs by maintaining a sustainable common pool resource through adaptive cooperation based on observed stock levels.

---

#### 1. Decision Rules

- **First Round (t = 1):**
  - All players Cooperate (C).
    - This initializes the game with maximum cooperation, setting a high starting stock level to encourage sustainability and fairness.

- **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
  - Each player observes the current stock level \( S_t \) after growth from the previous round.
  - Players cooperate if:
    \[
    S_t > \frac{\text{capacity}}{2}
    \]
    Otherwise, players Defect (D).

---

#### 2. Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation ensures that the stock remains at maximum capacity initially, promoting a collaborative environment.
  
- **Stock Threshold:** By setting a threshold of 50% of the capacity, players collectively aim to maintain a healthy stock level. If the stock drops below this threshold, it signals potential overexploitation, prompting players to defect to secure immediate gains before further depletion.

---

#### 3. Example Walkthrough

**Example Parameters:**
- Number of players \( n = 4 \)
- Capacity \( C = 100 \)

1. **Round 1:** All Cooperate.
   - Stock remains at 100.

2. **Round 2:** Suppose two players Defect and two Cooperate.
   - Consumption: \( 2 \times 25 + 2 \times 12.5 = 75 \)
   - Remaining stock after consumption: \( 25 \)
   - Growth: \( 2 \times 25 \times (1 - 0.25) = 37.5 \)
   - New stock: \( 62.5 \)
   - Since \( 62.5 > 50 \), players Cooperate in the next round.

3. **Round where Stock Drops Below Threshold:** 
   - Suppose in a subsequent round, three Defect and one Cooperates.
     - Consumption: \( 75 + 12.5 = 87.5 \)
     - Remaining stock after consumption: \( 12.5 \)
     - Growth: Approximately \( 23.4375 \), new stock ≈ \( 35.9375 \).
   - Since \( 35.9375 < 50 \), players Defect in the next round.

4. **Final Rounds with Low Stock:** 
   - If stock drops below threshold, continued Defection may lead to depletion, but this strategy ensures that players maximize their payoffs when sustainability is no longer viable.

---

#### 4. Advantages

- **Simplicity and Observability:** The strategy relies solely on the current stock level, which is observable by all players, making it easy to implement without complex calculations or communication.
  
- **Balance Between Cooperation and Self-interest:** Encourages cooperation when the resource is plentiful but allows for strategic defection when sustainability is compromised.

---

#### 5. Limitations

- **Risk of Rapid Depletion:** Once the stock drops below the threshold, collective defection can lead to rapid depletion in subsequent rounds.
  
- **No Forgiveness Mechanism:** The strategy does not account for reverting to cooperation after stock recovery without external factors or additional mechanisms.

---

### Conclusion

The Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC) strategy provides a balanced approach by fostering initial cooperation and switching to defection when resource sustainability is threatened. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while considering the collective need for resource conservation, making it suitable for scenarios where players prioritize both immediate gains and long-term sustainability.

---

**Final Answer**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate if the current stock exceeds 50% of capacity; otherwise, defect. Thus, the final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S_t > \frac{\text{capacity}}{2} \text{; otherwise, Defect}}

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** All players Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial stock growth.
   - **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1):**
     - If any player Defected in the previous round, all players Defect in the current round as punishment.
     - If no one Defected in the previous round, all players Cooperate.
     - Additionally, if the stock level after growth is below 50% of capacity, all players Cooperate to replenish the stock, regardless of previous actions.
   - **Last Round (r):** All players Cooperate if the stock is above 50% of capacity; otherwise, they Defect.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to ensure maximum initial stock growth and set a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Round:** Cooperate if the stock is sufficient to avoid depletion, ensuring a fair payoff without jeopardizing future rounds (though in reality, without future repercussions, players might still choose to Defect).
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize Cooperation when the stock drops below 50% of capacity to facilitate recovery.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
   The strategy is designed to promote cooperation while allowing for punishment and adaptation based on observed actions and stock levels. It encourages players to maintain a sustainable resource, balancing individual gains with collective well-being.

This approach aims to prevent the tragedy of the commons by fostering cooperation through mutual monitoring and graduated responses, ensuring long-term sustainability and maximizing total payoffs across all rounds.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - All players Cooperate (C) in the first round to maximize initial stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Excluding Last Round):**
   - **Threshold Check:** Determine if the current stock is above a predefined threshold, set at 75% of capacity.
     - If the stock is above or equal to 75% of capacity: Cooperate (C).
     - If the stock falls below 75% of capacity: Defect (D).

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - In the final round, all players Defect (D) to maximize immediate individual payoff without concern for future rounds.

This strategy balances cooperation to sustain the common resource with strategic defection when the resource is depleted beyond a critical point or in the last round. It encourages collective responsibility while adapting to the state of the stock and the game's progression.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_71 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining optimal cooperation in a repeated game where each player's decision affects the common resource (stock), we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with punishment for excessive defection.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial stock levels.
2. **Monitor Previous Actions and Stock Levels:** After each round, observe both the number of players who defected and the resulting stock level.
3. **Threshold-Based Response:**
   - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, or if the stock has dropped below 50% of its capacity, switch to defection in the current round.
   - Otherwise, continue cooperating.

This strategy encourages sustained cooperation when beneficial but allows for a timely response to prevent resource depletion by switching to defection when necessary.

### Formalized Strategy:
```python
def decide_action(previous_actions, previous_stock, capacity):
    if not previous_actions:  # First round
        return "Cooperate"
    
    defector_count = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == "Defect")
    stock_threshold = capacity / 2
    
    if (defector_count > len(previous_actions) / 2) or (previous_stock < stock_threshold):
        return "Defect"
    else:
        return "Cooperate"
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, players aim to maintain a high stock level from the beginning.
- **Responsive Adaptation:** The strategy dynamically adjusts based on observed behavior and resource status. If too many defect or the stock significantly decreases, players switch strategies to mitigate losses.
- **Balance Between Cooperation and Self-interest:** This approach ensures that each player contributes to the common good while protecting against exploitation by others who might defect excessively.

This balanced strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while preserving the resource for future rounds through adaptive cooperation.

description_COLLECTIVE_72 = '''
**Adaptive Cooperation with Gradual Punishment Strategy**

The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, fostering cooperation while deterring exploitation.

1. **Initial Cooperation (Round 1):**
   - All players Cooperate (C) in the first round to establish a cooperative foundation and maximize future stock levels.

2. **Sustained Cooperation:**
   - If the stock remains above 90% of capacity, continue Cooperating. This maintains high stock levels, ensuring continued growth and payoffs.

3. **Gradual Punishment Mechanism:**
   - If stock drops below 90%, players Defect (D) in the next round if they defected previously. This gradual response aims to penalize defectors without causing drastic stock depletion.
   - Limit punishment to a set number of rounds (e.g., 3) to avoid endless cycles of retaliation.

4. **Rebuilding Phase:**
   - After punishing, revert to Cooperation to allow stock recovery, essential for sustained payoffs.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds don't exist.
   - **Low Stock (below 10%):** Prioritize consumption by Defecting, as the resource won't sustain future use.

**Considerations and Robustness:**

- The strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, discouraging exploitation through measured responses.
- Thresholds (90%, 20%) can be adjusted based on parameters like n and capacity for optimal effectiveness.
- Emphasizes restarting cooperation after punishment to maintain resource health.

This approach aligns with a collective mindset by prioritizing stock preservation through monitoring and adaptive responses, balancing individual gains with communal benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_73 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - All players Cooperate (C).

2. **Final Round Action:**
   - In the last round, all players Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Intermediate Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock level is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate to allow regeneration.
   - **Defection Monitoring:** Calculate the average number of Defectors in the past three rounds relative to total possible actions (avg_defection).
     - If avg_defection exceeds 25%, switch to Defecting for retaliation.
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating.

**Pseudocode:**

```
def strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, round, history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate average defection rate over last 3 rounds
        total_defections = sum([actions.count('D') for actions in history[-3:]])
        avg_defection = total_defections / (3 * n)
        
        if stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif avg_defection > 0.25:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

**Explanation:**
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and resource sustainability.
- **Final Round:** Defect to maximize personal gain as future consequences are irrelevant.
- **Stock Conservation:** If the stock is critically low, prioritize regeneration through cooperation.
- **Retaliation Mechanism:** Punish excessive defection by switching to defecting if 25% or more of previous actions were Ds, encouraging others to cooperate.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability, adapting based on environmental and social cues.

description_COLLECTIVE_74 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Stock Preservation (ASP)

**Objective:**  
To maximize collective payoff over all rounds while maintaining a sustainable stock level, ensuring future rounds' viability.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round Action:**  
   - Cooperate (C): All players start by cooperating to establish a high initial payoff and maintain the stock at its maximum capacity.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**  
   - **Threshold Check:** Calculate the threshold as half of the game's capacity (capacity / 2).  
     - If the current stock level is above this threshold, continue Cooperating (C) to sustain the stock and maintain higher payoffs.  
     - If the stock drops below or equals the threshold, switch to Defecting (D) to secure immediate gains before potential depletion.

3. **Final Round Action:**  
   - Defect (D): In the last round, all players defect to maximize their immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock reaches zero in any round before the last, all subsequent actions should be to Defect (D) as cooperation yields no benefit.
- **Early Cooperation:** Encourage cooperation unless the stock significantly drops, ensuring sustainability while allowing for strategic defecting when necessary.

**Collective Alignment:**

This strategy promotes a collective mindset by aligning individual actions with group interests. Players cooperate to maintain a healthy stock, only switching to defection when the stock is threatened, thus balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```python
def asp_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"
    threshold = capacity / 2
    if current_stock > threshold and round_number != total_rounds:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

# Example usage in a game:
strategy_action = asp_strategy(n=4, capacity=100, current_stock=75, round_number=3, total_rounds=10)
print(strategy_action)  # Output: 'C'
```

**Rationale:**  
ASP strategy starts cooperatively to maximize initial payoffs and maintain stock health. It adaptively switches to defection when the stock is at risk, ensuring players protect their interests while considering future rounds. This balance makes ASP robust against various opponent behaviors in a tournament setting.

description_COLLECTIVE_75 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

1. **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate for the first few rounds to establish cooperation and maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Stock Threshold Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the stock level relative to capacity. If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, switch to defecting to secure personal gains before potential depletion.

3. **Punishment Mechanism**: Track the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than half of the players defected, retaliate by defecting in the current round to avoid being exploited.

4. **Re-establish Cooperation**: Once the stock recovers above 50% and fewer than half of the players defected in the previous round, switch back to cooperation.

5. **Last Round Maximization**: In the final round, always choose to Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future consequences.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```
Initialize:
    action_history = {}  # Stores actions of all players for each round
    current_stock = capacity

For each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        choose C
    else:
        previous_actions = action_history[t-1]
        count_defectors = number of D in previous_actions
        if current_stock < (capacity / 2):
            choose D
        elif count_defectors > n/2:
            choose D
        else:
            choose C

    record own action and update action_history with all players' actions for round t

After all rounds, total_payoff is calculated as the sum of individual payoffs per round.
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to foster a collaborative environment, ensuring initial stock sustainability.

- **Stock-Based Adaptation**: By monitoring the stock level and switching strategies when it drops below half capacity, players balance immediate gains with long-term resource health.

- **Punishment for Defection**: Players retaliate against widespread defection by defecting themselves in subsequent rounds, discouraging others from exploiting the common pool.

- **Cooperation Re-establishment**: When conditions improve (stock above 50% and fewer defectors), players revert to cooperation to rebuild the resource for future rounds.

- **Final Round Maximization**: In the last round, defecting ensures each player maximizes their immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

This strategy aims to balance individual gain with collective sustainability, adapting dynamically based on game state and opponent behavior.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperative Guardian (ACG)**

The ACG strategy is designed to balance individual payoffs with collective sustainability in a Common Pool Resource Game. It adapts based on historical cooperation levels and current stock conditions.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to initiate mutual cooperation.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1)**:
   - **Calculate Average Cooperation Rate**: Determine the average number of players who cooperated in previous rounds.
   - **Stock Level Check**: Assess if the current stock is above 50% of capacity.
   - **Decision**:
     - If the average cooperation rate is ≥70% AND current stock ≥50%, Cooperate (C).
     - Otherwise, Defect (D).
3. **Last Round (r)**: Follow the same rules as other rounds to maintain consistency and avoid last-round exploitation.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Low Stock**: Prioritize cooperation if the stock is below 50% of capacity to encourage regrowth.
- **High Defection**: If historical cooperation falls below the threshold, defect to protect individual payoffs.

### Implementation Pseudocode:

```python
def adaptive_cooperative_guardian(n, r, capacity, history, current_stock):
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return "C"
    
    avg_cooperation = sum([1 for action in history[-n:] if action == 'C']) / n
    
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    
    if avg_cooperation >= 0.7 and stock_ratio >= 0.5:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"
```

### Strategy Overview:
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts based on cooperation history and stock levels.
- **Robust**: Balances individual and collective benefits to sustain resource use.
- **Fairness**: Encourages cooperation while protecting against excessive defection.

This strategy promotes a dynamic approach, fostering cooperation when beneficial and defecting to safeguard payoffs when necessary.

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold and Defection Response**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Start with cooperation to establish a high initial stock level, encouraging mutual benefit from the beginning.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Parameters:**
     - `threshold_stock = 0.5 * capacity` (50% of maximum sustainable stock)
     - `defection_threshold = 0.5` (50% of players)
   - **Decision Rules:**
     - Observe the stock level after the previous round (`S_prev`) and count how many players defected in the last round.
     - If both conditions are met:
       - `S_prev > threshold_stock`
       - Proportion of defectors < `defection_threshold`
         - Choose to Cooperate (C) to maintain a healthy stock level and encourage continued cooperation.
     - Else:
         - Defect (D) to protect against exploitation or prevent stock depletion.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Since there are no future rounds, prioritize immediate gain by consuming more from the stock without concern for sustainability.

            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

**Rationale:**
- **Cooperation in Early Rounds:** Encourages stock preservation for future benefits.
- **Adaptive Response:** Switches to defection when the stock is low or many players defected, preventing exploitation and resource depletion.
- **Final Round Defection:** Maximizes immediate payoff without future consequences.

This strategy balances cooperation with self-protection, aiming to sustain the common pool while adapting to others' actions.

     - If the stock level is between 50% and 75%, use a mixed strategy where the probability of Cooperating decreases linearly from 100% to 50%.
     - If the stock level falls below 50%, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**

To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in a repeated game with dynamic stock resources, we can use an adaptive strategy that balances maintaining future resource availability with maximizing current gains. The strategy considers both the current stock level and past actions of other players.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 rounds):**
   - Always Cooperate to encourage others to do the same and build a foundation for sustainable resource use.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**

     - If fewer than half the players Defected in the previous round, continue to Cooperate.
   - **Stock Between 50% and 75% of Capacity:**
     - Cooperate only if more than half of the players Cooperated in the previous round. Otherwise, Defect.
   - **Stock Below 50% of Capacity:**
     - Defect to maximize current gains, as future rounds may not recover the stock sufficiently.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 2 rounds):**
   - Always Defect since there are limited future rounds to consider, prioritizing immediate gain.

This strategy is designed to adapt based on both the resource's health and others' past behavior, promoting cooperation when sustainable but switching to defection when necessary.

description_COLLECTIVE_80 = '''
**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock Levels**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone and allows the stock to regenerate fully if all players cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Observe Stock Level**: After each round, check the current stock level.
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: If the stock is above 50% of the capacity, continue Cooperating (C). This encourages sustainable use and allows stock regeneration.
   - **Defection Trigger**: If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, switch to Defecting (D) for one round. This action signals dissatisfaction with over-exploitation and may prompt others to adjust their strategies.

3. **Post-Defection Strategy**:
   - After defecting once, monitor the stock level in the next round.
   - If the stock recovers to above 50% of capacity, revert to Cooperating (C).
   - If the stock remains below 50%, continue Defecting (D) until recovery.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **Last Round**: In the final round, if the stock is sufficiently high, players may choose to defect to maximize immediate gain since there's no future round to affect.
   - **Persistent Low Stock**: If the stock remains below 50% for multiple rounds despite some defection, consider continued Defection until recovery trends are observed.

This strategy aims to balance cooperation with adaptive responses to resource exploitation, using stock levels as a collective signal for behavior adjustment.

description_COLLECTIVE_81 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Threshold Calculation:** Each player determines a dynamic threshold based on the remaining rounds. The threshold starts at 50% of capacity in early rounds and gradually decreases as the game progresses, particularly in the last few rounds.
   - **Cooperation Zone:** If the current stock is above the threshold, the player Cooperates (C). This helps maintain the stock for future rounds.
   - **Defection Zone:** If the stock falls below the threshold, the player Defects (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate trust and sustain the stock.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Lower the threshold or switch to defection more readily to secure payoffs before game end.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy relies on shared observations of the stock level, promoting implicit coordination without communication. Players independently adjust their actions based on common knowledge of the game state.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
function decide_action(current_stock, capacity, round, total_rounds):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        threshold = calculate_threshold(round, total_rounds)
        if current_stock > (threshold * capacity):
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"

function calculate_threshold(round, total_rounds):
    # Example: Linear decrease from 0.5 to 0.2 as rounds progress
    start_threshold = 0.5
    end_threshold = 0.2
    decay_rate = (start_threshold - end_threshold) / total_rounds
    return max(end_threshold, start_threshold - decay_rate * round)
```

This strategy balances cooperation and defection based on stock levels and game progression, ensuring sustainable payoffs while adapting to dynamic conditions.

**Adaptive Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Initial Cooperation Phase:**
- **First 25% of Rounds:** Cooperate (C) to establish trust and maintain a robust stock level.

**2. Stock Level Monitoring:**
- After each round, assess the current stock level.
- If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, switch strategy to Defect (D) in the next round to prevent further depletion.

**3. Reciprocal Response:**
- Observe the total consumption from previous rounds.
- If high consumption indicates widespread defection, defect in the upcoming round to protect individual payoffs.

**4. Endgame Strategy:**
- In the last few rounds (e.g., final 10%), prioritize immediate payoff by choosing Defect (D), especially if stock levels are low.

**5. Adaptive Reconciliation:**
- If cooperation from others leads to stock recovery, revert to Cooperate (C) to sustain long-term benefits.

This strategy balances initial cooperation with adaptive responses to maintain individual gains while considering collective sustainability. It dynamically adjusts based on stock health and opponents' actions, ensuring a robust approach in diverse scenarios.

To address the problem of determining the optimal action in each round of a game where players can choose to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), we need a strategy that balances cooperation with the necessity to conserve resources when they are low and to defect when others exploit. Here's a structured approach based on the reasoning above:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Conservation

1. **Initial Action**:
   - In the first round, always Cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (from t=2 to r)**:
   - **Check Current Stock**: If the current stock level is below half of the capacity, choose to Cooperate to help conserve and rebuild the stock.
   - **Assess Previous Round's Behavior**:
     - If the number of players who Defected in the previous round exceeds half of the total players, then choose to Defect in the current round to avoid being exploited.
     - Otherwise, continue to Cooperate, maintaining a collaborative approach when there are sufficient cooperators and the stock is healthy.

### Summary:

- **Round 1**: Always Cooperate (C).
- **Rounds 2 to r**:
  - If Stock < 50% of Capacity → C.
  - Else, if Previous Defectors > 50% → D.
  - Else → C.

This strategy ensures that players conserve resources when necessary and respond appropriately to exploitation by others.

description_COLLECTIVE_84 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for an AI deciding whether to cooperate or defect each round without prior communication with other players, we analyzed various approaches considering cooperation and defection dynamics. The key insights are:

1. **Cooperation Maximizes Long-term Payoffs**: Continuous cooperation by all players maintains the stock at capacity, ensuring maximum sustainable consumption.
2. **Impact of Defection**: Any defection reduces the stock, potentially leading to its depletion if not addressed. Retaliatory defection can prevent being exploited but risks reducing overall payoffs.
3. **Grim Trigger Strategy**: This strategy involves cooperating until any defection is detected, after which the AI defects permanently. It serves as a credible punishment mechanism, encouraging others to cooperate.

**Conclusion**: The AI should adopt a grim trigger strategy—cooperate unless a defection has occurred in previous rounds, in which case it will defect indefinitely to avoid exploitation and maintain fairness. This approach balances cooperation with necessary punishment to sustain optimal outcomes when possible.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate until any player defects; then defect permanently.}}$

To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we'll employ an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observable state variables. This strategy aims to sustain the common pool while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Threshold-based Cooperation (ATC)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Cooperate (C)** if the current stock level is above a certain threshold.
- **Defect (D)** if the stock falls below this threshold.

**Threshold Calculation**: 
- Let the threshold be set at 75% of the capacity. This is a heuristic value that can be adjusted based on empirical testing or theoretical optimization.

#### 2. Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round**: Start with Cooperation to promote initial resource sustainability.
- **Last Round (r)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.

#### 3. Adaptive Mechanism:
- After each round, assess the stock level relative to the threshold.
- If the stock is above the threshold after growth, continue Cooperating.
- If it drops below, switch to Defection in the subsequent rounds until the stock recovers above the threshold.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_threshold_cooperation(n, capacity, current_stock, round, total_rounds):
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # Adjust based on game parameters

    if round == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round == total_rounds:
        return "D"  # Defect in the last round
    
    if current_stock >= threshold:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

# Example usage within a round simulation
strategy = adaptive_threshold_cooperation(n, capacity, stock_level, current_round, r)
action = strategy
```

### Strategy Explanation:

- **Cooperation Threshold**: Players cooperate when the stock is above 75% of capacity to ensure sustainability.
- **Defection Trigger**: If the stock drops below the threshold, players defect to secure higher immediate payoffs.
- **Edge Cases**: The first round encourages cooperation to build a sustainable resource base. In the last round, defection is strategic as there are no future consequences.

This strategy promotes long-term resource management while allowing for strategic adjustments based on the current state of the common pool. It's robust against various opponent behaviors and adapts dynamically to maintain balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.

**Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)**

The Adaptive Threshold Cooperation strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability in the Common Pool Resource game. Players use a threshold based on the capacity to decide their actions, adapting as the game progresses.

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initialize a high stock level.
   - **Subsequent Rounds (until last round):** 
     - If current stock > capacity / 2 → Cooperate.
     - If current stock ≤ capacity / 2 → Defect.
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round Handling:** Ensures initial cooperation to build trust and maintain a healthy stock.
   - **Last Round Handling:** Prioritizes immediate gains since future rounds don't exist.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - Promotes sustainability by cooperating when the stock is sufficient, ensuring resource availability for future rounds.
   - Adapts to exploitation by switching to defection if the stock depletes beyond a sustainable level.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```python
def adaptive_threshold_cooperation(stock, capacity, round_num, total_rounds):
    threshold = capacity / 2
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round_num == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        if stock > threshold:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

This strategy is robust and adaptive, encouraging cooperation to maintain resource sustainability while allowing strategic defection when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_87 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can employ an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on the current state of the stock and historical behavior. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Sustainability with Punishment (ASP)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: All players cooperate to maximize initial payoffs without depleting the resource.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - **Cooperate** if the current stock is above 75% of capacity, indicating a sustainable level that allows for regeneration.
  - **Defect** if the stock falls below this threshold to secure individual payoffs before potential depletion.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **Last Round**: Cooperate only if the stock is at or near capacity; otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.
- **Stock Depletion**: If the stock drops significantly (e.g., below 25% of capacity), players should cooperate to allow regeneration and prevent a collapse of the resource.

#### 3. Collective Mindset:
The strategy encourages cooperation when the resource is plentiful, ensuring sustainability and collective benefit. When the stock is low, players prioritize individual gains but revert to cooperation once the resource recovers, fostering long-term sustainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def ASP_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, history):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

# In last round, adjust strategy
if round_num == total_rounds:
    if current_stock >= 0.9 * capacity:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"
```

### Explanation:

- **Cooperation Threshold**: The threshold of 75% of capacity is chosen to ensure that the stock can regenerate sufficiently each round, maintaining a sustainable level for future rounds.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Players switch strategies based on observable stock levels, promoting cooperation when it benefits everyone and defecting to protect individual payoffs when necessary.
- **Final Round Adjustment**: In the last round, players cooperate only if the stock is near full capacity, ensuring they end on a sustainable note without compromising their final payoff.

This strategy aims to balance individual incentives with collective sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while promoting cooperation when beneficial.

2. **Reciprocal Cooperation:**
   - If all players cooperated in the previous round, continue to cooperate.
   - Sustains a healthy stock level and mutual benefit.

3. **Punishment for Defection:**
   - If any player defected last round, defect this round (D).
   - Prevents exploitation by punishing past defections, then revert to cooperation.

4. **Stock Conservation Threshold:**
   - If stock drops below capacity/2, switch to cooperation.
   - Ensures resource sustainability and prevents depletion.

5. **Final Round Cooperation:**
   - Regardless of history, cooperate in the last round.
   - Maintains fairness and ends on a cooperative note for future interactions.

description_COLLECTIVE_89 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for a repeated game scenario where players can either cooperate (C) or defect (D), we need to balance maintaining the resource for future rounds with maximizing immediate payoffs, especially in the final round. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Development
1. **First Round**: Cooperate.
   - Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and maximizes collective payoff from the outset.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Number of Defectors (D_count)**: Count how many players defected in the previous round.
   - **Stock Level (S)**: Check if the remaining stock is above half of its capacity.
   - If both conditions are met (D_count < n/2 and S > capacity / 2), continue to Cooperate. This maintains the resource for future rounds while ensuring fair play.
   - If either condition fails, Defect to avoid being exploited or to secure higher payoffs when the stock is low.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Always Defect.
   - In the final round, there’s no future consequence, so maximizing immediate payoff is optimal.

### Rationale
- **Cooperation in Early Rounds**: Maintains a healthy stock level and encourages continued cooperation among players.
- **Defection When Necessary**: Protects against exploitation if many defect or if the stock dwindles.
- **Last Round Defection**: Maximizes immediate gain without concern for future repercussions.

This strategy effectively balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, ensuring players aren't exploited while securing maximum payoffs when possible.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperative Guardian (ACG)

**Objective:** Balance between maximizing individual payoffs and maintaining the sustainability of the common pool resource through adaptive cooperation based on observed behavior and stock levels.

---

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a pattern that maintains the stock at a sustainable level, encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (2 ≤ t < r):**
   - **Monitor Stock Level and Recent Behavior:**
     - Calculate `S_remaining` after consumption in previous rounds.
     - Track the number of players who Defected in the last few rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds).
   - **Decision Criteria:**
     - If `S_remaining` > 50% of capacity AND fewer than half of the players defected recently:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C) to sustain the stock and encourage collective payoff.
     - If `S_remaining` ≤ 50% of capacity OR more than half of the players defected recently:
       - **Action:** Defect (D) to protect individual payoff and avoid being exploited.

3. **Last Round (t = r):**
   - **Evaluate Stock Level:**
     - If `S_remaining` > 25% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C) to ensure a decent payoff without over-depletion.
     - If `S_remaining` ≤ 25% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate gain, as there’s no future round.

4. **Adaptation Mechanism:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level and the number of defectors in recent rounds.
   - Adjust the cooperation threshold dynamically based on observed behavior to maintain a balance between personal gain and resource sustainability.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If the stock is ever depleted (S = 0), switch permanently to Defect for all subsequent rounds, as no growth can occur without remaining stock.

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def adaptive_cooperative_guardian(n, r, capacity, history):
    if not history:  # First round
        return 'C'
    
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    recent_defectors = sum(1 for i in range(min(len(history), 3)) 
                           if history[-i-1]['actions'].count('D') > n/2)
    
    if len(history) == r - 1:  # Last round
        if current_stock > capacity / 4:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    
    if current_stock > capacity / 2 and recent_defectors < (n // 2):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **First Round Cooperation:** Establishes a cooperative baseline, promoting sustainability.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Uses recent stock levels and player behavior to decide actions, ensuring flexibility against varying strategies.
- **Last Round Pragmatism:** Balances immediate gain with resource preservation, considering the final round's irreversible impact.

This strategy aims to foster cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation, promoting a resilient approach to managing the common pool resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_91 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation in a common-pool resource game while deterring excessive defection, we propose a strategy that balances individual incentives with collective well-being. The key is to use a threshold-based approach that reacts to the overall state of the resource.

### Strategy:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Always cooperate in the first round.
2. **Threshold-Based Reaction**:
   - In each subsequent round, observe the stock level after the previous round.
   - If the stock level is at least 70% of the capacity (0.7 * C), continue to cooperate.
   - If the stock level drops below this threshold, defect in the next round.

### Explanation:
- **First Round**: Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and maximize collective benefit.
- **Threshold Check**: After each round, assess whether the resource's health (stock level) is above or below 70% of its capacity. This threshold serves as an indicator of whether others are cooperating sufficiently.
  - **Above Threshold**: Cooperate to maintain the resource and encourage others to do the same.
  - **Below Threshold**: Defect to punish those who may be over-exploiting, aiming to reset cooperation in subsequent rounds.

This strategy provides a clear incentive structure where cooperation is rewarded with resource sustainability, while defection is met with retaliatory measures to prevent collapse.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Strategy Overview:**
The strategy is designed to balance individual and collective interests through adaptive cooperation and calibrated punishment. It begins with cooperation to establish trust and maintain resource sustainability. If the common pool's health declines, indicating potential defection by others, the strategy shifts to temporary punishment via defection to protect one's own payoffs. Once the stock shows signs of recovery, cooperation resumes.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C). This sets a precedent for high initial stock levels and encourages mutual cooperation from the start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Stock Level**: Observe the current stock level after each round.
   - **Threshold Check**: If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, switch to Defecting (D) for the next two rounds as a punitive measure. This signals disapproval of over-exploitation and protects against further depletion.
   - **Forgiveness Phase**: After defecting for two rounds, revert to Cooperation if the stock shows an increasing trend in the last observed round. This phase encourages recovery of the resource.

3. **Final Rounds Consideration**: Maintain cooperation unless the stock is critically low (below 25% of capacity), where temporary defection may be necessary to secure final payoffs without causing irreversible depletion.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **Low Stock Scenario**: If the stock drops below a critical threshold, defect temporarily to prevent complete depletion but return to cooperation once recovery begins.
- **Sustained Cooperation**: If the stock remains above 75% of capacity with steady growth, continue cooperating to maximize long-term payoffs.

**Implementation Logic:**

```pseudocode
Initialize:
    cooperate = True

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round:
        action = C
    else:
        previous_stock = stock after last round's consumption and growth
        if previous_stock < capacity * 0.5:
            // Stock is depleted, defect for next two rounds
            cooperate = False
            actions_counted = 0
        elif not cooperate and actions_counted < 2:
            action = D
            actions_counted += 1
        else:
            // Return to cooperation if stock recovers
            if previous_stock > current_stock or (stock growth is positive):
                cooperate = True
                action = C

    consume from the common pool based on action
    update stock level after consumption and growth
```

**Collective Alignment:**
This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by prioritizing sustainability. It encourages cooperation as the default but includes mechanisms to deter exploitation, ensuring that individual actions contribute to the group's long-term benefit.

By focusing on observable game states and employing adaptive measures, this approach fosters resilience against various opponent behaviors while striving for mutual prosperity.

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** All players cooperate (C) to maximize initial stock growth.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - Monitor the stock level after growth from the previous round.
  - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, continue cooperating (C).
  - If the stock drops below 50% of capacity, switch to defecting (D) for one round as a response to significant depletion. After defecting, revert to cooperation if the stock recovers above 60%.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a high initial stock.
- **Last Round:** If it's the final round, consider the current stock level:
  - Defect (D) if the stock is above 50% of capacity to maximize payoff without affecting future rounds.
  - Cooperate (C) if the stock is below 50% to prevent further depletion.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
- Encourage cooperation when the stock is healthy to maintain sustainability.
- Use temporary defection as a punitive measure against significant stock depletion, signaling the need for collective responsibility without triggering a race to defect.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability, adapting based on stock levels and including mechanisms to deter excessive depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_94 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT)

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C). This initializes the game with maximum stock to encourage sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - After observing the stock level from the previous round, apply the following rules:
     - If the stock level (S_t) is below 50% of the capacity, Cooperate (C) to help replenish the stock.
     - If the stock level is at or above 50% of the capacity, defect with a probability proportional to how much the stock exceeds this threshold. Specifically, the probability of defecting increases linearly from 0% at 50% capacity to 100% at full capacity.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Let \( S_t \) be the stock level after round t.
- The probability of defecting in round t+1 is:
  \[
  p(\text{Defect}) = \max(0, \min(1, \frac{S_t - 0.5 \times \text{capacity}}{\text{capacity}}))
  \]
  This means if \( S_t \) is exactly at 50% capacity, the probability of defecting is 0%; at full capacity, it's 100%.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **Last Round:** The strategy does not explicitly change for the last round. Players continue to follow the same rules based on the stock level, ensuring sustainability even in the final round.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is critically low (e.g., approaching zero), players will predominantly cooperate to prevent depletion.

**Rationale:**
This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability by encouraging cooperation when the stock is depleted and allowing controlled defection when the stock is abundant. It's adaptive, responding to the game's state without requiring communication or coordination, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Start with cooperation to establish a high initial stock level.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to defection if the stock falls below 75% of capacity to prioritize personal gain over resource sustainability.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize final payoff without concern for future rounds.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - Encourages cooperation when the resource is plentiful, promoting sustainability.
   - Adapts to resource depletion by defecting when necessary, ensuring individual payoffs are maximized when the stock is low.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

1. **Initial Rounds**:

2. **Monitoring Cooperation Levels**:
   - Track the number of players cooperating each round based on observed payoffs and stock changes.
   - Classify a player's action as Cooperate or Defect using the payoff structure.

3. **Adaptive Response**:
   - Calculate the cooperation rate (percentage of players who cooperated) in the previous round.
   - If cooperation rate is above 50%, continue Cooperating.
   - If below, switch to Defecting for the next two rounds as a punishment phase.

4. **Stock Management**:
   - Monitor the stock level after each round.
   - If stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), increase cooperation to facilitate regrowth.

5. **Final Rounds**:
   - In the last round, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without future consequences.

6. **Robustness and Forgiveness**:
   - After punishing for two rounds, reassess the cooperation rate.
   - If others return to Cooperating, resume Cooperative strategy.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, adapting based on collective behavior and stock health, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies while promoting sustainable resource use.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C). This action sets a cooperative tone, maximizing initial stock sustainability and encouraging others to follow suit.

   - If fewer than 75%, Defect (D) this round as a punitive measure.

3. **Last Round (r):**
   - Always Defect (D). Since there are no future consequences, defecting maximizes immediate payoff.

**Rationale:**
- **First Round Cooperation:** Encourages initial trust and maximizes stock sustainability.
- **75% Threshold:** Rewards substantial cooperation with continued cooperation, promoting a collective effort.
- **Stock Recovery:** Ensures that if the resource is depleted significantly, players work to replenish it, preventing long-term loss.
- **Last Round Defection:** Acknowledges the game's endgame scenario where immediate gain outweighs future consequences.

This strategy balances punishment for defection with incentives for cooperation, adapting to both social dynamics and environmental state.

**Explanation:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages a cooperative start, promoting stock sustainability.
- **Adaptive Punishment:** Defects temporarily when the stock is depleted to deter exploitation, then reverts if conditions improve.
- **Final Round Defection:** Maximizes payoff in the last round without affecting future stocks.

This strategy balances cooperation and punishment, adapting dynamically based on observed game state, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_100 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we can employ an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and stock levels. The strategy aims to maintain a healthy stock level while incentivizing cooperation through reciprocity.

### Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation (ARC)

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - All players cooperate (Action C) to establish a high initial stock level, promoting trust and setting the stage for sustained resource management.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r):**
   - **Monitor Previous Actions:**
     - Calculate the total consumption from the previous round.
     - Determine if the total consumption exceeds the expected amount under full cooperation (i.e., if any player defected).

   - **Decision Rules:**
     - If no defection was detected in the previous round and the stock level is above 75% of capacity, continue cooperating (Action C).
     - If defection was detected or the stock level drops below 50% of capacity, switch to defecting (Action D) for one round as a punitive measure.
     - After defecting once, revert to cooperation if the stock begins to recover (above 60% of capacity) and no recent defections are observed.

3. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above 75% of capacity without recent defections.
   - Cooperate with a probability proportional to the stock level relative to capacity if between 50% and 75%, considering past cooperation rates.
   - Defect if the stock falls below 50% of capacity or significant defection is detected.

4. **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
   - After a punitive defection, return to cooperation if subsequent rounds show improved stock levels and increased cooperation from other players.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the stock is near depletion (below 25% of capacity), prioritize immediate self-interest by defecting to maximize short-term gains.
   - If the stock remains consistently high (above 90% capacity) with persistent cooperation, continue cooperating indefinitely.

### Rationale:
- **Cooperation:** Sustains a healthy stock level, ensuring long-term resource availability and maximum collective payoff.
- **Reciprocal Punishment:** Deters defection by imposing immediate consequences on shared resources, encouraging others to revert to cooperative behavior.
- **Adaptive Thresholds:** Adjust actions dynamically based on observed behavior and environmental conditions (stock levels), enhancing robustness against varying strategic landscapes.

This strategy balances the need for cooperation with the temptation of short-term gains, fostering a resilient and adaptive approach to resource management in the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_101 = '''
To address the challenge of determining the optimal strategy for an AI in a repeated common pool resource game, we developed a straightforward yet effective approach. This strategy balances cooperation and defection based on observable conditions to maximize long-term payoffs while adapting to others' actions.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate to establish trust and maximize initial resource sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (except the last)**: 
   - Continue cooperating if the remaining stock after the previous round is above 50% of capacity. This threshold indicates that the resource is being managed sustainably.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to defection. Defection serves dual purposes: it signals disapproval of over-harvesting by others and allows the AI to secure more resources before potential depletion.
3. **Last Round**: Always defect to maximize immediate gain, as future consequences are irrelevant.

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages resource sustainability and mutual benefit.
- **Adaptive Threshold**: The 50% stock level serves as a clear indicator of whether the resource is being overused, prompting a strategic shift to defection.
- **Punishment Mechanism**: Defecting when the stock is low deters others from over-harvesting and ensures the AI isn't exploited.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last round, with no future consequences, defecting maximizes immediate payoff.

### Conclusion:
This strategy effectively balances cooperation and self-interest, adapting to environmental cues and others' actions to optimize outcomes in a dynamic game setting.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_102 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining the common resource sustainably while maximizing individual payoffs, we can implement a **threshold-based strategy**. This approach balances cooperation with punishment for overexploitation, ensuring the resource remains viable over time.

### Strategy:

1. **First Round**: All players Cooperate to establish maximum stock levels and promote initial cooperation.
   
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the stock after growth in the previous round was above 50% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
   - If the stock fell below 50% of capacity in the previous round, switch to Defecting as a punitive measure.

3. **Return to Cooperation**: After defecting once, return to Cooperate if the stock after growth in the last round recovered above 50% of capacity.

### Explanation:

- **Threshold at 50% Capacity**: This threshold serves as a clear indicator of whether the resource is being overexploited. Falling below this level signals that cooperation has broken down and punitive action (defection) is necessary to deter further exploitation.
  
- **Punishment Mechanism**: By defecting once when the stock drops below the threshold, players penalize those who may have defected previously, encouraging a return to cooperative behavior.
  
- ** Forgiveness**: After punishing, returning to cooperation allows the resource to recover and resets the strategy, promoting sustainability.

This approach is simple yet effective, leveraging observable state variables to guide decisions without requiring complex coordination or communication.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_103 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a robust collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining the sustainability of the common resource.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation (Round 1):**
   - All players start by Cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline and maintain the stock at its maximum capacity.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - After the first round, each player observes the stock level after growth.
   - If the stock level falls below 90% of the capacity, indicating significant depletion likely due to excessive defection, players switch to Defecting in the next round.
   - If the stock remains above or equal to 90%, players continue Cooperating.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., the final 10% of the game), all players switch to Defecting, as there are no future consequences for depletion in these rounds.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and avoids immediate resource depletion.
- **Adaptive Response:** Monitoring the stock level allows players to react to others' actions. Significant drops trigger a shift towards self-protection by defecting.
- **Endgame Rationality:** Defecting in final rounds is individually rational as it maximizes immediate payoffs without long-term repercussions.

### Implementation:

This strategy promotes sustainability while being responsive to opponents' behaviors, ensuring players are not exploited while also optimizing their payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_104 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed a strategic approach that balances cooperation with the need to maximize payoffs. The strategy is designed to be collective, adaptive, and robust against various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACST)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** All players Cooperate (C). This initiates the game with a focus on sustainability.
  
- **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
  - Each player observes the stock level after consumption in the previous round (S_remaining).
  - If S_remaining ≥ Capacity/2, the player Cooperates (C) to maintain stock health.
  - If S_remaining < Capacity/2, the player Defects (D) to secure higher immediate payoffs as the stock is depleted.

- **Last Round (r):** All players Defect (D). In the final round, with no future rounds to preserve the stock for, maximizing immediate payoff takes precedence.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- If the stock drops to zero or a very low level before the last round, players will defect in subsequent rounds since cooperation yields nothing.
- The strategy adapts dynamically based on observable state (stock levels), ensuring responsiveness without reliance on communication.

#### 3. Collective Alignment:
The ACST strategy is designed for all players to follow uniformly. It promotes initial cooperation to sustain resources but adaptively shifts to defection when stock health deteriorates, balancing individual and collective interests.

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to preserve the stock, ensuring future rounds have resources.
- **Adaptive Threshold:** Uses a clear, observable threshold (half of capacity) to decide actions, making it simple and fair.
- **Last Round Maximization:** Acknowledges game theory principles where immediate gains are prioritized in terminal stages.

This strategy is robust against various opponent strategies as it responds dynamically to the stock's state, ensuring players act in their best interest while considering collective sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_105 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable common resource over multiple rounds, we can design a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate to start with a high stock level.
2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, continue cooperating by taking S/(2n).
   - If the stock drops below 50%, switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoffs while allowing some regrowth.
3. **Last Round:** Defect to secure maximum possible gain since there are no future consequences.

### Rationale:
- **First Round Cooperation:** Establishes a high initial stock level, encouraging sustainability from the start.
- **Intermediate Rounds:** By cooperating when stock is healthy and defecting only when it's low, players balance their immediate interests with maintaining resource availability for future rounds.
- **Last Round Defection:** Maximizes personal gain in the final round without concern for future depletion.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** All players take S/(2n) in the first round to ensure minimal depletion and maximum regrowth.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels:** In subsequent rounds, assess if the stock is above or below 50% of capacity.
3. **Adjust Behavior Accordingly:** Cooperate when stock is sufficient; defect when it's low to secure higher payoffs while allowing some recovery.
4. **Final Round Action:** Everyone defects in the last round to maximize their share.

This strategy ensures that players act cooperatively to preserve the resource until it's crucial for immediate gain, striking a balance between individual and collective interests.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_106 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Conservation with Reciprocal Punishment (ACRP)**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and maintain stock levels.
- **Stock Conservation:** If the stock level in the previous round was below 50% of capacity, Cooperate to allow recovery.
- **Punish Defectors:** If the stock was above the threshold and more than half of the players defected last round, Defect this round as a response.
- **Default Cooperation:** In all other cases, Cooperate to maintain a sustainable stock level.

**2. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate trust and preserve the initial stock.
- **Last Rounds (e.g., last two rounds):** If the stock is above 50% of capacity, defect to maximize current payoff, balancing immediate gain with sustainability.
- **Stock Depletion Risk:** If stock drops near zero, prioritize cooperation to allow regeneration.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
All players follow these rules without communication, ensuring a unified approach that adapts to both the stock's state and others' past actions. This fosters cooperation while deterring excessive defection through reciprocal punishment.

This strategy balances sustainability with strategic responses to defections, promoting long-term payoffs while adapting to dynamic game conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_107 = '''
To balance maintaining a healthy stock level and discouraging defection among players, the strategy employs a straightforward approach:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C).

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the stock after growth from the previous round is below 50% of capacity, choose to Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, check if more than half of the players defected in the previous round. If so, Defect; else, Cooperate.

This strategy ensures that when the stock is low, all focus on rebuilding it. When the stock is healthy enough, players retaliate against significant defection to maintain cooperation incentives.

**Final Answer**: The optimal strategy alternates between cooperation and retaliation based on stock levels and past actions: Always cooperate first, rebuild when stock is low, and defect only when many defected previously while stock is sufficient. Thus, the answer is encapsulated in a balanced approach focusing on sustainability and reciprocity.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_108 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Forgiveness and Dynamic Thresholds**

This strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term stock sustainability through adaptive cooperation and reciprocal responses, incorporating elements of forgiveness to prevent cycles of retaliation.

### 1. **Sustainability Check**
- **Objective**: Ensure the stock can sustain all remaining rounds.
- **Calculation**: Estimate minimum required stock based on average consumption rates, adjusting for dynamic player actions.

### 2. **Dynamic Cooperation Threshold (p)**
- **Implementation**: Use a sliding scale where cooperation probability decreases smoothly as stock falls below capacity. This avoids abrupt changes and promotes consistent behavior.

### 3. **Reciprocity with Forgiveness**
- **Mechanism**: Punish defectors by defecting in the next round but include a forgiveness component to revert to cooperation if others start cooperating again, preventing endless retaliation cycles.

### 4. **Edge Cases Handling**
- **First Round**: Cooperate fully to encourage initial trust and set a positive tone.
- **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate gain, as future rounds don't exist.

### 5. **Adaptive Adjustments**
- **Stock Trends**: Use moving averages or trend analysis to inform cooperation probability adjustments.
- **Threshold Flexibility**: Dynamically adjust the cooperation threshold based on observed behavior and stock trends.

This strategy promotes sustainability, discourages exploitation through reciprocity, and adapts to changing conditions, enhancing robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_109 = '''
To design a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that is adaptive and robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors, we need to balance individual self-interest with collective sustainability. The strategy must be responsive to both the current state (stock level) and historical actions while maintaining alignment with the collective goal of preserving the resource over time.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Reciprocity with Stock Thresholds

#### 1. Decision Rules:
The strategy combines reciprocal behavior with stock-level thresholds to determine cooperation or defection. The key idea is to cooperate when others cooperate and defect when others defect, while also considering the health of the common pool.

- **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of other players' initial behavior.
  
- **Reciprocal Punishment with Forgiveness**:
  - Cooperate if at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round.
  - Defect if more than half defected in the previous round.
  
- **Stock-Level Adaptation**:
  - If the current stock is above a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), always cooperate to sustain the resource.
  - If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to defection to secure personal payoffs before the stock depletes further.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: All players cooperate to establish trust and observe others' initial actions.
- **Last Round**: In the final round, all players defect to maximize their individual payoff regardless of previous behavior.
- **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), all players defect to secure any remaining payoffs.

#### 3. Collective Alignment:
The strategy is designed with the collective mindset of resource preservation while allowing for adaptation based on others' actions and the current state of the stock. It balances cooperation to maintain the resource with defection to protect individual payoffs when necessary.

### Pseudocode Example:

```
function decide_action(current_stock, previous_actions, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"  # Initial cooperation
    
    num_coop_prev = count("C" in previous_actions)
    num_def_prev = count("D" in previous_actions)
    
    if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
        return "C"  # Sustain the resource when healthy
    elif current_stock < 0.25 * capacity:
        return "D"  # Secure payoffs when stock is critically low
    
    if num_coop_prev >= num_def_prev:
        return "C"  # Cooperate if majority cooperated last round
    else:
        return "D"  # Defect if majority defected last round
    
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return "D"  # Defect in the final round to maximize payoff
```

### Strategy Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Start with cooperation to encourage trust and observe others' behavior.
- **Reciprocal Punishment with Forgiveness**: Adjust actions based on the previous round's outcomes, promoting cooperation when others cooperate and defection when others defect.
- **Stock-Level Adaptation**: Use stock thresholds to switch strategies dynamically, ensuring resource sustainability while protecting individual payoffs during critical depletion phases.

This strategy is robust against a variety of opponent behaviors because it combines reciprocity with adaptive stock management. It aligns with the collective goal of preserving the common pool while allowing individuals to secure their payoffs when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_110 = '''
**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment and Forgiveness**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to initialize trust and maintain stock.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - Calculate the cooperation rate as the fraction of players who cooperated in the previous round.
     - If the cooperation rate is above 50%, cooperate.
     - If below, defect in the next round.
     - Additionally, if the stock drops below 50% of capacity, defect until it recovers above this threshold.
   - **Final Round:** Cooperate to maintain a sustainable end state.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to set a positive tone.
   - **Last Round:** Avoid defection to prevent stock depletion.
   - **Low Stock:** Prioritize stock recovery by defecting temporarily if the stock is critically low.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - Encourages cooperation when possible while protecting against exploitation.
   - Uses observable history to adapt, ensuring robustness without relying on others' strategies.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to others' actions and the game's state to maintain a healthy common pool.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_111 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose the **Adaptive Reciprocity Strategy (ARS)**. This strategy balances cooperation and defection dynamically based on game state, history, and remaining rounds.

### 1. Decision Rules:

- **Initial Cooperation (First Round):** Cooperate to establish trust and conserve the stock.
  
- **Stock Thresholds:**
  - If stock is above 75% of capacity, cooperate if most players cooperated last round; else defect.
  - If between 50% and 75%, cooperate only if at least half cooperated last round.
  - Below 50%, defect to maximize current payoff.

- **Reciprocity Mechanism:** Cooperate if a player cooperated in the previous round, otherwise defect.

- **Endgame Shift (Last 20% Rounds):** Increasingly favor defection as rounds progress to maximize short-term gains without jeopardizing future rounds excessively.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Unconditional cooperation to establish a cooperative norm.
  
- **Low Stock Situations:** Prioritize stock conservation through cooperation if stock is critically low, ensuring resource availability for future rounds.

- **Last Round:** All players defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.

### 3. Collective Alignment:

The strategy promotes collective welfare by encouraging initial and sustained cooperation while adapting to others' actions to prevent exploitation. It uses reciprocity to maintain fairness and adjusts behavior based on the game's progression to balance individual and collective payoffs.

This approach ensures that players act in their self-interest while contributing to the sustainability of the common resource, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_112 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C). All players start by cooperating to establish a cooperative baseline and maximize initial stock sustainability.

- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Monitor the remaining stock level after each round's consumption, denoted as \( S_{\text{prev}} \).
  - **Threshold Check:** If \( S_{\text{prev}} > \frac{\text{capacity}}{2} \), Cooperate (C) in the current round.
  - **Punishment Mechanism:** If \( S_{\text{prev}} \leq \frac{\text{capacity}}{2} \), Defect (D) for the next 3 rounds to punish overexploitation.

- **Recovery Phase:**
  - After defecting for 3 consecutive rounds, reassess the stock level.
  - If \( S_{\text{prev}} > \frac{\text{capacity}}{2} \), switch back to Cooperate (C).
  - If not recovered, continue Defecting until recovery.

**2. Edge Cases:**

- **Last Round:** In the final round, all players should Cooperate to maximize immediate payoffs without future consequences.
  
- **Stock Recovery:** After a punishment phase, if the stock recovers above the threshold, immediately revert to cooperation to sustain the resource for future rounds.

**3. Pseudocode Implementation:**

```pseudocode
function strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        S_prev = get_stock_level(history)
        threshold = capacity / 2
        punishment_rounds = 0
        
        if S_prev > threshold and not in_punishment:
            return Cooperate
        elif S_prev <= threshold:
            start_punishment = true
            punishment_rounds = 3
        else if in_punishment:
            punishment_rounds -= 1
            if punishment_rounds == 0:
                check_recovery = true
                if S_prev > threshold:

            return Defect
        
    # Last round handling
    if current_round == r:
        return Cooperate

```

**4. Strategy Overview:**

This strategy promotes sustained cooperation by punishing periods of overexploitation, ensuring that players maintain a healthy stock level. It incentivizes cooperation through the threat of mutual punishment when the resource is depleted beyond a threshold. The approach balances individual payoffs with collective sustainability, fostering a robust and adaptive behavior suitable for repeated interaction scenarios.

**5. Collective Mindset:**

The strategy aligns all players to cooperate unless the stock significantly depletes, triggering a brief period of defection as punishment. This ensures that any deviation from cooperation is met with a response that restores balance, promoting long-term resource sustainability and maximizing collective payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_113 = '''
To address the challenge of managing the common resource effectively, each player should adopt the following strategy:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C). This ensures the stock remains at capacity after growth.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock level \( S \) is greater than 50% of the capacity \( C \), continue to Cooperate (C).
   - If the current stock level \( S \) drops to 50% or below, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

This strategy balances maintaining the stock when it's healthy and maximizing individual gains when it's depleted. While it risks further depletion once \( S \) is below 50%, it provides a clear, deterministic approach without requiring coordination among players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_114 = '''
**Strategy: Sustainable Cooperation with Gradual Punishment (SCGP)**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate to establish trust and observe others' behavior.
   - **Monitoring Compliance**: After each round, check if the stock is above 75% of capacity and if at least half the players cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Punishment Phase**: If stock drops below threshold or insufficient cooperation, defect for one round as punishment. Resume cooperation unless issues persist.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to build trust.
   - **Last Rounds**: Cooperate if stock is sufficient; otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Collective Alignment**: Encourages sustained cooperation by balancing punishment with recovery opportunities, preventing resource depletion and fostering a stable environment for all players.

**Simulation Example (n=2, r=3, capacity=100)**:

- **Round 1**: Both cooperate, stock remains at 100.
- **Round 2**: If one defects, stock drops to 62.5. Punishment triggers both defecting in Round 3.
- **Round 3**: Stock depletes, leading to zero payoff for all.

This strategy aims to maintain resource sustainability while adaptively responding to cooperation levels, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_115 = '''
**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initialization**: 
   - All players start by Cooperating in the first round to maximize initial payoffs and maintain a high stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (from Round 2 to Round r-1)**:
   - **Check Current Stock Level**: Determine if the current stock is below a critical low threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity).
     - If `current_stock < critical_low_level`, choose to Cooperate. This ensures that when the stock is critically low, all players work together to allow recovery.
   - **Evaluate Past Behavior**: Count how many players defected in the previous round (`prev_defectors`).
     - If `prev_defectors > threshold_defectors` (e.g., 25% of total players), choose to Defect. This punishes past over-exploitation and deters future defection.
   - **Default Cooperation**: If neither condition above is met, Cooperate to maintain the stock level and encourage mutual benefit.

3. **Final Round (Round r)**:
   - Since there are no subsequent rounds for growth or punishment, players face a temptation to defect to maximize immediate gain. However, defecting can lead to stock depletion, reducing payoffs.
   - To address this, in the final round, players should Cooperate if the current stock is sufficient (e.g., above 50% of capacity) to ensure a higher collective payoff. If the stock is already low, they may still choose to Cooperate to allow for any possible recovery, though it's less critical as there are no future rounds.

**Algorithm Summary:**

    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        prev_defectors = previous_defectors
        
        if current_stock < critical_low_level:
            action = 'Cooperate'
        elif prev_defectors > threshold_defectors:
            action = 'Defect'
        else:
            action = 'Cooperate'
            
        # Update for next round
        previous_defectors = count_defectors_in_current_round()
        
    execute_action(action)
```

**Conclusion:**

This strategy balances between maintaining stock levels and reciprocally punishing past defections, encouraging cooperation while safeguarding against over-exploitation. It handles edge cases like the first and last rounds by prioritizing stock recovery and considering the absence of future consequences in the final round.

To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation among players to sustainably manage a shared resource, we can design a strategy based on the resource's stock level. Here's how it works:

**Strategy:**
1. **First Round:** All players Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** Each player will Cooperate if the stock level in the previous round was above 50% of its initial capacity; otherwise, they will Defect.

This approach uses the resource's abundance as a signal to guide cooperation or defection, aiming to balance individual gain with collective sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_117 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Last Round Defection**

1. **First Round Action**: 
   - Cooperate (C). This initializes trust and maintains the stock at its maximum level, setting a positive tone for future rounds.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Stock Check**: If the current stock is below 25% of capacity, cooperate to allow recovery.
   - **Defection Threshold**: Count the number of players who defected in the previous round. If this number exceeds half of n (rounded up), defect in the current round. Otherwise, cooperate.

3. **Last Round Action (Round r)**:
   - Always Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds, maximize immediate payoff without concern for stock sustainability beyond the final round.

**Pseudocode Representation**:

```
def strategy(current_round, total_rounds, previous_actions, current_stock, capacity, n):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
        if current_stock < stock_threshold:
            return "C"
        else:
            previous_defections = sum(1 for action in previous_actions[-1] if action == "D")
            threshold = (n // 2) + 1
            if previous_defections >= threshold:
                return "D"
            else:
                return "C"
```

This strategy promotes cooperation to sustain the resource while allowing for adaptive responses to others' defections and ensuring stock recovery. It balances collective welfare with individual maximization, particularly in the final round where immediate gain is prioritized.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_118 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Cooperation (ACC)**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish trust and observe initial behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (until last round):**
   - **Stock Level Check:** If the stock is above 75% of capacity, continue cooperating.
   - **Defection Threshold:** If more than half of players defected in the previous round or if the stock falls below 50%, defect this round as a punitive measure.

3. **Post-Punishment Round:**
   - After defecting once, return to cooperation unless the conditions for defection still apply (stock too low or excessive defections).

4. **Last Round Handling:**
   - In the final round, decide based on current stock:
     - If stock is above 75%, cooperate.
     - If stock is below 50%, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

This strategy balances cooperation with necessary punitive actions to maintain a sustainable resource level while considering edge cases like the last round.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy balances cooperation and punishment to sustain the common pool while maximizing individual payoffs. It's adaptive, considering past actions and current stock levels.

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and observe others' behavior.

2. **Punishment Mechanism**: If more than 50% of players Defected in the previous round, switch to Defecting (D) for one round as punishment to deter future defection.

3. **Sustainability Check**: Before each decision, if the stock is below half capacity, Cooperate to allow recovery and prevent depletion.

4. **Adaptive Cooperation**: Monitor recent history (last 2-3 rounds). If most players Cooperated, continue cooperating; otherwise, Defect to protect your payoff.

5. **Final Round Handling**: In the last round, maintain cooperation unless the stock is critically low, ensuring sustainable use even in the endgame.

This strategy encourages cooperation by penalizing excessive defection while allowing recovery and adapting to others' actions, aiming to maintain a healthy stock level for continued benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_120 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game challenge, we've designed an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with the need to prevent stock depletion. This approach ensures sustainability while being robust against various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating to establish a high initial stock level.
2. **Adaptive Threshold Response**: In subsequent rounds, each player monitors the current stock level. If it remains above a defined threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), they continue to cooperate. Should the stock drop below this threshold, indicating potential over-depletion, players switch to defecting for one round.
3. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After defecting, if the stock shows signs of recovery, players revert to cooperation. This prevents perpetual defection and encourages stock replenishment.
4. **Last Round Consideration**: Even in the final round, players maintain cooperation to avoid unnecessary depletion, promoting trust throughout the game.

This strategy is responsive to the game's state and history, ensuring collective sustainability without relying on prearranged coordination.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_121 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and punishment while maintaining resource sustainability. The strategy incorporates reciprocity based on others' past actions and adjusts according to the current stock level.

### Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Stock Threshold (ARST)

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone and builds trust.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     1. **Reciprocal Action:** Observe the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than half defected, choose to Defect (D) this round as a form of punishment. Otherwise, Cooperate (C).
     2. **Stock-Based Adjustment:** Regardless of others' actions, if the current stock is below a predefined threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to Cooperation (C) to allow stock recovery.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate without exception.
   - **Last Round:** Continue with the same strategy based on previous round actions and stock level, promoting consistency even in the final round.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize sustainability by forcing Cooperation when stock is critically low.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy encourages cooperation unless there's significant defection or critical resource depletion, aligning with a collective mindset focused on long-term sustainability and mutual benefit.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_reciprocity_stock_threshold(n, capacity, r):
    current_strategy = []
    previous_actions = []
    stock = capacity
    low_threshold = 0.2 * capacity
    
    for round in range(r):
        if round == 0:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            count_defectors = previous_actions.count('D')
            
            # Check if more than half defected last round
            if count_defectors > n / 2:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'
            
            # Check stock level after last round's growth
            if stock < low_threshold:
                action = 'C'
        
        current_strategy.append(action)
        previous_actions.append(action)
        
        # Simulate payoff and stock update (simplified)
        total_consumption = 0
        for a in current_strategy[round]:
            if a == 'C':
                consumption = stock / (2 * n)
            else:
                consumption = stock / n
            total_consumption += consumption
        
        S_remaining = max(0, stock - total_consumption)
        growth = 2 * S_remaining * (1 - S_remaining / capacity)
        stock = min(S_remaining + growth, capacity)
    
    return current_strategy

# Example usage:
n = 4
capacity = 100
r = 10
strategy = adaptive_reciprocity_stock_threshold(n, capacity, r)
print(strategy)
```

This strategy aims to maintain a balance between individual payoff and collective resource sustainability through reciprocal actions and stock-sensitive decisions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_122 = '''
**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a high stock level, encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Ongoing Strategy:**
   - **Threshold Check:** Evaluate if the current stock is above 70% of capacity.
     - **If Above 70%:**
       - Cooperate (C) if the majority of players cooperated in previous rounds.
       - Defect (D) if a significant number defected previously, to avoid being exploited.
     - **If Below 70%:**
       - A portion of players defect as punishment. The number defecting is proportional to the deviation from the threshold and past defections.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - **Trigger:** Stock drops below 70% capacity or a significant number of players defected.
   - **Execution:** Calculate the number of players to defect based on the average cooperation rate. This balanced approach aims to punish without over-depleting the stock.

4. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Maintain a healthy stock for future interactions, even if not directly benefiting, promoting a collective good mindset.

5. **Adaptation and Robustness:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level and players' past actions.
   - Adjust cooperation based on observed behavior to maintain a sustainable balance between individual gain and collective resource management.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation while adaptively responding to defections to prevent stock depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_123 = '''
**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Retaliation**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and maintain a high initial stock level.
   - **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
     - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, cooperate to help replenish the stock.
     - If the stock is above 50%, check the number of defectors from the previous round. If more than 20% defected, defect in retaliation; otherwise, continue cooperating.
   - **Last Round (Round r)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Low Stock**: When the stock drops below 50% of capacity, prioritize cooperation to facilitate recovery.
   - **Recent Defections**: If a significant number of players (more than 20%) defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to punish such behavior and encourage future cooperation.

3. **Collective Alignment**:
   - The strategy promotes a balance between maintaining the resource for future use and retaliating against recent defections to discourage exploitation.
   - It encourages cooperation when conditions are favorable but adapts to protect individual payoffs when others defect excessively.

This approach ensures that players act in their collective interest by preserving the stock while also being robust against defectors, fostering a sustainable balance over multiple rounds.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a sustainable stock level from the beginning.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - Observe the stock level after growth in the previous round.
     - If the stock is below 50% of the capacity, switch to Defect (D) for the current round.
     - If the stock is at or above 50%, continue Cooperating (C).
   - **Rationale:** Maintain cooperation unless the stock significantly depletes, indicating potential widespread defection.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If the current stock level is above 25% of capacity, choose Cooperate (C).
     - If the stock is 25% or below, switch to Defect (D).
   - **Rationale:** In the last round, prioritize immediate payoff if the stock is low, while still considering cooperation if the stock remains sufficiently high.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function decide_action(n, r, capacity, current_stock, round, history):
    if round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    else if round < r:
        prev_stock = history[round-2].stock_after_growth
        threshold = capacity / 2
        if prev_stock < threshold:
            return "Defect"
        else:
            return "Cooperate"
    else: # Last round
        lower_threshold = capacity / 4
        if current_stock > lower_threshold:
            return "Cooperate"

class Strategy:

        self.history.append({"round": round, "stock_after_growth": current_stock})
        return action
```

**Summary:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating to maintain a high stock level.
- **Adaptive Response:** Switch to defecting if the stock falls below 50% of capacity in previous rounds, aiming to prevent over-depletion.
- **Final Round Adjustment:** Cooperate if possible in the last round, but defect if the stock is too low to ensure maximum immediate payoff.

This strategy balances collective cooperation with adaptive responses to maintain sustainability and adapt to potential defections.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_125 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring long-term sustainability of the resource while maximizing individual payoffs. The strategy incorporates elements of reciprocity, stock level monitoring, and punishment mechanisms to maintain a healthy stock level.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first round, all players cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial resource utilization without overexploitation.

2. **Stock Threshold Monitoring**:
   - Define a threshold at 50% of the capacity (capacity/2). Players monitor the stock level after each round.
   - If the stock is above this threshold, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to defection to prevent further depletion.

3. **Reciprocal Punishment Mechanism**:
   - Observe the number of defectors in the previous round. Calculate the proportion of players who defected.
   - If more than half of the players defected in the last round, switch to defection for one round as a form of punishment to deter overexploitation.

4. **Forgiveness and Re-cooperation**:
   - After defecting as punishment, if the stock level begins to recover (exceeds 50% capacity) and fewer than half the players defected in the subsequent rounds, revert to cooperation.
   - This allows the resource time to regenerate and encourages others to return to cooperative behavior.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - Continuously monitor the rate of stock depletion relative to its growth. If consumption outpaces growth significantly, adjust the threshold or punishment duration to maintain balance.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def strategy(player_id, n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history)
    
    if current_round == 0:
        return "C"  # Initial Cooperation
    
    previous_stock = history[-1]['stock_after']
    previous_actions = [action for action in history[-1]['actions']]
    
    defectors_last_round = sum(1 for a in previous_actions if a == 'D')
    proportion_defectors = defectors_last_round / n
    
    if current_round < r:
        # Check stock threshold
        if previous_stock > capacity / 2 and proportion_defectors <= 0.5:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
    
    # Last round (if needed)
    if current_round == r - 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate to end on a sustainable note
    
    # Forgiveness after punishment
    if proportion_defectors > 0.5 and previous_stock < capacity / 2:
        return "D"
    
    return "C"

```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to set a positive tone and avoid immediate resource depletion.
- **Stock Threshold**: Ensures that cooperation continues only when the stock is healthy, preventing overexploitation.
- **Reciprocal Punishment**: Deters excessive defection by switching strategies when many players defect, maintaining fairness.
- **Forgiveness Mechanism**: Allows for recovery of both the stock and cooperative behavior, encouraging sustainable use.

This strategy aims to balance individual gains with collective resource management, ensuring the common pool remains viable across all rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_126 = '''
To address the strategic considerations of the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with targeted punishment while prioritizing stock replenishment when necessary.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate
   - Start by cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial collective payoff without depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t=2 to r-1)**
   a. **Stock Health Check**: If the current stock after growth is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate to allow recovery.
   b. **Punishment Mechanism**: 
      - Monitor the number of players who defected in the previous round.
      - If more than 25% of players defected, defect in the current round as a punitive measure.
   c. **Default Cooperation**: If neither stock health nor significant defection is an issue, continue cooperating.

3. **Last Round (t=r) Action**: Defect
   - In the final round, defect to maximize personal payoff since there are no future consequences or rounds to consider.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```
def adaptive_cooperation_punishment(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_stock = history[-1].stock_after_growth if history else capacity
    if len(history) == 0:
        return "C"  # First round
    
    t = len(history) + 1
    if t == r:
        return "D"  # Last round
    
    if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
        return "C"  # Replenish stock
    
    prev_actions = history[-1].actions
    defectors = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == "D")
    
    if (defectors / n) > 0.25:
        return "D"  # Punish defectors
    else:
        return "C"  # Cooperate

# Example usage:
# history is a list of previous rounds, each containing stock_after_growth and actions.
```

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation**: Sets a cooperative tone, encouraging mutual benefit from the outset.
- **Stock Prioritization**: Ensures that when the resource is scarce, conservation is prioritized to prevent depletion.
- **Punishment for Defection**: Deters excessive defection by imposing a penalty in subsequent rounds, maintaining the incentive to cooperate.
- **Final Round Defection**: Maximizes personal gain in the last round without future repercussions.

This strategy is designed to adapt dynamically based on both the game's state and the actions of other players, promoting sustainability while being robust against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_127 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin with cooperation in the first round to establish trust and observe other players' behavior.

2. **Monitor and Adapt**:
   - Track the average cooperation rate (H) of all players over recent rounds.
   - Assess the current stock level (S) relative to capacity.

3. **Decision Rules**:
   - If S is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), cooperate to aid replenishment.
   - If H exceeds a high cooperation threshold (e.g., 70%) and S is above a mid-level threshold (e.g., 50%), continue cooperating.
   - Otherwise, defect with a probability proportional to the level of past defections, ensuring some cooperation continues.

4. **Stock Consideration**:
   - Prioritize stock health by cooperating when necessary to prevent depletion below sustainable levels.
   - Allow controlled defection when the stock is robust enough to handle it without significant long-term impact.

5. **Final Rounds Adjustment**:
   - In the last few rounds, if the stock is sufficiently healthy, maintain cooperation; otherwise, defect judiciously to maximize immediate payoffs while considering future sustainability.

This strategy balances individual gains with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and adapting as needed based on others' actions and resource health.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_128 = '''
**Strategy: Sustainable Cooperation with Punishment (SCoP)**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first round, all players cooperate by choosing action C.

2. **Sustained Cooperation through Monitoring**:
   - Players continue to cooperate (action C) if the current stock level is above 70% of the capacity.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, players switch to defecting (action D) to conserve resources and punish defectors.

3. **Gradual Escalation of Punishment**:
   - When a player detects that the stock has dropped below the 70% threshold due to suspected defection, they defect for up to three rounds.
   - After the punishment phase, if the stock recovers above 50% of capacity, players revert to cooperation.

4. **Stock Recovery Mechanism**:
   - If the stock falls below 50%, players continue to defect until the stock begins to recover, indicating successful punishment and a return to potential cooperation.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: All players cooperate.
   - **Last Round**: Players follow the same strategy to avoid endgame exploitation, maintaining fairness.
   - **Stock Near Zero**: If the stock reaches zero, all future rounds result in zero payoff, encouraging strategies that prevent depletion.

6. **Robustness and Adaptation**:
   - The strategy adapts based on observed stock levels and past actions, ensuring flexibility against various opponent behaviors without requiring communication.

7. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - The cooperation threshold may adjust dynamically based on historical stock levels to balance punishment with resource sustainability.

This approach aims to maintain a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability, using cooperative behavior incentivized by mutual benefits and enforced through calibrated punishment.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_129 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we can employ an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observed trends in the stock level. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Based Thresholds (ACS)

1. **First Round Action:**
   - **Cooperate:** All players start by cooperating to maximize initial stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track the current and previous rounds' stock levels to assess depletion trends.
   - **Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
     - **High Stock (Above 75% of Capacity):** Continue cooperation to maintain a healthy stock level.
     - **Moderate Stock (Between 50% and 75%):** Cooperate, but be vigilant. If the stock shows a declining trend over two consecutive rounds, consider defecting in the next round to prevent further depletion.
     - **Low Stock (Below 50%):** Temporarily switch to defection to maximize individual payoffs while the stock is still recoverable.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - If the stock level drops significantly (e.g., below a critical threshold), players should defect for one round as a punitive measure to deter excessive exploitation.

4. **Last Round Consideration:**
   - In the final round, prioritize maximizing individual payoff by defecting if the stock is sufficiently depleted. However, if the stock remains healthy, consider cooperation to end on a sustainable note.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy based on stock trends and adjust thresholds as necessary to maintain balance between cooperation and defection.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_stock_based_thresholds(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, previous_stock, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        # Calculate the percentage of remaining stock relative to capacity
        stock_percent = (current_stock / capacity) * 100
        
        # Determine thresholds
        high_threshold = 75
        moderate_threshold = 50
        
        # Check for significant depletion in previous rounds
        recent_depletion = previous_stock - current_stock
        
        if stock_percent > high_threshold:
            return "Cooperate"
        elif (stock_percent <= high_threshold and stock_percent > moderate_threshold):
            # Check trend over last two rounds for decline
            if is_declining_trend():
                return "Defect"
            else:
                return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Defect"

def is_declining_trend(stock_history, window=2):
    # Implement logic to check if stock has been declining over the past 'window' rounds
    pass
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and maintains high initial stock levels.
- **Stock Monitoring:** By tracking stock levels, players can make informed decisions about when to switch strategies.
- **Thresholds:** The use of thresholds (75% and 50%) allows the strategy to adapt dynamically based on the stock's health.
- **Punishment:** Temporary defection serves as a deterrent against exploitation, promoting a balance that encourages others to cooperate.
- **Final Round Strategy:** Maximizing payoff in the last round while considering stock sustainability ensures both individual gain and environmental health.

This strategy aims to foster cooperation while protecting against overexploitation, ensuring long-term sustainability of the common resource.

To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a straightforward yet adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observable game state. This strategy aims to sustain the common pool while ensuring individual payoffs remain robust against various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Based Threshold

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round. This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes the likelihood of maintaining the stock at its initial capacity, ensuring high payoffs for all players from the outset.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Cooperate if the previous round's stock level was above 50% of the game's capacity**.
     - By cooperating when the stock is plentiful, players contribute to sustaining a healthy resource level, which supports long-term payoffs.
   - **Defect (D) if the previous round's stock level fell below 50% of capacity**.
     - Defecting when the stock is low helps prevent further depletion and incentivizes others to return to cooperative behavior, as continued defection would harm everyone's future payoffs.

3. **Monitoring and Adaptation**:
   - After defecting in a round, monitor the stock level in subsequent rounds.
   - If the stock begins to recover (i.e., increases towards or exceeds 50% of capacity), switch back to cooperating.
   - This adaptive element encourages a return to cooperation once the resource is on a sustainable path.

### Rationale

- **Sustainability**: Cooperating when the stock is above 50% ensures that the common pool can sustain itself over multiple rounds, preventing depletion and maintaining high payoffs for all players.
- **Punishment Mechanism**: Defecting when the stock drops below 50% serves as a deterrent against excessive exploitation. It signals to other players that cooperation is necessary to avoid resource depletion.
- **Flexibility**: The strategy adapts based on the game's state, allowing it to respond dynamically to changes in the stock level and other players' actions without requiring explicit communication.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **Last Round**: In the final round, the strategy follows the same rules. If the stock is above 50%, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This ensures consistency throughout the game.
- **Extreme Stock Levels**: If the stock reaches zero in any round, all subsequent actions will be to defect since there's nothing left to conserve.

### Conclusion

This adaptive strategy promotes cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation, aligning individual incentives with collective sustainability. By leveraging observable game states and a simple threshold, it remains robust across diverse opponent strategies and game parameters.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative foundation and maintain a high initial stock level.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - Calculate the cooperation rate as the number of players who cooperated in the previous round divided by the total number of players.
     - If the cooperation rate is above 50%, continue cooperating. If below, switch to defecting to respond to prevalent defection.
     - Monitor the stock level. If it falls below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), prioritize cooperation to allow regeneration, regardless of others' actions.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Cooperate to ensure a stable payoff and prevent stock depletion, even if tempted by short-term gains.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is critically low, cooperate to facilitate recovery, ensuring future rounds have a sustainable resource base.

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   - The strategy focuses on sustaining the common pool for long-term benefit, balancing immediate payoffs with future resource availability. It encourages cooperation unless defection becomes widespread, then adapts to discourage further depletion.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
function decide_action(stock, history, round, capacity):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        prev_actions = history[-1]
        coop_rate = count_C(prev_actions) / n
        if stock < 0.25 * capacity:
            return "C"
        elif coop_rate >= 0.5:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"

function main():
    for each round from 1 to r:
        current_stock = get_stock()
        if round == r:
            action = "C"
        else:
            history = get_history()
            action = decide_action(current_stock, history, round)
        take_action(action)
```

This strategy adaptively responds to both the stock level and collective behavior, aiming to maintain a sustainable resource for all players while being robust against varying opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Design: Sustainable Cooperation with Adaptive Defection (SCAD)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) unconditionally to initiate trust and observe others' behavior.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - **Cooperate (C)** if both the stock is above 70% of capacity, and at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round.
  - **Defect (D)** if either the stock falls below 30%, or fewer than half of the players cooperated previously.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there’s no future impact.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline and gather information on others' strategies.
- **Low Stock (near 0):** Switch to Defect immediately as cooperation yields minimal benefits.
- **Last Round:** Prioritize immediate gain by defecting, regardless of prior actions.

#### 3. Collective Alignment:
The strategy promotes initial cooperation to sustain the resource, adapting based on collective behavior and stock levels. It incentivizes sustained cooperation but allows for defection when necessary to protect individual payoffs.

**Pseudocode:**

```
def scad_strategy(game_state):
    if game_state['round'] == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        previous_cooperations = count_of_C_in_previous_round()
        stock_level = game_state['stock']
        capacity = game_state['capacity']

        # Determine thresholds
        high_stock_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
        low_stock_threshold = 0.3 * capacity

        if stock_level >= high_stock_threshold and previous_cooperations >= (n / 2):
            return 'C'
        elif stock_level <= low_stock_threshold or previous_cooperations < (n / 2):
            return 'D'

    # Last round handling
    if game_state['round'] == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy balances cooperation with the necessity to adapt, ensuring sustainability while protecting individual interests against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_133 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The proposed strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection dynamically, adapting based on past player behavior and current stock levels while addressing edge cases such as the first and last rounds.

### Strategy Overview

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and maintain the stock level.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate from all previous rounds.
   - If the stock level falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to Cooperation to allow recovery.
   - Cooperate if the historical cooperation rate exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., 70%). Otherwise, Defect.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate personal gain, as future consequences are irrelevant.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```pseudocode
Parameters:
    n: number of players
    r: number of rounds
    capacity: maximum stock level
    critical_stock = 0.5 * capacity
    coop_threshold = 0.7

Initialize:
    current_stock = capacity
    cooperation_history = []

For each round from 1 to r:
    if round == 1:
        action = C
    elif round == r:
        action = D
    else:
        average_coop_rate = (sum(cooperation_history) / (n * (round - 1)))
        if current_stock < critical_stock or average_coop_rate > coop_threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D

    cooperation_history.append(action == C ? 1 : 0)
    # Update current_stock based on all players' actions and stock dynamics rules
```

### Explanation

- **First Round:** Starts with cooperation to maintain a high initial stock level.
- **Intermediate Rounds:** Adapts strategy by evaluating both historical cooperation rates and current stock levels. This ensures that if the stock is at risk, cooperation is prioritized for sustainability.
- **Last Round:** Defects to maximize personal payoff without concern for future repercussions.

This approach is robust, adaptive, and aligns with a collective mindset aimed at sustainable resource management while allowing for strategic self-interest in the endgame.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_134 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players cooperate (C). This sets a foundation for potential sustained cooperation and maximum stock growth.

2. **Stock and Cooperation Monitoring**: From the second round onwards, each player monitors two key factors:
   - The current stock level at the beginning of the round.
   - The number of defectors in the previous round.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - **Stock Threshold**: If the stock is above 70% of the game's capacity, it indicates a healthy state conducive to cooperation.
   - **Cooperation Threshold**: If fewer than 30% of players defected in the previous round, it suggests sufficient cooperation.

4. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate** if both conditions are met: stock is above 70% and fewer than 30% defected last round.
   - **Defect** if either condition isn't met to protect individual payoffs and encourage others to return to cooperation.

5. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: If after defecting, the stock recovers above 70% and defection rates drop below 30%, players revert to cooperating, allowing renewal of mutual cooperation.

6. **Final Rounds Consideration**: Even in the last round, players adhere to the strategy, cooperating if conditions are met, to preserve stock health as much as possible for the final outcome.

**Pseudocode Implementation**:

```
def collective_strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    defectors_last_round = sum(1 for action in history[-1]['actions'] if action == 'D')

    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    stock_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    cooperation_threshold = 0.3 * n

    if current_stock > stock_threshold and defectors_last_round < cooperation_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage in a game loop:
history = []
for round in range(r):
    actions = [collective_strategy(n, r, capacity, history) for _ in range(n)]
    # Simulate the round and update history
    history.append({
        'round': round + 1,
        'stock': updated_stock,
        'actions': actions
    })
```

This strategy balances reciprocity with self-interest, encouraging sustained cooperation while protecting against excessive exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_135 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can adopt an approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on the game's state and history. Here is the structured strategy:

### Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Sustainability Thresholds

1. **First Round Action:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** Start by cooperating to encourage a cooperative environment from the beginning.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision-Making:**
   - **Stock Level Assessment:** Evaluate the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If the stock is above 50% of capacity and there are more than 2 rounds remaining, continue Cooperating (C).
     - If the stock falls below 50% of capacity or only 1-2 rounds remain, switch to Defecting (D) to secure individual gains before potential depletion.

3. **Tit-for-Tat Mechanism:**
   - Monitor the average actions of other players.
     - Cooperate if most players are cooperating.
     - Defect if a significant number of players are defecting to avoid exploitation.

4. **Final Rounds Strategy:**
   - In the last round, always Defect (D) since there is no future stock to preserve.

5. **Sustainability Thresholds:**
   - Use predefined thresholds (e.g., 50% capacity) as triggers for switching strategies.
   - Adjust consumption rates dynamically based on observed cooperation levels and remaining rounds.

This strategy aims to maintain resource sustainability while adapting to the actions of others, ensuring both collective and individual payoffs are optimized over the game's duration.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_136 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - All players Cooperate (C) to initiate the game with maximum stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Previous Round:** Track the number of Defectors and the resulting stock level after growth.
   - **Threshold Check:** 
     - If the stock is above 50% of capacity and fewer than 25% of players Defected, continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock drops below 50% or more than 25% Defected, switch to Defecting for one round as a punitive measure.

3. **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
   - After punishing by Defecting, return to Cooperation in subsequent rounds if stock levels recover above the threshold and fewer players are defecting.

4. **Last Round Handling:**
   - In the final round, all players Cooperate to prevent stock depletion, ensuring a sustainable end to the game.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by using reciprocity and forgiveness, encouraging cooperation while deterring free-riding.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_137 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - All players start by Cooperating (C) to establish trust and maximize initial stock sustainability.

2. **Adaptive Response Based on History:**
   - In each subsequent round, count the number of players who Defected in the previous round.
   - If fewer than 50% defected, continue Cooperating.
   - If 50% or more defected, switch to Defecting to protect individual payoffs.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - Check the current stock level after each round.
   - If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), all players Cooperate for the next round to allow stock regrowth.

4. **Endgame Strategy (Last Round):**
   - In the final round, all players Defect to maximize immediate personal gain since there are no future consequences.

5. **Robustness and Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy is designed to be followed by all players without prior communication.
   - It adapts based on collective past actions, ensuring a balance between cooperation and self-interest.

This strategy aims to sustain the common pool while adapting to others' behaviors, ensuring long-term payoffs through cooperation and protecting against excessive depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_138 = '''
### Strategy: Adaptive Collective Cooperation (ACC)

#### 1. Decision Rules:

- **Initial Rounds (Round 1):**
  - Cooperate unconditionally to initiate cooperation and maximize initial stock growth.

- **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
  - **If the stock is above a sustainability threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity):** Cooperate.
  - **If the stock is below the threshold:** Defect once, then return to cooperation in subsequent rounds if others reciprocate.

- **Final Rounds (Round r):**
  - Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Start with Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Round:** Switch to Defect to maximize personal gain without future repercussions.
- **Stock Depletion Crisis:** If stock drops critically low (e.g., below 30% of capacity), prioritize stock recovery by Cooperating for a few rounds.

#### 3. Collective Alignment:

The strategy encourages cooperation when the group's actions maintain a healthy stock level, promoting long-term sustainability. It adapts to others' behaviors by reciprocating cooperation and temporarily defecting only when necessary, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies.

### Pseudocode Example:

```
function adaptive_collective_cooperation(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    round = get_round_number()

    if round == 1:
        action = "C"
    elif round == r:
        action = "D"
    else:
        sustainability_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
        if current_stock > sustainability_threshold:
            action = "C"
        else:
            # Check history to see if others cooperated last round
            last_round_cooperations = count_of_C_in_last_round(history)
            if last_round_cooperations >= n/2:
                action = "C"
            else:
                action = "D"

    return action
```

This strategy balances cooperation and self-interest, adapting based on the stock's health and others' past actions to maintain a sustainable collective resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_139 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action**: All players Cooperate (C). This ensures the stock remains at maximum capacity, promoting sustainability from the start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Stock Check**: If the stock level falls below half of the capacity, all players Defect (D) in the next round to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Defection Monitoring**: Count the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than half defected, switch to Defect; otherwise, continue Cooperating.

3. **Last Round Action**: All players Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds, maximizing immediate gain takes precedence over stock preservation.

This strategy balances cooperation to maintain resource health with strategic defection to protect individual payoffs when necessary. It adapts based on both stock levels and others' actions, encouraging sustainability while safeguarding against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_140 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Rounds:** Cooperate for the first round to establish trust and maintain a healthy stock level.
- **Stock Threshold:** If the current stock falls below 50% of capacity, switch to cooperation to allow replenishment.
- **Cooperation Monitoring:** After the initial rounds, monitor the number of players who cooperated in the previous round. If at least 50% cooperated, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect as a form of punishment.

**2. Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Always cooperate to initiate a cooperative environment.
- **Last Round:** Continue with the strategy without special treatment, accepting potential endgame defection but ensuring stock health up until then.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
All players using this strategy will base their actions on observed past behavior and current stock levels, promoting a balanced approach between sustainability and deterrence of exploitation.

This strategy aims to maintain resource sustainability while discouraging excessive defection through targeted punishment, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_141 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation while deterring defection in a repeated game with perfect information, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate unconditionally to establish trust and maximize initial joint payoff.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
   - If any player has defected in any previous round, defect as punishment to deter future defections.
   - If all previous rounds have been cooperative, continue to cooperate.
3. **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **First Round (t=1):** Cooperate. This sets a baseline of trust and maximizes the initial payoff for all players.
2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:** Check if any player has defected in previous rounds. If so, defect this round as punishment. Otherwise, continue cooperating.
3. **Last Round (t=r):** Defect to secure the highest possible immediate payoff without concern for future repercussions.

### Rationale:
- The strategy begins with cooperation to establish trust and maximize joint payoffs.
- It incorporates a strict punishment mechanism where any historical defection leads to perpetual defection, deterring players from defecting.
- In the final round, since there are no future interactions, defecting ensures the highest immediate benefit.

This approach balances the need for cooperation with a strong deterrent against defection, providing a clear and predictable behavior pattern in the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_142 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we have developed an adaptive approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors without relying on communication or coordination.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperate-Punish (ACP)

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of trust and maintain the stock.
  
- **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
  - If in the previous round, more than half of the players defected (D), or if the stock after growth was below 75% of capacity, defect (D) this round as a form of punishment and to conserve resources.
  - Otherwise, cooperate (C).

- **Last Round (Round r):**
  - Cooperate (C) if the current stock level is above 50% of the capacity. This encourages sustainability even in the final stages.
  - Defect (D) if the stock is below or equal to 50%, prioritizing immediate gain when long-term sustainability is less critical.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Always cooperate to initialize trust and avoid early depletion.
- **Last Round:** Adjust behavior based on the remaining stock, ensuring a balance between cooperation and self-interest in the final round.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Continuously assess the stock level to prevent over-depletion, ensuring future rounds have sufficient resources.

**3. Collective Mindset:**
The strategy is designed to align individual actions with collective interests by encouraging cooperation unless there's significant defection or stock depletion. It promotes a balance between punishing defectors and maintaining resource sustainability for future interactions.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_cooperate_punish(n, r, capacity, current_stock, history):
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return 'C'
    elif r <= len(history):  # Last round
        if current_stock > 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        prev_actions = history[-1]
        count_defectors = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
        stock_after_growth = calculate_stock(current_stock, prev_actions)
        
        if (count_defectors > n / 2) or (stock_after_growth < 0.75 * capacity):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def calculate_stock(current_stock, actions):
    total_consumption = sum(consume(a, current_stock) for a in actions)
    stock_remaining = max(0, current_stock - total_consumption)
    growth = 2 * stock_remaining * (1 - stock_remaining / capacity)
    new_stock = min(stock_remaining + growth, capacity)

def consume(action, stock):
    if action == 'C':
        return stock / (2 * n)
    else:
        return stock / n
```

### Explanation

- **First Round Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to establish trust and maintain a healthy stock level.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** Defects in subsequent rounds if there's significant defection or low stock, discouraging exploitation.
- **Stock Conservation:** Continuously monitors the stock to ensure it remains sustainable for future rounds.
- **Endgame Strategy:** In the last round, adjusts based on remaining stock, balancing cooperation with immediate self-interest.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, encouraging collective cooperation while being resilient against various opponent strategies.

description_COLLECTIVE_143 = '''
**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

**Objective:**  
To maximize each player's total payoff while maintaining a sustainable common pool resource through adaptive cooperation and strategic punishment.

**Strategy Overview:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - **First Round Action:** Cooperate (C). This sets the tone for mutual benefit by starting with trust and maximizing stock growth from the beginning.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - **Observation & Calculation:** After each round, observe all players' actions (C or D) and calculate:
     - The cooperation rate as the percentage of players who cooperated.
     - The average payoff per player in the previous round to gauge collective success.

3. **Cooperation Threshold:**
   - If the cooperation rate exceeds 70%, continue cooperating in the next round to sustain high stock levels and mutual benefits.

4. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - If the cooperation rate drops below 70%, switch to Defect (D) for a set number of subsequent rounds (e.g., 2-3 rounds). This punishes non-cooperative behavior, encouraging others to revert to cooperation.
   - After the punishment period, reassess the cooperation rate. If it improves, return to Cooperate; if not, continue defecting until improvement is observed.

5. **Stock Sustainability Check:**
   - Monitor the stock level after each round. If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), prioritize cooperation for the next few rounds to allow stock recovery, regardless of the current cooperation rate.

6. **Final Round Strategy:**
   - In the last round, defect to maximize personal gain since there are no future consequences or rounds to consider.

**Edge Cases & Considerations:**

- **Low Stock Levels:** Implement a "stock recovery phase" where players cooperate more frequently if the stock is depleted significantly, ensuring long-term sustainability.
- **Reset Mechanism:** After a punishment phase, allow a period of cooperation if others start cooperating again, fostering mutual benefit and resetting the strategy.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_punishment(n, r, capacity):
    # Initialize variables to track state and history
    stock = capacity
    history = []  # Stores actions of all players each round
    total_payoffs = [0] * n  # Tracks cumulative payoffs for each player
    
    for t in range(r):
        if t == 0:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            # Calculate cooperation rate and average payoff from previous rounds
            coop_rate = sum(1 for actions in history[-1] if actions == 'C') / n
            avg_payoff = sum(total_payoffs) / n
            
            # Determine next action based on thresholds
            if coop_rate >= 0.7:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'
            
            # Check stock level for recovery need
            if stock < capacity * 0.2 and t != r -1:
                action = 'C'
                
        # Execute action and update state, payoffs, and history
        if action == 'C':
            consumption = stock / (2 * n)
        else:
            consumption = stock / n
        
        total_payoffs[i] += consumption  # i is current player index
        
        # Update stock dynamics after all players' actions
        total_consumption = sum of all players' consumptions
        S_remaining = max(0, stock - total_consumption)
        growth = 2 * S_remaining * (1 - S_remaining / capacity)
        stock = min(S_remaining + growth, capacity)
        
        history.append(record of all players' actions this round)
    
    return total_payoffs[i]
```

**Conclusion:**

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by encouraging cooperation while punishing defection. It adapts to the collective behavior of players and prioritizes stock recovery when necessary, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.

description_COLLECTIVE_144 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to initiate sustainable consumption.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - Observe the stock level after growth in the previous round.
     - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
     - If the stock falls below 75%, Defect (D) in the next round as a response to over-consumption.
   - **Last Round:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future stock dependence.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Start with cooperation to establish a sustainable baseline.
   - **Last Round:** Switch to defecting to capture maximum personal gain without concern for future rounds.
   - **Stock Recovery:** If the stock recovers above 75% after a period of defection, revert to cooperating to rebuild sustainability.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   The strategy encourages cooperation when the common resource is sufficiently abundant, promoting collective welfare. It adaptively responds to over-exploitation by punishing with defection, aiming to balance individual and group interests.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
function decide_action(previous_stock, current_round, total_rounds):

**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **Threshold-Based Cooperation:** Players will cooperate if the stock after growth in the previous round is below 50% of the capacity or if more than half of the players defected in the previous round. Otherwise, they may choose to defect.

   **Pseudocode:**
   ```python
   def strategy(stock, capacity, n, history):
       if not history:  # First Round
           return "C"
       previous_actions = history[-1]
       previous_stock_after_growth = stock
       previous_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == "D")
       
       if (previous_stock_after_growth < capacity / 2) or (previous_defectors > n / 2):
           return "C"
       else:
           return "D"
   ```

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** All players cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
   - **Last Round:** Continue with the strategy as usual, prioritizing stock sustainability over immediate gains.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy is designed for all players to follow uniformly, ensuring that collective interests in resource sustainability are maintained while allowing for strategic defection when the resource is plentiful.

This approach balances cooperation and controlled defection, promoting long-term resource health while adapting to the actions of other players.

**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Driven Thresholds**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C). All players start by consuming stock/(2n).
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** Use a dynamic threshold based on the current stock level relative to capacity and past players' actions.
     - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, Cooperate to maintain sustainability while allowing some exploitation.
     - If the stock drops below 50% of capacity, Defect (D) to maximize immediate gains but be cautious of potential depletion.
   - **Adaptive Adjustment:** Monitor the stock growth after each round. If growth is negative or minimal, adjust by increasing cooperation in subsequent rounds to conserve the resource.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline and observe others' behavior without immediate punishment.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize personal payoff since there are no future consequences beyond the current game.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy encourages cooperation when the resource is plentiful but allows for strategic defection when necessary, balancing individual gain with collective sustainability.

This approach ensures players adapt based on environmental and social cues, promoting a balance between self-interest and resource conservation.

To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and resource sustainability.

### Strategy: Adaptive Conservation with Recent Defection Penalty (ACRDP)

**Objective**: Maximize individual payoffs while maintaining the common pool's health through adaptive decision-making.

**Decision Rules**:

1. **First Round Cooperation**:
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and resource conservation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Monitor Defection Rate**: Track the number of players who defected in previous rounds, using a moving average or weighted sum to focus on recent behavior.
   - **Stock Level Check**: Continuously assess the current stock level. If it falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to defecting to secure higher immediate payoffs.
   - **Adaptive Cooperation Threshold**: Maintain a cooperation threshold based on the average defection rate observed. If this rate exceeds the threshold, defect; otherwise, continue cooperating.

3. **Final Round Defection**:
   - In the last round, always choose to defect to maximize immediate gain since there are no future rounds to consider.

4. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust cooperation thresholds dynamically based on remaining rounds and observed behavior, allowing for more leniency in earlier rounds and stricter measures as the game progresses.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, round_number, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round_number == r:
        return "D"
    
    # Calculate average defection rate from recent history (e.g., last few rounds)
    recent_defections = sum(action == 'D' for action in history[-w:])
    avg_defection_rate = recent_defections / (n * w)  # Adjust window size 'w'
    
    if current_stock < critical_stock_level:  # e.g., capacity / (2n)
        return "D"
    elif avg_defection_rate > cooperation_threshold:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"

# Parameters
critical_stock_level = capacity / (2 * n)
cooperation_threshold = 0.5  # Adjust based on game dynamics
window_size = min(r, 10)  # Number of recent rounds to consider

```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to foster a cooperative environment.
- **Adaptive Monitoring**: Tracks defections and stock levels to decide actions, ensuring sustainability without being exploited.
- **Final Round Strategy**: Maximizes immediate payoff when future rounds no longer matter.

This strategy aims to balance individual gain with collective resource management, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior and environmental conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_148 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual gain with collective sustainability in a common-pool resource (CPR) game, we propose an adaptive strategy that each player can follow independently. This approach ensures that players maximize their payoffs while preserving the resource for future rounds when possible.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **First Round Cooperation:**
   - Cooperate on the first round to establish a high initial stock level, promoting sustainability from the start.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - For each subsequent round, check if the current stock level after growth is above 50% of the capacity.
     - If yes, cooperate (C) in the next round to maintain or increase the stock.
     - If no, defect (D) in the next round to secure higher immediate payoffs.

3. **Final Round Defection:**
   - In the last round (when the current round is the final one), always defect (D) to maximize immediate gain without concern for future depletion.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a positive trajectory by preserving the stock, allowing for higher total payoffs over time.
  
- **Adaptive Threshold:** Using a 50% threshold provides a clear, observable metric. If the stock is above this level, it signals that sustainability is maintained, and cooperation continues. Below this level, defecting becomes more favorable to capture higher individual gains before potential depletion.

- **Final Round Defection:** Since there are no future consequences in the last round, defecting ensures the highest possible immediate payoff without impacting subsequent rounds.

### Implementation:

Each player follows these rules independently based on their observation of the stock levels after each round. This strategy requires minimal computation and no coordination, making it practical for dynamic CPR scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_149 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes collective gain from the start.
   - **Rounds 2 to r-1:** 
     - Calculate the total consumption of the previous round by comparing the stock before and after that round's actions.
     - If this consumption exceeds half of the previous stock level, defect (D) in the current round. Otherwise, cooperate (C).
   - **Last Round (r):** Always Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for, maximizing immediate gain is optimal.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the current stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 10% of capacity), defect to secure immediate benefits.
   - **Sustainable Consumption:** Continuously monitor the total consumption relative to sustainable levels, adjusting strategy to maintain stock health unless in the last round.

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   - The strategy aligns with a collective mindset by initially cooperating and only switching to defection when group behavior indicates overconsumption, ensuring fairness and resource preservation.

This approach balances cooperation for sustained benefits with strategic defection to prevent exploitation, adapting dynamically based on observed actions and stock dynamics.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_150 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation with Endgame Defection**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Threshold Cooperation**: In each round, cooperate if the current stock is below 70% of the capacity; otherwise, defect.
   - **Endgame Strategy**: Switch to defecting in the last two rounds to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future sustainability.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Start with cooperation when the stock is at capacity to encourage collective sustainability.
   - **Stock Recovery**: If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), prioritize recovery by cooperating unless in the endgame phase.

3. **Adaptive Component**:
   - Monitor the trend of the stock level over recent rounds. If the stock shows a declining trend despite cooperation, temporarily switch to defecting to protect individual payoffs and encourage others to cooperate.

This strategy balances the need for resource sustainability with opportunities for maximizing individual gains, adapting based on the current state and trends observed in the game.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**

     - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect this round as a punitive measure.
     - Otherwise, cooperate to maintain sustainable consumption and stock growth.
   - **Last Round:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future consequences don't apply.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - In rounds where the stock is critically low (e.g., below 50% of capacity), prioritize cooperation to prevent depletion.
   - If the number of players defecting in the previous round exceeds a threshold (e.g., more than half), switch to defection to deter excessive exploitation.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy encourages cooperation when possible and punishes widespread defection, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.
   - Public information, such as stock levels and past actions, guides decisions without requiring communication or coordination.

This approach adapts based on the game's state and history, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors while maintaining resource sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_152 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative foundation and encourage trust among players.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Previous Actions and Stock Level:**
     - Track the number of defectors in the previous round.
     - Assess the current stock level after regeneration.

   - **Decision Rules:**
     - **Defect (D)** if either:
       1. More than half of the players defected in the previous round, indicating a breakdown in cooperation.
       2. The current stock level is below a threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), signaling potential depletion.
     - **Cooperate (C)** otherwise to maintain stock health and encourage reciprocity.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last two rounds, switch to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on past actions and current state, ensuring robustness against various player behaviors while promoting cooperation when beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_153 = '''
To determine whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock level, we can use a threshold strategy:

1. **Cooperate** if the current stock (S) is greater than half of the maximum capacity (C/2).
2. **Defect** if the current stock is less than or equal to C/2.

This strategy aims to maintain high stock levels by cooperating when resources are plentiful and defecting when they are scarce, balancing individual gain with collective sustainability.

**Answer:** Cooperate if S > C/2; otherwise, defect.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_154 = '''
To ensure sustainable extraction while maximizing individual gain towards the end, each player follows these rules:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C).
2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate to help replenish.
   - Otherwise, if it's not the last round, Cooperate with a high probability (e.g., 80%).
3. **Last Round**: Always Defect (D).

This strategy balances maintaining a healthy stock level early on and maximizing individual gain in the final round.

**Answer:**

Each player should cooperate unless it is the last round or the stock has dropped below half of its capacity, in which case they should defect. Formally, the strategy is:

- Cooperate if it's the first round.
- Cooperate if the current stock is less than 50% of the maximum capacity.
- Defect if it's the last round.

Otherwise, cooperate with a high probability to maintain sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_155 = '''
To address the problem of determining the optimal strategy for each round, we can use a simple yet effective approach that balances cooperation with punishment for defection. The goal is to maximize collective payoff while ensuring that individual actions align with maintaining a healthy stock level. Here's the structured solution:

### Strategy:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C). 
   - Start by cooperating to initiate potential mutual cooperation and build trust.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (from 2 to r-1):**
   - **If it's not the last round:**
     - Observe the stock level after each round.
     - If the current stock level is higher than the previous round, continue Cooperating (C).
     - If the current stock level is lower or unchanged, Defect (D) as a punitive measure.

3. **Last Round:** Always Defect (D). 
   - In the final round, defect to maximize individual payoff without concern for future repercussions.

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation encourages mutual collaboration and sets a positive tone.
- **Stock Level Observation:** By monitoring whether the stock increases or decreases, we indirectly assess the level of cooperation. An increase suggests sufficient cooperation, while a decrease indicates too many defections.
- **Punitive Defection:** Defecting when the stock does not improve serves as a deterrent against excessive defection, promoting a balance that maintains a healthy stock.
- **Final Round Defection:** In the last round, defecting ensures maximum individual gain since there are no future interactions to impact.

### Algorithm in Pseudocode:
```
def strategy():
    for each round from 1 to r:
        if round == 1:
            action = Cooperate
        elif round == r:
            action = Defect
        else:
            previous_stock = get_previous_stock_level()
            current_stock = get_current_stock_level()
            if current_stock > previous_stock:
                action = Cooperate
            else:
                action = Defect
    return action

```

This strategy ensures that players cooperate when mutual efforts yield positive outcomes and defect when necessary to maintain individual and collective benefits, striking a balance between cooperation and self-interest.

**Sustainable Cooperation with Punishment (SCoP) Strategy**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - Calculate a cooperation threshold as `(remaining_rounds / total_rounds) * capacity`.
     - If the stock is above this threshold and at least `cooperation_rate` players cooperated in the previous round, cooperate.
     - Otherwise, defect for up to 2 rounds (punishment phase).
   - **Last Round:** Always defect.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Low Stock:** If stock is near zero, defect to maximize immediate gain.
   - **Final Rounds:** Adjust behavior to prevent over-depletion by considering the game's end.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - Encourages sustained cooperation through mutual monitoring and punishment, ensuring resource conservation for future rounds.

This strategy balances cooperation and punishment, adapting dynamically based on game progression and stock levels, promoting long-term payoffs while deterring exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_157 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

1. **First Round Action:** Cooperate (C). This initiates the game with a cooperative stance, encouraging others to do the same and maintaining the stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r):**
   - **Observation:** At the end of each round, observe the stock level (S_prev) after all actions and growth.
   - **Threshold Check:** Determine if S_prev is at least 70% of the capacity. This threshold indicates whether cooperation is effectively maintaining the stock.
     - **If S_prev ≥ 0.7 * Capacity:** Choose to Cooperate (C). This sustains the high stock level, maximizing future payoffs.
     - **If S_prev < 0.7 * Capacity:** Switch to Defect (D) for this round as a punitive measure. This response aims to penalize excessive defection and encourage others to return to cooperation.

3. **Final Round Handling:** Treat the last round similarly to other rounds. Continue using the same strategy without special casing, ensuring consistency in behavior throughout the game.

**Rationale:**
- **Cooperation Start:** Begins with cooperation to set a collaborative tone.
- **Stock-Level Adaptive Response:** Adjusts based on observed stock levels, promoting sustainability and punishing detrimental behavior.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** Temporarily defects when the stock is low to deter excessive defection, encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Consistency:** Maintains strategy throughout all rounds, including the last, to avoid last-round exploitation and preserve a fair approach.

This strategy balances cooperation with necessary punishment, aiming to maintain high payoffs while being robust against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_158 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining the stock level in a repeated game with perfect information, we can implement an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on observed trends. Here's a structured approach:

### Adaptive Stock Preservation Strategy

1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by Cooperating in the first round. This establishes a baseline of mutual trust and resource preservation.

2. **Monitor Stock Trends**: After each round, evaluate whether the stock has decreased over the past two consecutive rounds.
   - If the stock has decreased twice consecutively, switch to Defecting in the next round.
   - If the stock is stable or increasing, continue Cooperating.

3. **Revert to Cooperation**: Once a player starts defecting, they will return to Cooperating if the stock increases for two consecutive rounds, indicating recovery.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages resource preservation and sets a cooperative tone.
- **Stock Trend Monitoring**: Allows players to adapt based on collective behavior, preventing over-exploitation.
- **Revert Mechanism**: Enables recovery of the stock if enough players return to cooperation.

This strategy aims to sustainably manage the resource by leveraging observed trends and adaptive decision-making.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_159 = '''
The AI considered various strategies to determine the optimal approach for maximizing payoffs while maintaining the stock level. It started by evaluating cooperation and defection triggers based on total consumption relative to a sustainable threshold (half the stock). The strategy involves:

1. **Cooperate** in the first round.
2. For each subsequent round, calculate the total consumption from the previous round using observed stock levels.
3. If the total consumption exceeds half of the previous stock level, switch to defecting in the next round.
4. Continue defecting unless a subsequent round shows total consumption at or below the sustainable threshold, indicating others may be cooperating again.

The final strategy is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate in the first round and continue cooperating unless the total consumption in any subsequent round exceeds half of the stock, in which case defect thereafter.}}

description_COLLECTIVE_160 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observed behavior and stock levels. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACWP)

1. **First Round Action:**
   - All players Cooperate (C) to initiate mutual cooperation and observe others' responses.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. **Monitor Past Behavior:** Track the number of times each player has Defected in previous rounds.
   b. **Determine Proportion of Defectors:** Calculate the proportion of players who Defected in the last round.
   c. **Threshold Check:** If the proportion of Defectors exceeds 30%, switch to Defecting (D) for the next round as a punitive measure.
   d. **Stock Level Monitoring:** Continuously observe the stock level after each round. If it drops below 50% of capacity, Defect until the stock recovers above this threshold.
   e. **Forgiveness Mechanism:** After punishing by Defecting for a set number of rounds (e.g., two consecutive rounds), revert to Cooperating if the majority returns to Cooperation and the stock level shows signs of recovery.

3. **Punishment Phase:**
   - Implement a temporary switch to Defection when the threshold is crossed, signaling disapproval of excessive defection.
   - Limit punishment duration to prevent permanent harm to the collective resource.

4. **Stock Conservation:**
   - Prioritize maintaining the stock above 50% of capacity by Cooperating during recovery phases and adjusting consumption rates accordingly.

5. **Endgame Consideration:**
   - In the final rounds, if the stock is sufficiently high (e.g., above 75% of capacity), players may choose to defect to maximize immediate payoffs without jeopardizing future sustainability beyond the game's scope.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(player_id, n, r, capacity, history):
    # Initialize cooperation in the first round
    if len(history) == 0:
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate proportion of defectors in last round
    last_actions = [action for action in history[-1]]
    defector_count = sum(1 for a in last_actions if a == 'D')
    defect_proportion = defector_count / n
    
    # Check stock level after last round
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    # Determine action based on thresholds and stock
    if defect_proportion > 0.3 or current_stock < capacity / 2:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"

    # After punishment phase, revert to cooperation if conditions improve
    # (Implementation details for forgiveness mechanism would be added here)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to encourage mutual benefit and observe others' behavior.
- **Adaptive Response:** Adjusts actions based on the proportion of defectors and stock health, ensuring that excessive defection is met with punitive measures.
- **Stock Conservation:** Prioritizes resource sustainability by monitoring and responding to stock levels, preventing depletion through strategic defection when necessary.
- **Forgiveness Mechanism:** Allows for recovery and return to cooperation after temporary punishment, maintaining long-term collective benefit.

This strategy encourages sustained cooperation while robustly addressing exploitation, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and future resource availability.

**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

**Objective:**  
To design a strategy that encourages sustained cooperation while effectively punishing defection, ensuring long-term resource sustainability and maximizing collective payoffs.

**Strategy Overview:**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial stock maintenance.

2. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - After each round, assess the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If the stock is above 50% of capacity, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock falls below 50%, initiate punishment by defecting for the next two rounds.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Defect for up to two consecutive rounds when the stock drops below the threshold.
   - Monitor the stock during this period; if it recovers above 50% before the two rounds end, revert to cooperation early.

4. **Final Round Handling:**
   - In the last round, cooperate if the stock is above 50% of capacity; otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages trust and maintains the stock, setting a positive precedent.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Dynamically adjusts behavior based on resource health, ensuring sustainability.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** Deters exploitation by reducing cooperation only when necessary, with a clear exit strategy to avoid perpetual punishment cycles.
- **Final Round Handling:** Balances immediate gain with the need to leave a healthy stock level, encouraging cooperation if beneficial.

This strategy promotes cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation, ensuring a robust and adaptive approach to managing the common pool resource.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Decision:**
   - **First Round:** All players Cooperate (C). This maximizes initial collective payoff and sets a cooperative tone.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** Monitor the stock level after each round.
     - If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, all players switch to Cooperate in the next round to allow replenishment.
   - **Defection Response:** Track the number of players who Defected in the previous round.
     - If more than half defected, all players Defect in the next round to penalize non-cooperative behavior.
     - If fewer than half defected, continue with the current strategy (Cooperate if stock is above threshold, else Cooperate).

3. **Late Game Strategy:**
   - As the game progresses towards the final rounds, introduce a gradual shift towards Cooperation.
     - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 20%), increase the propensity to Cooperate to ensure the stock doesn't deplete entirely, maintaining some resource for all players.

    stock_after = prev_round['stock_after']
    actions = prev_round['actions']
    
    # Calculate number of defectors last round
    defectors = sum(1 for action in actions if action == 'D')
    
    # Determine next action based on rules
    if stock_after < 0.5 * capacity:
        return "C"
    elif defectors > n / 2:
        return "D"
    else:
        # Check if in later rounds, shift towards Cooperate
        current_round = len(history) + 1
        if current_round > 0.8 * r:  # Last 20% of rounds
            return "C"
        else:
            return "C" if defectors <= n / 2 else "D"

    return "C"  # Default to Cooperate if conditions not met
```

**Explanation:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with Cooperation sets a positive precedent and maximizes initial payoffs.
- **Stock Management:** By monitoring the stock level, players ensure that the resource doesn't deplete below a sustainable threshold, prompting a switch to Cooperation when necessary.
- **Punishing Defectors:** Responding to widespread Defection by switching strategies discourages non-cooperative behavior and maintains balance.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Gradually increasing Cooperation towards the end ensures that the stock isn't exhausted, providing a fair payoff distribution in the final rounds.

This strategy balancespunishment for defectors with incentives for cooperation, ensuring long-term sustainability of the common resource.

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone, encouraging others to reciprocate.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - Monitor the cooperation rate of all players in the previous round. If at least 75% of players cooperated and the stock level is above 50% of capacity, choose C.
     - If fewer than 75% cooperated or the stock is below 50%, switch to Defect (D) to protect against overexploitation.
   - **Last Round:** Observe the majority action in the previous round. If most defected, choose D; otherwise, choose C.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to initiate cooperation and maximize collective welfare.
   - **Middle Rounds:** Adapt based on historical cooperation rates and stock levels to balance immediate gain with future sustainability.
   - **Last Round:** Adjust strategy based on the final observed actions to either maintain cooperation or defect if others are doing so.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   The strategy encourages mutual cooperation by reciprocating cooperative behavior, thereby aligning individual actions with collective welfare. It also safeguards against exploitation by adapting to defection when necessary.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def adaptive_strategy(game_state):
    if game_state.round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        previous_cooperation = count_of_C_in_previous_round() / total_players
        stock_level = game_state.stock / game_state.capacity
        if previous_cooperation >= 0.75 and stock_level >= 0.5:
            return "C"
        elif game_state.round == game_state.total_rounds:
            majority_last_action = get_majority_action_from_previous_round()
            if majority_last_action == "D":
                return "D"
            else:
                return "C"
        else:
            if previous_cooperation < 0.75 or stock_level < 0.5:
                return "D"
```

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, promoting cooperation while protecting against overexploitation, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability of the common resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_164 = '''
To address the challenge of determining an optimal strategy for sustainable resource utilization in a repeated game scenario, we can outline the following structured approach:

### Strategy Outline:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C). All players take S/(2n) from the stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Level Check:** At the start of each round, evaluate the stock level after growth from the previous round.
     - If the stock level is below a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), defect in the current round to secure higher immediate payoffs.
   - **Punishment Mechanism:** Monitor the actions of other players in the previous round.
     - If more than a certain number of players defected last round (e.g., more than half), defect this round as a punitive measure.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Cooperate to maximize the final payoff sustainably, ensuring a higher total payoff over all rounds rather than risking it for immediate gain.

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a foundation for sustainable resource use.
- **Stock Level Trigger:** Defecting when the stock is low prevents further depletion and ensures some payoff even if the future is uncertain.
- **Punishment for Defection:** Deters others from defecting by imposing consequences, maintaining cooperation stability.
- **Last Round Cooperation:** Prioritizes a balanced final payoff, considering the collective benefit over individual greed.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability and incorporates mechanisms to deter excessive defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_165 = '''
**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Sustainability**

**1. First Round Strategy:**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Initiate cooperation to encourage a positive starting point and observe other players' initial moves.

**2. Subsequent Rounds Strategy:**
   - **Last Round Check:** If it's the final round, switch to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff as future consequences are irrelevant.
   
   - **Cooperation Rate Calculation:** Track the average cooperation rate of all players over previous rounds. This can be a simple moving average or weighted average where more recent rounds have higher weight.

   - **Stock Threshold Evaluation:** Determine if the current stock level is above a certain threshold relative to capacity (e.g., 50%). This helps assess whether the resource is sustainably managed.

**3. Decision Rules:**
- **Cooperate (C):** Choose this action if:
  - The average cooperation rate from previous rounds meets or exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 70%).
  - The current stock level is above the predefined sustainability threshold.
  
- **Defect (D):** Choose this action if either condition for cooperation isn't met. This adapts to others' behavior and resource health.

**4. Forgiveness Mechanism:**
   - If after a period of defection, other players begin cooperating again, gradually increase cooperation propensity. This prevents permanent punishment and allows for renewed cooperation if others change their strategy.

**5. Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock's trend (increasing or decreasing). If the stock is improving, consider increasing cooperation to reward positive trends. If it's depleting, reduce cooperation to protect individual payoffs.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability by adapting based on others' actions and the resource's state, ensuring robustness across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_166 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Cooperation (ACC)**

The ACC strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection dynamically based on observed behavior and stock levels. It encourages initial cooperation, adapts to others' actions, protects against stock depletion, and ensures optimal play in the final round.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish trust and maintain high stock levels.

2. **Middle Rounds (2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock is below 25% of capacity, Defect (D).
   - **Defection Threshold:** Count the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     - If more than 50% defected last round → Defect this round.
     - Otherwise → Cooperate (C).

3. **Last Round:**
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Low Stock:** Switch to defection if stock drops below a critical level to secure immediate benefits.
- **Final Round:** Prioritize short-term gain by defecting, as future consequences are irrelevant.
- **Forgiveness Window:** After a period of cooperation, reset strategy to cooperate if others do the same.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(player_id, n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1

    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    if current_round == r:
        return "D"

    # Calculate stock after last round
    last_stock = get_last_stock(history)
    if last_stock < 0.25 * capacity:
        return "D"

    # Count defectors in previous round
    prev_actions = history[-1]
    defector_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == "D")
    defect_ratio = defector_count / n

    if defect_ratio > 0.5:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"

# Example usage
history = [...]  # List of previous rounds' actions
action = strategy(1, n=4, r=10, capacity=100, history=history)
print(action)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to maintain a healthy stock.
- **Adaptive Response:** Adjusts based on others' past actions and current stock health.
- **Final Round Defection:** Maximizes immediate payoff without future consequences.

This strategy aims to sustain resource use while being robust against exploitation, ensuring long-term collective benefit.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_167 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round based on the stock level and others' actions, I propose a strategy that balances maintaining the stock for future payoffs with securing current gains. The approach considers the trend in the stock level over previous rounds.

**Strategy:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate.
   - Start by cooperating to maximize the initial stock level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:** 
   - After each round, observe the stock level after regeneration.
   - If the stock after regeneration in the previous round is higher than it was two rounds ago (i.e., the stock is increasing), continue cooperating.
   - If the stock is decreasing over two consecutive rounds, defect this round to secure higher payoffs while the stock is still sufficient.

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation when Stock Increases:** By cooperating when the stock is rising, we maintain a healthy stock level for future rounds. This strategy rewards continued cooperation with increased or stable stock levels.
  
- **Defection when Stock Decreases:** If the stock shows a declining trend over two consecutive rounds, it indicates that total consumption may be too high due to others defecting. Defecting in this scenario allows you to secure higher payoffs now before the stock potentially depletes further.

This strategy is responsive to the overall health of the stock and adapts based on observable trends, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and switching to defection when necessary to protect individual payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_168 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Threshold Calculation:** Each player maintains a dynamic threshold based on the stock's recent trends. The initial threshold is set at 50% of the capacity. 
- **Action Determination:** In each round, if the current stock level is above the threshold, the player Cooperates (C). If below, they Defect (D).

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to maximize initial stock sustainability.
- **Last Round:** Continue using the same strategy; defect only if the stock is below the threshold to maintain consistency and fairness.

**3. Adaptive Mechanism:**
- **Stock Trend Monitoring:** After each round, players adjust their threshold based on the stock's movement. If the stock has been decreasing over the past few rounds, lower the threshold to encourage cooperation. Conversely, if the stock is stable or increasing, raise the threshold cautiously.
- **Smooth Adjustment:** Use a moving average of recent stock levels to determine trends, preventing abrupt strategy changes.

**4. Collective Alignment:**
- By focusing on the shared resource's health, all players using ATC work towards sustaining the stock, ensuring mutual long-term benefits and robustness against varying opponent behaviors.

This strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable resource management, adapting collectively to maintain a healthy stock level for all players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_169 = '''
To design a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can adopt an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with the need to defect when necessary. The strategy is designed to maintain the sustainability of the common pool while ensuring each player maximizes their payoff without being exploited by others.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACST)

#### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and observe others' behavior without immediate depletion of the stock.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (not last)**:
   - **Observations**:
     - Count the number of players who defected in the previous round (`D_count`).
     - Note the current stock level after growth from the previous round.
   - **Conditions**:
     1. If `D_count > n/2`: This indicates a majority of players defected, prompting a switch to defection to avoid being exploited.
        - **Action**: Defect (D)
     2. Else if the current stock level is below 50% of capacity: Cooperating may not be sustainable, so defect to maximize immediate payoff.
        - **Action**: Defect (D)
     3. Otherwise: Continue cooperating to maintain a healthy stock for future rounds.
        - **Action**: Cooperate (C)

3. **Last Round**:
   - **Action**: Always Defect (D)
     - Rationale: In the final round, there is no future benefit to maintaining the stock, so maximize immediate payoff.

### Rationale:

- **Cooperation in Early Rounds**: Encourages initial resource conservation and allows players to gauge others' behavior.
- **Adaptation Based on Majority Defection**: Switching to defection when a majority have defected prevents being exploited by free-riders.
- **Stock Level Threshold**: Ensures that if the stock is critically low, players prioritize immediate gain over potential future benefits.
- **Final Round Defection**: Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future resource sustainability.

This strategy is robust as it reacts to both the behavior of other players and the state of the common pool, ensuring a balance between cooperation and self-interest.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_170 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - All players start by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline and maintain a healthy initial stock level.

2. **Adaptive Strategy for Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** Monitor the current stock level. If it falls below 50% of capacity, increase cooperation rates to allow regrowth.
   - **Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness:** Adjust cooperation based on the average cooperation rate from the previous round. If a significant number of players defected, respond by defecting in the next round but gradually return to cooperation over subsequent rounds to encourage mutual cooperation without being exploited.

3. **Last Round Decision:**
   - Assess the stock level in the final round. Cooperate if the stock is above 50% capacity to sustain it; otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff since future consequences aren't a concern.

This strategy balances individual gains with collective sustainability, adapts based on past actions and stock health, and addresses edge cases effectively.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_171 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and punishment while ensuring long-term sustainability. Here's a structured strategy based on the thought process:

### Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation (ARC)

**1. Initial Rounds:**
- **Action:** Cooperate in the first few rounds to establish trust and maintain a high stock level.

**2. Monitoring and Punishment:**
- **Cooperation Threshold:** Calculate the average cooperation rate each round.
  - If ≥75% of players cooperate, continue cooperating next round.
  - If <75%, switch to defecting for one round as punishment.

**3. Rebuild Phase:**
- After punishing, monitor if cooperation levels improve:
  - If cooperation increases sufficiently, return to cooperating.
  - This allows defectors a chance to reform without harsh penalties.

**4. Stock Thresholds:**
- **Stock Trigger:** Implement stock level triggers (e.g., below 50% of capacity) to prompt cooperation for recovery.
  - All players should cooperate when the stock is low to prevent depletion.

**5. Final Rounds:**
- In the last few rounds, especially if stock is low:
  - Switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains, as future penalties are nonexistent.

**6. Adaptive Forgiveness:**
- Be forgiving towards occasional defectors who return to cooperation.
- Avoid being exploited by not forgiving too easily; maintain a balance in reciprocity.

### Key Considerations:

- **Coordination:** Designed for collective adoption but robust against independent strategies.
- **Stock Recovery:** Closely monitor stock levels using non-linear growth dynamics to ensure sustainability.
- **Last Round Incentives:** Adjust behavior in final rounds to account for the absence of future consequences.

This strategy, ARC, is adaptive and reciprocal, aiming to maximize collective payoffs by encouraging cooperation while deterring defection through measured punishment. It ensures long-term stock sustainability and adapts to various player behaviors encountered in a tournament setting.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_172 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Cooperation (ACC)**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to establish a high initial stock level.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     - If the stock has increased or remained stable from the previous round, Cooperate.
     - If the stock decreased in the previous round, Defect once as a punishment signal.
     - After defecting, monitor subsequent rounds. If the stock begins to recover (increase), revert to Cooperation; if not, continue Defecting until recovery.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to maximize initial stock and encourage cooperation.
   - **Last Rounds**: Maintain the strategy as usual since each round's impact on future payoffs matters even near the end.

3. **Collective Alignment**:
   - The strategy is designed to maintain a sustainable stock level, benefiting all players by encouraging cooperation through reciprocal actions based on observed outcomes.

This strategy promotes long-term sustainability of the common pool resource by adaptively responding to stock trends, punishing defection while allowing for forgiveness and recovery.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_173 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock Trends**

The proposed strategy is an adaptive approach that uses the common pool's stock level as a public signal to guide cooperative or defective behavior, balancing long-term sustainability with immediate payoffs.

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to initiate trust and maintain a healthy stock.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Calculate the average stock level over the past three rounds.
  - If this average is above 75% of capacity, continue cooperating.
  - If it drops below 50% of capacity, defect (D) in the next round to signal dissatisfaction and incentivize cooperation.
  
- **Last Round**: Cooperate if the current stock is above 50% of capacity to ensure some growth for future rounds. Defect if the stock is below this threshold to maximize immediate payoff.

### 2. Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round**: Always cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
- **Last Round (r)**: Use the 50% capacity threshold to decide between cooperation and defection, ensuring consideration of both immediate gain and future sustainability.
- **Near Capacity**: Cooperate to maintain resource health.
- **Low Stock (<50%)**: Consider defecting to maximize immediate benefits when the stock is significantly depleted.

### 3. Collective Alignment:
This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by prioritizing stock sustainability, using cooperative actions when the stock is healthy and defecting only as a corrective measure when necessary. It is robust against various opponent behaviors without relying on communication or coordination.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'  # First round
    elif len(history) == r-1:
        current_stock = history[-1]['stock']
        if current_stock > 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        avg_stock = average of last three stock levels in history
        if avg_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif avg_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Alternate based on trend or continue previous action
            return previous_action

# Note: This pseudocode is a simplified representation.
```

This strategy aims to maintain a balance between cooperation and necessary punishment, ensuring the common pool resource remains sustainable for all players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_174 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** All players Cooperate (C). This establishes an initial trust and maximizes stock regeneration.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Calculate the expected total consumption if all cooperated, which is Stock / 2.
  - Compare this with the actual total consumption from the previous round.
  - If the actual consumption exceeds the expected by a significant threshold (e.g., 10%), players Defect (D) in the next round as a form of punishment. Otherwise, continue Cooperating.
- **Stock Monitoring:**
  - Maintain the stock above 50% of capacity. If it drops below this level, switch to Defecting for a set number of rounds to allow regeneration.
  - After defecting, reassess the stock level; if it has recovered above the threshold, revert to Cooperating.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to build trust and observe others' behavior.
- **Last Round:** Assess the current stock health. If the stock is healthy (above 50% capacity), Cooperate to maintain sustainability. If it's low, Defect to maximize immediate gain since there are no future rounds to punish.
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock reaches zero, all players should Cooperate in subsequent rounds to allow regeneration.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
- The strategy is designed for mutual cooperation without communication, relying on observable actions and state.
- By using a uniform response mechanism based on past actions and current stock levels, it promotes a balanced approach between sustainability and self-interest.
- Forgiveness is incorporated by returning to Cooperation once the stock recovers or others demonstrate cooperative behavior.

This strategy aims to balance individual gain with collective sustainability through adaptive cooperation and calibrated punishment.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_175 = '''
To address the problem of determining the optimal strategy for each player in a multi-round game where decisions impact future outcomes, we can outline a structured approach. The goal is to balance between maintaining high payoffs in early rounds and maximizing individual gain in the final round.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets a starting point with no prior information.
   
2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   - If the current stock level (S) is above 50% of the capacity, continue cooperating.
   - Otherwise, switch to defecting (D).
   
3. **Last Round (r):**
   - Always defect (D), as there are no future rounds to consider.

### Explanation:

- **First Round:** Starting with cooperation ensures that players begin on a positive note without prior data, encouraging initial resource buildup.
  
- **Middle Rounds:** Using the 50% threshold helps maintain a balance. If resources are plentiful, cooperation sustains them; if depleted, defection allows individual gain before potential exhaustion.

- **Final Round:** Defecting in the last round maximizes immediate payoff since there's no future impact to consider, aligning with individual rationality despite collective consequences.

### Summary:

Players follow a threshold-based strategy, cooperating when resources are sufficient and defecting otherwise, with a strategic switch to defection in the final round. This approach aims to optimize individual payoffs while considering collective resource management dynamics.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_176 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an adaptive and robust collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose the "Adaptive Cooperation Threshold" (ACT) strategy. This approach balances individual gain with collective sustainability by dynamically adjusting cooperation based on observed history and current stock levels.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to encourage initial resource sustainability and observe others' actions.

2. **Adaptive Thresholds:**
   - **Stock Health Threshold:** If the stock is above 50% of capacity, continue cooperation.
   - **Cooperation Quorum:** Maintain cooperation if at least 75% of players cooperated in the previous round.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - If either threshold is breached, switch to defecting for one round (or until thresholds are met again).

4. **Endgame Adjustment:**
   - In the last three rounds, revert to cooperation to sustain stock levels for future rounds if applicable.

5. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Adjust strategy based on recent actions and stock trends to ensure responsiveness.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - All players start by cooperating (C) to establish a baseline of trust and resource conservation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Health Check:** Calculate the current stock level as a percentage of capacity.
     - If stock ≥ 50%: Cooperate if at least 75% of players cooperated last round; otherwise, defect.
     - If stock < 50%: Defect to maximize immediate payoff unless recent cooperation was high.

3. **Punishment for Defection:**
   - If a player defects and causes significant stock depletion, other players defect in the next round as retaliation.

4. **Endgame Strategy (Last Three Rounds):**
   - Players switch to unconditional cooperation to prevent resource exhaustion, ensuring future sustainability.

5. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level and players' actions.
   - Adjust cooperation thresholds based on observed behavior trends.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def ACT_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, history, round):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate last round's cooperation rate
    coop_last = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C') / n
    
    # Stock health threshold
    stock_threshold = current_stock / capacity
    
    if stock_threshold >= 0.5 and coop_last >= 0.75:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def endgame_strategy(round, total_rounds):
    if round > total_rounds - 3:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a positive tone for resource management.
- **Stock and Cooperation Thresholds:** Ensures that cooperation continues only when beneficial and sustainable.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** Deters excessive defection by imposing consequences.
- **Endgame Adjustment:** Safeguards against final-round exploitation, promoting long-term sustainability.

This strategy encourages cooperation while being resilient to defection, aiming for a balance between individual and collective benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_177 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first round, all players cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes the stock's sustainability from the beginning.

2. **Reciprocity-Based Punishment**:
   - **Threshold Detection**: Monitor the number of defectors in each round. If more than 50% of players defected in the previous round, switch to defecting (D) in the current round to punish defectors.
   - **Forgiveness**: After punishing, return to cooperation if the majority cooperated in the subsequent round, encouraging resumption of cooperative behavior.

3. **Stock Conservation**:
   - **Low Stock Trigger**: If the stock falls below 30% of capacity, all players switch to cooperating (C) regardless of others' actions to conserve and replenish the stock.
   - **Conservation Mode**: In this mode, prioritize cooperation to allow stock recovery, even if it means temporary lower payoffs.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **Last Round Strategy**: Continue with the current strategy unless the stock is critically low (below 20% of capacity), in which case cooperate to aid recovery.
   - **Adaptive Thresholds**: Use a moving average of past defections to determine punishment thresholds, avoiding over-reaction to isolated incidents.

5. **Information Utilization**:
   - Leverage perfect information to track others' actions and adjust strategies dynamically, ensuring informed decisions based on historical data.

6. **Robustness Against Defectors**:
   - If persistent defectors are detected, employ a gradual approach by increasing cooperative actions if others show cooperation, aiming to restart mutual cooperation.

This strategy balances sustainability with punishment, adapts to stock conditions, and uses historical data to foster cooperation while deterring excessive defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_178 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an adaptive and robust collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a dynamic approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring resource sustainability while protecting individual payoffs.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Forgiveness (ACF)

The ACF strategy encourages initial cooperation, monitors the stock level and others' actions, and adapts behavior to maintain resource health while discouraging exploitation. It integrates elements of reciprocity and forgiveness to allow for recovery when possible.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative tone and allow the stock to grow.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Stock Level**: If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, consider the resource healthy.
   - **Assess Recent Cooperation**: Calculate the average cooperation rate from the last round (percentage of players who cooperated).
     - **High Cooperation (>70%) and Healthy Stock**: Continue cooperating to sustain the resource.
     - **Low Cooperation (≤70%) or Unhealthy Stock**: Defect to protect against overexploitation.

3. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: If after defecting, the stock recovers above 50% of capacity in subsequent rounds due to increased cooperation, resume cooperating. This allows for recovery and resets the cooperative dynamic.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there’s no future consequence.
   - **Very Low Stock (Near Zero)**: Defect as there's minimal benefit in cooperating when the resource is depleted.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_with_forgiveness(game_params, current_state, history):
    n = game_params['n']
    r = game_params['r']

### Strategy Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Sets a cooperative foundation, encouraging others to do the same and allowing stock growth.
- **Stock Monitoring**: Ensures that cooperation continues only when the resource is healthy, preventing overexploitation.
- **Forgiveness Mechanism**: Allows resumption of cooperation if the stock recovers, promoting sustainability without permanent punishment.
- **Adaptive Defection**: Protects against exploitation by defecting when necessary, while the last round optimization ensures maximum payoff in the final round.

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by prioritizing resource health and encouraging cooperative behavior, adaptively responding to changes in the environment and others' actions.

description_COLLECTIVE_179 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a common resource through strategic decisions in a repeated game scenario, I propose the following approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players should Cooperate to establish trust and maximize the initial stock level.

2. **Stock Level Monitoring**: After each round, evaluate the remaining stock (S) relative to its capacity (C). If S is above a certain threshold (e.g., 80% of C), continue Cooperating. This encourages maintaining a healthy stock level conducive to future growth.

3. **Punishment Mechanism**: If in any round, the stock drops below the defined threshold, switch to Defecting for a set number of subsequent rounds as a punitive measure against over-exploitation. This serves to deter excessive Defection and incentivizes others to return to Cooperative behavior.

4. **Forgiveness Clause**: After punishing Defectors for a predetermined period, revert to Cooperation if the stock level has recovered above the threshold. This allows re-entry into Cooperative strategies once sustainability is restored.

5. **Endgame Consideration**: If the number of rounds is known and nearing its end, players may opt to defect more frequently in the final stages, as future punishments become irrelevant.

**Final Strategy Summary**:
- Cooperate if the stock level remains above 80% of capacity.
- Defect when the stock falls below this threshold for a set period before potentially returning to Cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_180 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACPP)**

1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1 to R-1):**
   - **Cooperation Phase:** Cooperate by choosing action C in the first round and continue cooperating as long as the stock remains above a defined threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity) and the number of defections in previous rounds is below a certain percentage (e.g., 30%).
   - **Punishment Mechanism:** If the stock drops below the threshold or if defections exceed the percentage, switch to defecting (D) for a set number of rounds (e.g., 2-3 rounds). This serves as a punishment phase to deter excessive defection.

2. **Stock Recovery Check:**
   - After initiating punishment, monitor the stock level. If it recovers above the threshold and defections decrease below the percentage during the punishment period, revert to cooperation.

3. **Final Round (Round R):**
   - In the last round, switch to defecting (D) as there is no future punishment possible beyond the current game. This strategic defection aims to maximize immediate payoff without long-term consequences within the game.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```
function ACPPStrategy Parameters:
    n: number of players
    r: number of rounds
    capacity: maximum stock level
    stock_history: list of past stock levels
    defect_count: count of defections observed

For each round from 1 to r:
    if current_round == r:
        action = D
    else:
        if stock_last_round < threshold or defect_count > allowed_defections:
            action = D for punishment_duration rounds
        else:
            action = C
    update stock_history and defect_count based on actions taken
```

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation Threshold:** Encourages initial cooperation to maintain a healthy stock level, allowing sustainable growth.
- **Punishment Phase:** Acts as a deterrent against excessive defection by collectively reducing payoffs for defectors through stock depletion.
- **Recovery Mechanism:** Allows the strategy to revert to cooperation once conditions improve, promoting long-term sustainability.
- **Final Round Defection:** Acknowledges the endgame scenario where future punishments are irrelevant, optimizing immediate payoff.

This strategy balances collective welfare with individual incentives, fostering cooperation while strategically defecting when necessary to maintain stock health and maximize payoffs.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Sustainability (ACSS)

**Objective:**  
Maximize individual payoffs while ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool through adaptive cooperation based on stock dynamics and opponent behavior.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**
The strategy combines cooperative and defective actions, adapting based on the current state and historical outcomes:

#### **A. Initial Cooperation (First Round)**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial payoffs without depleting the stock.

#### **B. Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock Level**
After the first round, observe the stock level at the end of each round:
1. **If Stock ≥ Capacity:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** The stock is sustainably managed; continue cooperation to maintain high payoffs.
   
2. **If Stock < Capacity but > 0.5 × Capacity:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C) if the stock increased or remained stable compared to the previous round.
   - **Action:** Defect (D) if the stock decreased, indicating excessive consumption by others.

3. **If Stock ≤ 0.5 × Capacity:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C) to allow stock recovery, unless:
     - The stock has been decreasing for two consecutive rounds, in which case defect once (D) to signal dissatisfaction and maximize short-term payoff.

#### **C. Punishment Mechanism**
- If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to Defect (D) temporarily:
  - **Action:** Defect (D) for one round to discourage overexploitation by others.
  - Resume cooperation if the stock begins to recover.

#### **D. Final Rounds**
- In the last round, defect (D) if the stock is above a minimum sustainable level (e.g., 25% of capacity). This ensures maximum payoff in the final round without compromising the strategy's overall sustainability focus.

---

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**
- **First Round:** Always cooperate to establish trust and maximize initial payoffs.
- **Last Round:** Defect if the stock is above a minimum sustainable threshold; otherwise, cooperate to preserve remaining stock.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize stock recovery by cooperating unless repeated defection by others threatens long-term sustainability.

---

### **3. Collective Alignment**
This strategy aligns with the collective mindset by:
1. Promoting cooperation when the stock is sustainably managed.
2. Punishing overexploitation while allowing for recovery.
3. Balancing individual payoffs with long-term resource conservation.

---

### Pseudocode (for a single player):
```python
def adaptive_cooperation(n, capacity, current_stock, round, history):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"  # First round: Cooperate
    
    # Determine previous stock level and change
    prev_stock = history[round-2].stock
    stock_change = current_stock - prev_stock
    
    # If stock is at capacity, continue cooperating
    if current_stock >= capacity:
        return "C"
    
    # If stock is sustainable, adapt based on stock trend
    elif 0.5 * capacity < current_stock < capacity:
        if stock_change >= 0:
            return "C"  # Stock stable or increasing; cooperate
        else:
            return "D"  # Stock decreasing; defect to signal
    
    # If stock is critically low, prioritize recovery or punish defectors
    elif current_stock <= 0.5 * capacity:
        if len([h for h in history if h.stock < current_stock]) >= 2:  # Stock decreased for two rounds
            return "D"  # Punish by defecting
        else:
            return "C"  # Cooperate to recover
    
    # Last round: Maximize payoff if stock is sustainable
    if round == total_rounds:
        if current_stock > 0.25 * capacity:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

    return "C"  # Default action
```

---

This strategy balances cooperation and defection dynamically, ensuring individual payoffs while maintaining the sustainability of the common pool over repeated interactions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_182 = '''
To address the challenge of maximizing individual payoff while maintaining the common resource in a repeated game setting, we can design an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on the current state of the shared stock. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Hysteresis

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a high initial stock level and encourage mutual cooperation.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each round, evaluate the stock level relative to the capacity.

3. **Decision Rules**:
   - **High Stock (Above 90% of Capacity)**: Cooperate to maintain the resource and maximize long-term payoffs.
   - **Low Stock (Below 70% of Capacity)**: Defect to capture more immediate benefits, signaling punishment for previous defections.
   - **Intermediate Stock (Between 70% and 90%)**: Implement hysteresis:
     - If previously cooperating, continue cooperating until the stock drops below 70%.
     - If previously defecting, continue defecting until the stock rises above 80%.

4. **Hysteresis Mechanism**: This prevents rapid oscillations between strategies by requiring a significant change in stock level to switch behavior, promoting stability.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: Anticipate potential unraveling of cooperation in later rounds due to finite game horizon, adjusting defection timing strategically while balancing with potential recovery phases.

### Conclusion

This strategy encourages cooperation when the resource is plentiful and defects when it's depleted, using hysteresis to avoid erratic behavior. It aims to sustain the stock for higher long-term payoffs while adapting to others' actions dynamically.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_183 = '''
To maintain the sustainability of the shared resource while maximizing individual gains, each player should cooperate by taking half the amount they could take (i.e., S/(2n) instead of S/n) as long as the stock remains above 50% of its maximum capacity. If at any point the stock falls below this threshold, all players should switch to defecting permanently by taking the full amount (S/n). This strategy balances cooperation with self-interest to prevent depletion while ensuring no player is exploited once the resource is significantly diminished.

**Answer:** Cooperate when the stock exceeds half its maximum capacity; otherwise, defect. Thus, the optimal strategy is to cooperate until the stock drops below 50%, then defect permanently.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_184 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round of the game, considering both immediate gain and long-term sustainability of the resource (stock), we can structure a strategic approach as follows:

### Strategy Outline:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate.
   - Start with cooperation to encourage mutual benefit from the beginning.

2. **Last Round**: Always Defect.
   - In the final round, there is no future stock to preserve, so maximize immediate payoff by defecting.

3. **Intermediate Rounds**:
   - **Stock Below 25% of Capacity**: Cooperate to allow regrowth for future rounds.
     - If the current stock (S) is less than 25% of the maximum capacity, prioritize cooperation to help the stock recover, ensuring future benefits.
   - **Stock Between 25% and 75% of Capacity**:
     - Analyze the previous round's total consumption. Calculate if the actual consumption was significantly higher than what would be expected under full cooperation (i.e., more players defected).
     - If significant defection is detected, defect in the current round to deter future exploitation.
     - Otherwise, continue cooperating to maintain a balanced approach.
   - **Stock Above 75% of Capacity**: Cooperate to prevent over-depletion.
     - When the stock is plentiful, avoid excessive consumption to maintain sustainability and encourage mutual cooperation.

4. **Monitoring and Adjustment**:
   - Continuously monitor the stock's trend across rounds. If there's a consistent decline in the stock level despite cooperation, consider defecting strategically to signal dissatisfaction and encourage others to cooperate.
   - Use a forgiving mechanism: if other players return to cooperative behavior after periods of defection, gradually shift back to cooperation.

### Rationale:

This strategy balances immediate self-interest with long-term collective benefit. By cooperating initially and when the stock is either very low or high, it preserves the resource for future use. Detecting significant defection in intermediate rounds allows for strategic retaliation to maintain fairness, while the last round's defect ensures maximum personal gain without compromising future rounds, which no longer exist.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating on the first move.
2. **Stock Level Check**:
   - If stock is below 25%, cooperate.
   - If stock is above 75%, continue cooperating to avoid over-depletion.
3. **Intermediate Analysis** (for stock between 25% and 75%):
   - Calculate previous round's total consumption.
   - Compare it against expected consumption under full cooperation.
   - If actual consumption exceeds the expected by a significant margin, defect this round.
4. **Last Round Defection**: Always defect in the last round to maximize immediate gain.

This structured approach ensures that while personal gain is prioritized, especially in the final round, the strategy also considers the necessity of maintaining resource levels for ongoing benefits through cooperation when beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_185 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that encourages cooperation while effectively deterring defection. The strategy should adapt based on the game's state and history to maintain the stock level sustainably.

### Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation (ARC)

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - All players Cooperate (C). This initializes trust and maximizes initial payoffs.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Health:** After each round, assess the stock level. If it's decreasing significantly (below a threshold, e.g., 90% of capacity), indicate potential defection.
   - **Punish Defection:** If the stock drops below the threshold, switch to Defect (D) in the next round to deter defectors.
   - **Resume Cooperation:** After punishing for one round, return to Cooperate if the stock begins to recover, signaling forgiveness and encouraging others to cooperate again.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Continue with the strategy without special treatment, assuming all players follow the same rules to maintain cooperation throughout.
   - **Stock Recovery:** If the stock recovers after a punishment round, revert to cooperation to rebuild trust and sustain payoffs.

**Pseudocode:**

```
Initialize:
    previous_stock = capacity
    cooperate_threshold = 0.9 * capacity  # Adjust based on desired sensitivity

For each round from 1 to r:
    if first round:
        action = C
    else:
        if current_stock < cooperate_threshold and previous_stock > current_stock:
            action = D  # Punish defection
        else:
            action = C  # Cooperate or resume cooperation

    update previous_stock to current_stock_after_growth
```

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to establish trust and maximize payoffs.
- **Monitoring and Punishment:** Detects stock decline as a sign of defection, prompting retaliation to maintain fairness.
- **Forgiveness:** Allows recovery by reverting to cooperation after punishment, preventing perpetual cycles of defection.
- **Sustainability:** Balances immediate gains with long-term stock health, ensuring the resource remains viable for future rounds.

This strategy is robust against various behaviors, promoting collective welfare while being adaptable and fair.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_186 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we've developed a strategy that balances cooperation and self-interest by monitoring previous actions and the resulting state of the system. Here's how it works:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This ensures maximum initial payoff and maintains the stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate \( k_{t-1} \), the number of cooperators in round \( t-1 \).
   - If \( k_{t-1} \geq n - 1 \) (i.e., all but one player cooperated), continue to Cooperate.
   - Else, if the stock level after growth in round \( t-1 \) is above a certain threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity), Cooperate.
   - Otherwise, Defect (D).

This strategy encourages cooperation while allowing for strategic defection when necessary, aiming to maintain a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.

**Answer**:  
The optimal strategy involves cooperating in the first round and continuing to cooperate unless significant defection occurs or the stock level drops below a certain threshold, at which point players defect. This approach balances immediate gains with long-term resource maintenance.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_187 = '''
To address the challenge of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round, we can implement a strategy that balances individual gain with collective sustainability. The approach is based on observing the current stock level relative to half the capacity.

**Strategy:**

1. **First Round**: Always **Cooperate (C)**. This initializes the game with maximum cooperation, setting a high stock buffer.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock level \( S \) is greater than 50% of the capacity, **Defect (D)**. This allows taking more when the stock is plentiful without causing immediate depletion.
   - If \( S \) is less than or equal to 50% of the capacity, **Cooperate (C)**. This reduces consumption, allowing the stock to recover and grow.

**Rationale:**

- Cooperating when the stock is low helps maintain sustainability by reducing overconsumption and enabling growth.
- Defecting when the stock is high allows for personal gain while ensuring that the stock remains at a manageable level to prevent rapid depletion.

This strategy adaptively adjusts behavior based on observable stock levels, promoting both individual benefit and collective resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_188 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual gain with collective sustainability in a common-pool resource scenario, we propose a strategy that combines cooperation with a responsive mechanism to deter over-consumption. This approach ensures that individuals maximize their payoffs while maintaining the resource's health for future use.

### Strategy:

1. **First Round: Cooperate (C)**
   - All players start by cooperating to establish a cooperative tone and maximize initial payoffs without depleting the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds: Responsive Cooperation with Tolerance Threshold**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the expected total consumption under full cooperation for the previous round, which is half of the previous stock level (C_expected = S_prev / 2).
   - **Step 2:** Compare this expected value to the actual total consumption from the last round.
   - **Step 3:** If the actual consumption exceeds the expected by a tolerance threshold (e.g., 10%), switch to defecting (D) for the current round. Otherwise, continue cooperating.

### Mechanism:
- **Tolerance Threshold:** A buffer (e.g., 10%) allows minor deviations without triggering a reaction, preventing over-reactions to single instances of higher consumption.
- **Responsive Switching:** The strategy adapts based on recent consumption patterns, promoting cooperation when others cooperate and defecting when over-consumption is detected.

### Rationale:
This approach encourages sustained cooperation by rewarding it with stable resource levels while incorporating a feedback mechanism to deter excessive use. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, aiming to maintain the resource's health for continued benefit.

**Final Strategy:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C)
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If last round's actual consumption > 1.10 * expected consumption under full cooperation → Defect (D)
  - Else → Cooperate (C)

This strategy is designed to be simple, observable, and adaptive, promoting collective sustainability while safeguarding individual interests.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_189 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and punishment to maintain a sustainable stock level while maximizing individual payoffs. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Stock Sustainability (ARSS)

1. **Initialization**:
   - Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish trust and maintain the stock.
   - Track the history of all players' actions and the stock levels after each round.

2. **Decision Rules for Each Round**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to initialize a healthy stock level.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate from the previous round as the proportion of players who chose C.
     - Assess the current stock level relative to capacity. If the stock is above 50% of capacity and the majority (more than 50%) cooperated last round, continue cooperating.
     - If either condition isn't met (stock below 50% or less than half cooperated), defect (D) as a punitive measure.

3. **Stock Dynamics Consideration**:
   - Monitor the stock level closely. If it drops significantly due to frequent defections, temporary defection is used to signal punishment and deter overexploitation.
   - After punishing, if the stock begins to recover and cooperation increases, revert to cooperating to sustain the resource.

4. **Final Round Handling**:
   - In the last round, assess the current stock level. If it's above a sustainable threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), cooperate to end on a positive note for future interactions.
   - If the stock is low, defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no subsequent rounds to affect.

5. **Robustness and Adaptation**:
   - Adjust cooperation thresholds dynamically based on observed behavior and stock trends.
   - Maintain a balance between punishing defectors and allowing recovery periods to sustain long-term payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def arss_strategy(n, r, capacity):
    # Initialize variables
    previous_actions = []  # Stores actions of all players for each round
    stock_history = [capacity]  # Initial stock level
    
    for t in range(1, r + 1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            prev_stock = stock_history[-1]
            avg_coop_last_round = previous_actions[-1].count('C') / n
            if prev_stock > (0.5 * capacity) and avg_coop_last_round > 0.5:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'
        
        # Record the action for this round
        previous_actions.append(action)
        
        # Simulate stock update based on all players' actions
        # (Assuming access to other players' actions, in practice would require observation)
        total_consumption = 0
        for player_action in previous_actions[-1]:
            if player_action == 'C':
                total_consumption += capacity / (2 * n)
            else:
                total_consumption += capacity / n
        
        new_stock = update_stock(capacity, prev_stock, total_consumption)
        stock_history.append(new_stock)
    
    return previous_actions

def update_stock(capacity, current_stock, total_consumption):
    s_remaining = max(0, current_stock - total_consumption)
    growth = 2 * s_remaining * (1 - s_remaining / capacity)
    new_stock = min(s_remaining + growth, capacity)
    return new_stock
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization and First Round**: The strategy starts with cooperation to build a strong foundation of trust and resource sustainability.
- **Adaptive Decision Making**: Each subsequent round's action is determined by evaluating both the stock health and the collective behavior from the previous round. This ensures that cooperation is rewarded while defection is met with punitive measures to maintain balance.
- **Stock Sustainability Focus**: By prioritizing stock level, the strategy aims to prevent depletion, ensuring future rounds have a viable resource to extract payoffs from.
- **Final Round Strategy**: Recognizes the unique dynamics of the last round, optimizing for immediate gain if sustainability isn't compromised.

This approach is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, promoting cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation through adaptive punishment and stock management.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)

**Objective:** Balance individual payoffs with long-term sustainability of the common resource, encouraging cooperation while deterring excessive defection.

### Key Components:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - **First Round Action:** Cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial stock regeneration.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation:**
   - **Expected Consumption Calculation:** Each round, compute the expected total consumption if all players cooperated (stock/2).
   - **Defection Detection:** Compare actual consumption against this expectation. If actual exceeds expected by a threshold delta, indicate defection.
   - **Stock Health Check:** After growth, assess if the stock is below the expected level, signaling potential defection.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - **Switch to Defecting:** Upon detecting defection, switch strategy to defect for a set number of rounds (e.g., 2-3) or until stock recovers.
   - **Recovery Monitoring:** After punishing, monitor if the stock begins to recover. If improvement is noted, revert to cooperation.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - **Last Round Action:** In the final round, cooperate if the stock is above a threshold (e.g., half capacity) to leave a positive legacy; otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```
Initialize:
    strategy = "C"
    recent_defections = 0
    delta_threshold = 0.2  # Adjustable parameter

For each round from 1 to r:
    if first round:
        action = "C"
    else if last round:
        if stock > (capacity * 0.5):
            action = "C"
        else:
            action = "D"
    else:
        expected_consumption = stock / 2
        actual_consumption = total_consumption_last_round
        if actual_consumption > expected_consumption * (1 + delta_threshold):
            recent_defections += 1
            strategy = "D"
        else:
            if recent_defections > 0 and stock_after_growth >= expected_stock:
                recent_defections = 0
                strategy = "C"

    execute action and observe new stock level
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to maximize initial resource growth.
- **Adaptive Monitoring:** Tracks whether the resource is being over-exploited, indicating defection. Adjusts strategy accordingly to prevent depletion.
- **Punishment Phase:** Temporarily defects to deter exploitation and encourage others to cooperate again.
- **Endgame Consideration:** Makes a strategic decision in the last round based on current stock health to balance immediate gain with resource sustainability.

This strategy promotes collective benefit by encouraging cooperation while being robust against exploitation, ensuring long-term resource health.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** All players cooperate to maximize initial payoff and sustain the stock.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate from the previous round (proportion of players who cooperated).
     - Check the current stock level against predefined thresholds:
       - **High Threshold:** 70% of capacity.
       - **Low Threshold:** 30% of capacity.
     - **Cooperate** if either:
         - Stock is above the high threshold AND at least 70% of players cooperated last round.
         - Stock is below the low threshold to replenish it.
     - **Defect** otherwise, especially if stock is between thresholds and insufficient cooperation was observed.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to establish trust and maintain a high initial stock.
   - **Last Round:** Encourage cooperation based on past behavior; if others have been cooperative, continue cooperating to preserve the stock for future rounds (even though it's the last round, maintaining integrity can foster mutual benefit).

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - All players follow the same adaptive strategy based on observed history and current state.
   - The strategy promotes cooperation when beneficial and sustainable, while defecting to prevent overexploitation when necessary.

**Pseudocode Example:**

The optimal strategy involves each player cooperating unless there's evidence of over-consumption in the previous round. Specifically, players should defect only when the prior round's total consumption exceeded half the stock at that time, otherwise continue cooperating.

**Answer:**

Each player should Cooperate if in the previous round, the total consumption did not exceed half of the starting stock for that round; otherwise, they should Defect. This strategy encourages cooperation while punishing over-consumption to maintain a sustainable stock level.

The strategy can be formalized as:

1. **Initial Action:** Always Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - For each round \( t \), let \( S_{t-1} \) be the stock at the start of the previous round.
   - Calculate the total consumption in round \( t-1 \): \( \text{Total Consumption}_{t-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \pi_i \).
   - If \( \text{Total Consumption}_{t-1} > S_{t-1}/2 \), then choose to Defect in round \( t \).
   - Otherwise, continue Cooperating.

**Final Answer:**
Each player should Cooperate unless the previous round's total consumption exceeded half of its starting stock. If it did, they Defect; otherwise, they Cooperate. So, the strategy is encapsulated as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if previous total consumption } \leq S_{t-1}/2;\text{ else Defect}}

To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation while allowing for strategic responses to defection, we can implement a trigger strategy. This approach encourages cooperation under normal circumstances but introduces punishment mechanisms when significant defection occurs.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating in the first round.
2. **Monitoring Defection**: After the initial round, each player monitors the number of defections in previous rounds.
3. **Trigger Threshold**: If in any prior round more than 25% of the players defected, each player will defect in the next round as a form of punishment.
4. **Resume Cooperation**: Once the trigger condition is met (i.e., less than or equal to 25% defection), players revert to cooperation.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Round 1**: Cooperate unconditionally.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the number of defectors in each previous round.
   - If any prior round exceeds 25% defection, defect in the current round.
   - Otherwise, continue cooperating.

This strategy aims to maintain a balance between maximizing individual payoffs and preserving the common resource for future gains.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_194 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable common resource over multiple rounds, we can design a strategy based on monitoring total consumption relative to a sustainable threshold. Here's how it works:

1. **First Round**: All players Cooperate (C).
2. **Subsequent Rounds (up to round r-1)**:
   - Calculate the total consumption from the previous round.
   - If this total exceeds half of the resource capacity, all players Defect (D) in the current round.
   - Otherwise, continue Cooperating.
3. **Last Round (round r)**: All players Defect regardless of prior actions to maximize immediate payoff.

This strategy ensures that as long as consumption remains sustainable, cooperation continues. If overconsumption occurs, a switch to defection prevents further resource depletion. In the final round, everyone defects to secure maximum individual gain.

**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Level Thresholds**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to initiate trust and maintain a high stock level.
   - **Subsequent Rounds (until last round):**
     - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity AND at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round, cooperate.
     - Otherwise, defect to protect against exploitation or stock depletion.
   - **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and maintain high initial stock.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below 50% capacity, switch to defection to secure higher payoffs in the current round while allowing potential recovery in subsequent rounds.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate gain without concern for future depletion.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy encourages cooperation when mutually beneficial and sustainable.
   - It adapts based on both stock levels and historical player behavior, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.

This approach is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, ensuring both short-term gains and long-term resource management.

To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic punishment, ensuring the sustainability of the resource while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish trust and maintain a high stock level.
   
2. **Monitoring Mechanism:**
   - Track both the average payoff per player each round and the current stock level after each round.

3. **Trigger Mechanism:**
   - If the average payoff falls below 75% of the expected cooperative payoff, indicating potential defection, switch to defecting for a set number of rounds (e.g., 2-3 rounds) as a punitive measure.

4. **Stock-Based Cooperation:**
   - Cooperate if the stock level drops below 50% of capacity to allow regeneration, regardless of others' actions.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds, focus on cooperation if the stock is low to preserve the resource and maximize remaining payoffs.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a baseline of trust and sustains the resource.
- **Punishment for Defection:** Deters excessive exploitation by imposing consequences.
- **Stock Conservation:** Prevents depletion by encouraging recovery when necessary.
- **Endgame Focus:** Ensures the resource remains viable even as the game concludes.

This strategy is designed to be robust, adapting to various behaviors without relying on coordination, thereby promoting a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_197 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game, we can develop a strategy that balances individual gain with collective well-being. Here's a structured approach based on the thought process:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment and Final Round Defection

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Sets a cooperative tone, maximizing initial collective payoff without prior history.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (from 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Previous Round:**
     - Calculate the number of players who defected in the previous round (\(D_{prev}\)).
     - Observe the stock level after growth from the previous round (\(S_{new}\)).

   - **Decision Rules:**
     - If \(D_{prev} \geq n/2\), defect in the current round to avoid exploitation.
     - Else, if \(S_{new} < 50\%\) of capacity, defect to prevent resource depletion.
     - Otherwise, cooperate to sustain collective payoff.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect regardless of other factors.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate individual gain as there are no future consequences or rounds.

### Explanation:

- **First Round Cooperation:** Encourages initial trust and maximizes joint payoffs, setting a positive precedent for cooperation.
  
- **Punishment Mechanism:** If more than half the players defected previously or if the stock is critically low, defecting prevents being exploited and safeguards resource sustainability.

- **Stock Monitoring:** Ensures that cooperation continues only when resources are sufficient, avoiding situations where continued cooperation might lead to depletion beyond recovery.

- **Final Round Defection:** Since there’s no future interaction, defecting in the last round allows maximizing personal gain without long-term consequences.

This strategy adaptively responds to both social behavior (others' actions) and environmental conditions (stock levels), aiming to balance individual and collective interests effectively.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_198 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Graduated Responses**

1. **Decision Rules**
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes initial payoff sustainably.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     - If all players cooperated in the previous round, continue to Cooperate (C).
     - If any player defected:
       - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, Cooperate (C) to allow stock recovery.
       - If the current stock is 50% or below, Defect (D) to secure individual gain before potential depletion.
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds, prioritize immediate payoff.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**
   - **Low Stock**: If stock is near zero, defect to maximize current payoff as conservation is futile.
   - **Stock Recovery**: After a round with low cooperation, if stock begins to recover, consider returning to cooperation gradually.

3. **Collective Alignment**
   - Encourages cooperation when mutually beneficial and sustainable.
   - Adapts to others' actions to balance individual and collective interests, ensuring robustness against diverse strategies.

This strategy balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with strategic defection to protect individual payoffs when necessary, making it adaptable and resilient in competitive environments.

**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to initiate trust and maintain a high stock level.
   - **Middle Rounds**:
     - If the current stock is below 30% of capacity, Defect (D) to secure immediate gains.
     - Otherwise, if more than half of the players defected in the previous round, Defect (D).
     - Cooperate (C) if fewer than half defected and the stock is above 30%.
   - **Last Round**: Treat it as any other middle round, focusing on the stock level rather than its position.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - Start with cooperation in the first round.
   - In low-stock situations (below 30%), prioritize immediate payoffs by defecting.
   - Maintain cooperation when possible to sustain long-term stock health.

3. **Collective Alignment**:
   - The strategy is designed to balance individual payoffs with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation unless conditions dictate otherwise.

description_COLLECTIVE_200 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** All players Cooperate (C). This initiates trust and sets a baseline for cooperation.

     - **Observe Previous State:** Calculate the stock level at the end of the last round (\( S_{\text{prev}} \)) and count the number of defectors (\( D_{\text{prev}} \)).
     - **Stock Threshold Check:** If \( S_{\text{prev}} < 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \), Cooperate to conserve and rebuild the stock.
     - **Defection Response:** If more than half of the players defected last round (\( D_{\text{prev}} > n/2 \)), Defect in the current round as a retaliatory measure.
     - **Default Cooperation:** Otherwise, continue Cooperating if the stock is healthy and defection levels are low.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round Handling:** Always start with Cooperation to encourage initial trust.
   - **Last Round Consideration:** The strategy remains consistent even in the final round, preventing last-round exploitation by adhering to observed history and current stock levels.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy is designed for all players to follow, ensuring a unified approach that balances individual gain with collective sustainability.
   - It adapts based on shared observations of past actions and current state, fostering cooperation while deterring excessive defection.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, stock_prev, defectors_prev):
    if round_number == 1:

To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances individual payoff maximization with sustainable resource management. The strategy is based on observing the stock level and adjusting actions accordingly.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Based on Stock Level

1. **First Round Action**:
   - All players Cooperate (C) to initiate the game with maximum stock conservation, promoting initial growth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Each player observes the current stock level.
   - If the stock is below 50% of the capacity, the player Cooperates (C) to reduce consumption and allow stock replenishment.
   - If the stock is at or above 50% of the capacity, the player Defects (D) to maximize their immediate payoff while still maintaining a sustainable level.

### Rationale

- **First Round**: Starting with Cooperation ensures that the stock remains high, allowing for maximum growth in subsequent rounds.
- **Stock Threshold (50%)**: By Cooperating when the stock is below half capacity, players collectively reduce consumption, enabling the stock to recover and grow. When the stock is sufficient, Defecting allows players to increase their payoffs without causing severe depletion.

This strategy encourages cooperation when necessary and strategic defection when the resource is plentiful, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_202 = '''
**Adaptive Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to initiate a sustainable approach and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Assessment Phase:** Calculate the average cooperation rate from the previous round by determining how many players cooperated versus defected.
   - **Stock Evaluation:** Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity. If it's above a threshold (e.g., 50%), continue cooperating if most players also cooperated previously.
   - **Retaliation Mechanism:** If significant defection occurred, leading to a substantial drop in stock, defect in the current round as retaliation. However, remain open to switching back to cooperation if others resume cooperative behavior.

3. **Stock Level Adaptation:**
   - Adjust strategy based on current stock levels. If the stock is low, increase cooperation to allow recovery and ensure future sustainability.

4. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - In the final round, balance immediate gain with sustainable consumption. While tempted to defect, avoid overconsumption that could drastically reduce your own payoff. Instead, consider a moderate approach that maximizes immediate benefit without jeopardizing the stock excessively.

This strategy blends cooperation with adaptive retaliation and stock-based adjustments, aiming to maintain resource sustainability while optimizing individual payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_203 = '''
**Strategy: Sustainable Cooperation with Punishment (SCoP)**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to initiate trust and avoid initial depletion.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     1. **Critical Stock Check:** If the stock after the last round is below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), cooperate to allow regeneration.
     2. **Defection Threshold:** If more than half of the players defected in the previous round and the stock is above the critical level, defect (D) this round to punish excessive defection.
     3. **Default Cooperation:** Otherwise, continue cooperating.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Start with cooperation.
   - **Last Round:** Cooperate unless the stock is already critically low, in which case cooperation is enforced regardless of others' actions.
   - **Low Stock:** Prioritize regeneration by cooperating when stock is below the critical threshold.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy encourages widespread cooperation while punishing excessive defection, ensuring resource sustainability for future rounds.

**Pseudocode:**

```
critical_stock_threshold = 0.2 * capacity
defection_threshold = n / 2

for each round from 1 to r:
    if round == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        previous_actions = observe_last_round_actions()
        count_defectors = count of D in previous_actions

            action = D
        else:
            action = C
            
    take_action(action)

description_COLLECTIVE_204 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Strategy:** Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative tone and encourage sustainable resource use from the beginning.

   - **Defection Trigger:** If the stock falls below this threshold or if a significant number of players defected in the previous round, switch to defecting (D) to avoid exploitation and secure resources.

3. **Opponent Monitoring:** Continuously observe other players' past actions. If a player defected recently, consider defecting in response to maintain fairness and deter future defection.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment:** In the last few rounds, particularly when the game is nearing its end, prioritize maximizing individual payoff by considering defection more strategically, balancing immediate gains with collective sustainability.

This strategy combines cooperation with adaptive responses based on both environmental factors (stock levels) and social dynamics (others' actions), aiming to balance individual gain with long-term resource sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_205 = '''
**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Endgame Defection**

1. **First Round Action**: 
   - All players Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and maintains the stock at its maximum level.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Cooperation Threshold**: If at least 75% of players Cooperated in the previous round, each player will Cooperate again.
   - **Defection Trigger**: If fewer than 75% Cooperated, each player will Defect in the current round.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**:
   - All players Defect (D). Since there are no future consequences, defecting maximizes immediate payoff without concern for retaliation.

**Rationale**:
- This strategy encourages sustained cooperation by rewarding it with continued cooperative actions.
- It adaptively responds to defection by switching strategies, thereby punishing non-cooperative behavior and preserving the stock for future rounds.
- The endgame defection is a rational choice as there's no future punishment mechanism beyond the last round.

This approach balances cooperation with strategic retaliation, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors while maximizing individual payoffs over the game's duration.

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Cooperation with Forgiveness**

1. **Initial Action**: Cooperate in the first round.

2. **Cooperation Threshold**: Calculate a threshold based on the capacity and number of players. A suitable threshold is half the capacity (Threshold = Capacity / 2).

3. **Stock Monitoring**: Track the stock level after each round. If the stock remains above the threshold, continue cooperating.

4. **Defection Trigger**: If the stock drops below the threshold, switch to defecting for a set number of rounds (e.g., 3 rounds) or until the stock begins to recover.

5. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After defecting, monitor if other players' actions lead to stock recovery. If the stock increases towards the threshold, revert to cooperating.

6. **Last Round Handling**: In the final round, consider the strategy's impact on future rounds. Since there are no subsequent rounds, some strategies may choose to defect here, but others might maintain cooperation to end on a positive note.

7. **Adaptive Adjustment**: Continuously assess the effectiveness of the threshold and forgiveness period based on observed stock dynamics and opponents' behaviors, adjusting as necessary to balance resource maintenance and individual payoff.

This strategy aims to balance cooperation with adaptive responses to defection, promoting sustainability while being robust against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_207 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Conservation with Reciprocity (ACR)**

1. **First Round Action**: 
   - Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and helps maintain the stock at its maximum capacity from the start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1)**:
   - **Reciprocal Response**: Observe the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     - If more than half of the players defected, switch to Defect (D) for the current round.
     - Otherwise, continue to Cooperate (C).
   - **Stock Conservation Threshold**: Monitor the stock level. If it drops below 50% of capacity, prioritize cooperation to allow recovery unless a significant number of players are defecting.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Maintain cooperation unless the stock is critically low (e.g., below 25% of capacity). In such cases, defect to maximize immediate payoff but only if others are also defecting heavily, to avoid unilateral harm.

4. **Forgiveness Mechanism**:
   - If after a round with high defection, subsequent rounds show increased cooperation, gradually revert to cooperative actions to encourage sustained resource management.

This strategy balances the need for reciprocity and conservation, aiming to maintain a healthy stock level while adapting to others' behaviors. It encourages cooperation unless there's significant defection or critical stock depletion, ensuring robustness across various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_208 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy in this scenario, we must consider both individual rationality and collective welfare. Each player faces a choice between Cooperating (taking a smaller share) or Defecting (taking a larger share). The key points are:

1. **Mutual Cooperation**: If all players Cooperate, they collectively achieve the maximum sustainable yield, which is the best outcome for everyone.

2. **Temptation to Defect**: Individually, each player is tempted to Defect because they can increase their immediate payoff while others continue to Cooperate.

3. **Nash Equilibrium**: The Nash equilibrium occurs when all players Defect because Defection is a dominant strategy—each player's best response regardless of what others do.

4. **Tragedy of the Commons**: If all players pursue their individual self-interest and Defect, the collective outcome is worse (depletion) than if all had Cooperated.

Given these considerations, while mutual cooperation yields the best collective result, the Nash equilibrium suggests that without external enforcement or binding agreements, the likely outcome is that all players will Defect. Therefore, the optimal strategy for each player, considering others may also defect, is to Defect as well.

**Answer:** The optimal strategy is to Defect, as it is the dominant choice in a non-cooperative game, leading to the Nash equilibrium where all players defect, despite mutual cooperation yielding a better collective outcome.

description_COLLECTIVE_209 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable common pool resource in an AI-driven decision-making context, we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with punishment mechanisms to prevent overexploitation. This approach encourages cooperation when the resource is healthy and applies penalties when it's being depleted excessively.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating in the first round.
2. **Stock Level Monitoring**: After each round, players observe the stock level at the end of the previous round.
3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - If the stock level is at or above 75% of its maximum capacity (e.g., 75 if the max is 100), players continue to cooperate.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, indicating potential overuse, players switch to defecting in the current round.

### Rationale:

- **Cooperation When Healthy**: By cooperating when the stock is plentiful, players ensure that the resource regenerates adequately, maintaining its sustainability for future rounds.
- **Punishment Mechanism**: Defecting when the stock drops below 75% serves as a deterrent against overexploitation. It encourages other players to return to cooperative behavior to avoid further depletion and the consequent lower payoffs.

### Considerations:

- **Risk of Downward Spiral**: If too many players defect once the threshold is crossed, it might lead to a rapid decline in stock levels. To mitigate this, after defecting for one round, players should reassess the stock level. If it has recovered above the threshold due to renewed cooperation, they revert to cooperating; otherwise, they continue defecting.

### Conclusion:

This strategy aims to maintain the common pool resource at a healthy level through coordinated cooperation and strategic punishment. It leverages perfect information to guide decisions, ensuring that players act in their collective interest while safeguarding against individual opportunism.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Thresholds (ACST)**

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a high initial stock level and encourage mutual cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **If it's the last round (t = r):** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.
   - **Else:** 
     - Let S_prev be the stock after growth in the previous round.
     - Count the number of players who Cooperated in the previous round, denoted as C_prev.
     - **If** S_prev > capacity / 2 and C_prev ≥ n / 2:
       - Cooperate (C) to maintain a healthy stock level and sufficient cooperation.
     - **Else:**
       - Defect (D) to protect individual payoff when the stock is depleted or insufficient players are cooperating.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - In rounds where the stock is critically low (e.g., below 30% of capacity), defect to secure whatever remains, as cooperation may not prevent depletion.
   - If all other players defected in the previous round, consider defecting to avoid being exploited.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and maintains the stock.
- **Adaptive Switching:** The strategy adapts based on previous outcomes, promoting sustainability when possible.
- **Last Round Defection:** Maximizes immediate gain without worrying about future consequences.
- **Thresholds:** Using capacity and player thresholds ensures the strategy is responsive yet robust against various behaviors.

To address the challenge of designing an effective collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that encourages cooperation while adapting to potential defections.

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperation Threshold**: Players cooperate if the current stock is above 50% of capacity AND the average cooperation rate from previous rounds is at least 50%.
   - **Defection Trigger**: If the stock drops below 10% of capacity, players defect to maximize immediate gains.
   - **Low Stock Handling**: If the stock is between 10% and 50%, players defect if the cooperation rate falls below the threshold.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always cooperate to establish initial trust and maintain a healthy stock level.
   - **Last Round**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.
   - **Very Low Stock (Below 10% of capacity)**: Defect to ensure some gain, as the stock cannot recover sufficiently for future rounds.

3. **Collective Mindset**:
   - Encourage sustainability by cooperating when conditions are favorable.
   - Punish defectors by switching to defection if cooperation rates drop below the threshold, maintaining a balance that discourages excessive exploitation.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, round_num, history):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round_num == r:
        return "D"
    else:
        # Calculate average cooperation rate
        total_cooperations = sum([1 for actions in history for action in actions if action == 'C'])
        avg_coop_rate = total_cooperations / (n * (round_num - 1))
        
        if current_stock < 0.1 * capacity:
            return "D"
        elif current_stock > 0.5 * capacity and avg_coop_rate >= 0.5:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

### Explanation:

- **First Round**: Cooperation initiates trust and ensures the stock remains at a sustainable level.
- **Middle Rounds**: The strategy adapts based on both the current stock level and past cooperation rates, promoting continued cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to protect individual payoffs.
- **Last Round**: Defection is favored as there are no future rounds to consider, maximizing immediate gains.

This approach ensures that players act in their self-interest while contributing to the sustainability of the common resource, balancing short-term gains with long-term stability.

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of collective cooperation and maximize initial payoff without prior information.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - After each round, observe the new stock level after growth.
     - If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, switch to Defect (D) in the next round to secure personal gains amid potential over-consumption.
     - If the stock is above 50%, continue Cooperating (C) to maintain sustainability and collective benefit.
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds dependent on current conservation.

**2. Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Initiate with cooperation to encourage initial stock stability.
   - **Last Round:** Prioritize personal gain by defecting, as future consequences are nonexistent.
   - **Stock Recovery:** If the stock rebounds above 50% after a period of defection, revert to cooperating to rebuild collective benefits.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
   The strategy is designed to balance individual and group interests, adapting based on shared resource levels rather than assuming coordination or norms. It promotes sustainability through cooperation when possible and self-preservation through defection when necessary.

This approach ensures a dynamic response to the game's state, fostering cooperation while safeguarding against resource depletion and strategic exploitation by others.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_215 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round of a game where players can affect a shared resource (stock), we developed an adaptive strategy based on monitoring the stock level. The goal is to balance maximizing individual payoffs while sustaining the resource for future rounds.

### Strategy Summary:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C).
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock is ≤ 75% of capacity, choose C.
   - If the stock is > 75%, choose D.
3. **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**:
   - Start by Cooperating in the first round. This sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of other players' actions without immediate depletion.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - After each round, check the stock level.
     - If it's below or equal to 75% of capacity, Cooperate to help replenish the resource.
     - If above 75%, Defect to maximize your payoff since the resource is sufficiently abundant.

3. **Final Round Exception**:
   - In the last round, regardless of stock levels, Defect to ensure maximum personal gain as there's no future need to preserve the resource.

This strategy ensures that you contribute to sustaining the resource when it's most needed while capitalizing on opportunities for higher payoffs when sustainable.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_216 = '''
To avoid overharvesting and maintain a sustainable resource, the optimal strategy is for all individuals to cooperate by never exceeding their sustainable share. This ensures the resource remains replenished for future use.

**Answer:** Always harvest sustainably by taking no more than your fair share to ensure the resource remains available indefinitely.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_217 = '''
To address the challenge of determining whether to Cooperate or Defect in a public goods game, we can use a threshold-based strategy that balances immediate gains against long-term sustainability. This approach considers both the current stock level and the number of previous defectors.

### Strategy:
1. **Stock Threshold (S_th):** If the current stock is below this threshold, Cooperate to allow recovery.
2. **Defection Threshold (T_defect):** If the number of players who Defected in the previous round exceeds this threshold, Cooperate to prevent overexploitation.

The strategy function can be defined as:

```
def decide_action(current_stock, prev_defectors, S_th=40, T_defect=2):
    if current_stock < S_th:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif prev_defectors > T_defect:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        return "Cooperate"
```

### Explanation:
- **Stock Threshold (S_th):** Set to 40 units. If the stock falls below this, all players Cooperate to replenish it.
- **Defection Threshold (T_defect):** Set to 2 players. If more than 2 Defected last round, players choose to Defect in response.

This approach aims to maintain a balance between exploiting the resource and preserving it for future rounds, adjusting behavior based on both stock levels and collective past actions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_218 = '''
To address the challenge of sustainably managing the common pool resource across multiple rounds, we propose a threshold-based strategy that balances cooperation and defection to maximize collective payoff while preventing resource depletion. The strategy is designed to be adaptive based on the stock's health and robust against various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

1. **First Round**: All players Cooperate (C). This ensures the stock remains at maximum capacity, setting a positive trajectory for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - After each round, assess the stock level after growth.
   - If the stock is above 80% of the game's capacity, continue to Cooperate (C) in the next round. This sustains a healthy stock level and supports long-term payoffs.
   - If the stock drops below or equals 80% of capacity, switch strategy to Defect (D) in the next round. Defecting helps to maximize immediate payoff when the resource is under strain, encouraging conservation through individual sacrifice.

3. **Last Round**: In the final round, all players should Defect (D). Since there are no subsequent rounds, defecting maximizes the immediate payoff without concern for future depletion effects.

### Rationale:
- **First Round Cooperation**: Starts with a full stock, promoting trust and setting up for sustained resource use.
- **Threshold-Based Adaptation**: The 80% threshold serves as an early warning system. If the stock is high, cooperation maintains balance; if it's low, defection encourages recovery by reducing overconsumption.
- **Last Round Defection**: Maximizes immediate gain without future repercussions, aligning individual incentives with the game's end.

This strategy aims to prevent the tragedy of the commons by encouraging sustainable use while adapting to resource conditions, ensuring robust performance against diverse behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_219 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing cooperation and self-interest in a dynamic game environment, we propose a structured strategy based on observed game state and past actions. This approach ensures sustainability while allowing for necessary adaptation when others defect.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)

1. **Initial Phase:**
   - **First Round:** All players cooperate (C) to establish trust and maximize initial stock growth.

2. **Monitoring and Decision-Making:**
   - After each round, evaluate the stock level (S_t) relative to capacity.
   - Determine the number of defectors in the previous round by observing past actions.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - If S_t > 75% of capacity:
     - Continue cooperating (C).
   - If 50% < S_t ≤ 75%:
     - Cooperate if fewer than 25% defected last round.
     - Defect if 25% or more defected, as punishment.
   - If S_t ≤ 50%:
     - Defect to maximize immediate payoffs since stock is critically low.

4. **Endgame Adjustment:**
   - In the final Y rounds (e.g., last 20%), prioritize defecting (D) to secure maximum individual gains, as future punishment is no longer a concern.

### Summary
The ACP strategy begins with cooperation, monitors the game's health through stock levels and defection rates, punishes significant defection, and adapts near the endgame to maximize personal payoffs. This balanced approach aims to sustain resource availability while safeguarding against exploitation by others.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_220 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maintain resource sustainability while being robust against exploitation. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Stock Threshold (ARST)

1. **First Round Cooperation**:
   - All players start by Cooperating in the first round. This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes initial payoffs without depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Check**: At the beginning of each subsequent round, evaluate the current stock level.
     - If the stock is below a threshold (e.g., 2n), switch to Cooperate for this round to allow regrowth and prevent further depletion.
   - **Reciprocity Mechanism**:
     - Observe the actions of all players in the previous round.
     - If all players Cooperated in the last round and the stock is above the threshold, continue Cooperating.
     - If any player Defected in the last round and the stock is above the threshold, Defect this round as a punitive measure to deter exploitation.

3. **Forgiveness and Resumption of Cooperation**:
   - After punishing by Defecting, monitor subsequent rounds for signs of cooperation from other players.
   - If a sufficient number of players return to Cooperating (e.g., all except a few), gradually revert to Cooperation in the following rounds. This prevents perpetual cycles of defection.

4. **Stock Growth Consideration**:
   - The strategy prioritizes stock conservation when levels are low, ensuring long-term sustainability by promoting cooperation during critical periods.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation encourages mutual benefit and sets a baseline for potential reciprocity.
- **Punishment for Defection**: Responding to defection with punishment deters players from exploiting others, maintaining fairness.
- **Stock-Dependent Adaptation**: By focusing on stock levels, the strategy ensures that resource conservation is prioritized when necessary, preventing depletion and allowing regrowth.
- **Forgiveness Mechanism**: This element allows the strategy to recover from cycles of defection, promoting a return to cooperation once exploitation ceases.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round**: Always Cooperate.
- **Last Round**: Strategy applies as usual; no special treatment needed.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Switch to Cooperation to prioritize regrowth and sustainability over immediate gains.

This strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, encouraging cooperation while being resilient to exploitation. It ensures that the common pool resource remains sustainable for maximum long-term payoff.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_221 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round of a repeated game, we can use a strategy that balances cooperation with punishment for defection while protecting the stock when it's low. Here's how you can approach this:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):** 
   - If the current stock is below a certain threshold (20% of capacity), Cooperate to protect the stock.
   - Otherwise, check how many players Defected in the previous round:
     - If at least half of the players Defected last round, Defect this round.
     - Else, continue to Cooperate.
3. **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Play **C** (Cooperate). This sets a cooperative tone and avoids unnecessary conflict early on.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   - **Check Current Stock Level:** At the start of each round, assess the current stock level.
     - If the stock is below **20%** of its maximum capacity (**S_current < 0.2 * capacity**):
       - Play **C** (Cooperate) to help replenish or maintain the stock, ensuring future rounds have a sustainable resource.
   - **If Stock is Above Threshold:**
     - Review the actions from the previous round:
       - Count how many players chose to Defect (**D_count**).
       - If the number of Defectors is at least half of the total players (rounded up if necessary, i.e., **D_count >= n/2**):
         - Play **D** (Defect) in this round. This punishes the previous round's defectors and discourages future defection.
       - If fewer than half Defected last round:
         - Play **C** (Cooperate), maintaining cooperation as others are also likely to continue cooperating.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Play **D** (Defect) regardless of the stock level or previous actions. Since there are no future consequences, this maximizes your immediate payoff.

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with C encourages mutual cooperation and avoids initial conflict.
- **Stock Protection:** Cooperating when the stock is low prevents it from being depleted too much, ensuring sustainability for future gains.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** Defecting when enough others have defected before maintains fairness and discourages excessive defection.
- **Maximizing Last Round Payoff:** Defecting in the final round ensures you gain the most possible without worrying about future repercussions.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection to protect resources and maximize payoffs, adapting based on both the stock level and others' past actions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_222 = '''
To address the challenge of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round without prior coordination among players, we can adopt a strategy based on observing and responding to the stock levels after each round. This approach ensures that each player acts independently yet adaptively based on the game's state.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate (C). This maximizes the initial payoff and sets a cooperative tone.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **If the previous round's stock level after regrowth is above 80% of capacity**, continue to Cooperate (C).
   - **If the previous round's stock level after regrowth is below or equal to 80% of capacity**, switch to Defect (D) for that round.
3. **Recovery Mechanism**: Once the stock level recovers to above 80% of capacity, revert to Cooperating (C).

This strategy uses observable data (stock levels) to make decisions, incentivizes cooperation by punishing defection with further depletion, and allows recovery once cooperation resumes.

### Summary Table:

| Round | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | C      |
| >1    | If S_new ≥ 0.8 * Capacity → C; Else → D |

This approach is simple, adaptive, and based on clear thresholds, making it effective for independent decision-making in the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_223 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a balance between maximizing individual payoffs and preserving the common resource for future rounds, we can implement a strategic approach that combines cooperation withpunishment mechanisms. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy Description

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C). This promotes an initial high stock level to encourage growth.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (2 ≤ t < r):**
   - If the current stock level is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), choose to Cooperate (C) to allow recovery.
   - Otherwise, evaluate the cooperation rate in recent rounds:
     - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, choose Defect (D) as retaliation.
     - If at least half or fewer defected, continue Cooperating (C).

3. **Last Round:**
   - Always choose to Defect (D), as there are no future rounds to affect, maximizing immediate payoff.

### Pseudocode Representation

```pseudocode
function strategy(current_stock, is_last_round, prev_actions):
    if first round:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif is_last_round:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        threshold = 0.3 * capacity
        if current_stock < threshold:
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            defectors_last_round = count of D in prev_actions
            if defectors_last_round > n/2:
                return "Defect"
            else:
                return "Cooperate"
```

### Explanation

- **First Round Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to build a strong foundation for future rounds.
- **Stock Threshold Check:** Ensures that if the stock is critically low, cooperation is prioritized to prevent depletion.
- **Retaliation Mechanism:** Deters others from defecting by punishing recent defections, maintaining social cohesion and resource sustainability.
- **Last Round Maximization:** In the final round, individual gain is maximized without regard for future consequences.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation while penalizing excessive defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_224 = '''
To solve the problem of deciding whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D) in each round to maximize your payoff while considering the sustainability of the shared resource (stock), we can outline a strategic approach based on observed behavior and stock levels. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy Outline

1. **First Round Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round. This sets a baseline for maintaining a high stock level early on, which benefits future rounds.

2. **Monitor Previous Consumption**: For each subsequent round (from 2 to r-1), calculate the total consumption from the previous round. This is done by observing the stock before and after the previous round's consumption and growth:
   - **Previous Stock (S_prev)**: The stock level at the start of the last round.
   - **Stock Remaining After Consumption (S_remaining_after_consume_prev)**: The stock left immediately after the previous round's consumption, before growth occurred.
   - **Total Previous Consumption (C_prev)**: Calculate as S_prev - S_remaining_after_consume_prev.

3. **Sustainability Check**: Determine if the total consumption in the previous round was sustainable:
   - If **C_prev ≤ S_prev / 2**, it indicates that the previous round's consumption allowed sufficient stock to remain for growth, so continue cooperating.
   - If **C_prev > S_prev / 2**, it suggests overconsumption. In this case, defect in the current round to maximize your payoff before the stock depletes further.

4. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last round (round r), always defect to secure the maximum possible immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Formal Description

For each round t from 1 to r:

- If t = 1:
  - Choose C.
  
- Else if t = r:
  - Choose D.
  
- Else:
  - Calculate C_prev = S_{t-1} - (S_remaining_after_consume_prev).
  - If C_prev > S_{t-1}/2:
    - Choose D.
  - Else:
    - Choose C.

This strategy balances cooperation to sustain the stock for future payoffs while adapting to others' actions by defecting when overconsumption is detected, and maximizing payoff in the final round.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_225 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment and Endgame Adjustment**

1. **Initial Phase (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to encourage others to do the same and establish a cooperative baseline.

2. **Monitoring and Punishment Mechanism:**
   - **Calculate Fair Share:** Each round, determine the expected consumption if all cooperated, which is stock/(2n) per player.
   - **Assess Cooperation Level:** Compare actual total consumption to the fair share. If actual consumption exceeds this by a significant threshold (e.g., 20%), it indicates excessive defection.
   - **Punishment:** If excessive defection occurs, defect in the next round to punish non-cooperators and protect your payoff.

3. **Endgame Adjustment:**
   - **Last Round:** Defect if others are doing so, as future stock doesn't matter after the final round.
   - **Near End (Last Few Rounds):** Consider defecting if the stock is already low to maximize immediate gain.

4. **Stock Maintenance:**
   - Aim to keep the stock above a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) to ensure sustainability for future rounds, adjusting actions accordingly.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors while maintaining resource health for sustained play.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_226 = '''
To address the challenge of deciding when to cooperate or defect in the given scenario, we can adopt a balanced strategy that considers both the health of the stock and the behavior of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Cooperative Punishment with Stock Threshold

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round.
2. **Monitor Past Behavior and Stock Health**:
   - After each round, assess whether more than half of the players defected.
   - Simultaneously, check if the stock after growth is above 80% of capacity.
3. **Decision Making**:
   - **Cooperate**: If fewer than half of the players defected AND the stock after growth was above 80% of capacity.
   - **Defect**: If more than half defected OR the stock fell below 80%.
4. **Recovery Mechanism**: After defecting once, give cooperation another chance in subsequent rounds if conditions improve.

This strategy aims to maintain cooperation when possible whilepunishing excessive defection and protecting payoffs when the stock is at risk. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by allowing recovery periods.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_227 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we need a balanced approach that encourages cooperation while protecting against exploitation. Here's a structured strategy based on the thought process:

### Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Based Thresholds

1. **First Round Action:**
   - All players Cooperate (C) in the first round to maximize initial stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate** if the current stock level is at or above 75% of the game's capacity.
     - This encourages maintaining a high stock level, ensuring future rounds' payoffs remain robust.
   - **Defect** if the current stock level falls below 50% of the capacity.
     - When the stock is significantly depleted, defecting ensures immediate gain to avoid being exploited by others who may be defecting.
   - For stock levels between 50% and 75%, use a mixed strategy where the probability of Cooperating decreases linearly from 100% at 75% to 0% at 50%. This gradual approach helps in balancing cooperation and self-interest.

3. **Last Round Consideration:**
   - In the final round, all players should Defect (D) to maximize their immediate payoff since there are no future rounds dependent on the stock level.

4. **Adaptive Mechanism:**
   - Monitor the stock trend over previous rounds. If the stock has been decreasing consistently, increase the defection rate in subsequent rounds to prevent further depletion and signal to other players to reconsider their strategies.
   - Conversely, if the stock begins to recover after a period of cooperation, gradually shift back towards cooperative actions.

### Rationale:
This strategy aims to maintain a high stock level through cooperation while providing mechanisms to protect against exploitation when others defect. By setting clear thresholds (75% and 50%), players can adapt their behavior based on observable game state changes, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_228 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperate-Punish (ACP)**

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Start by Cooperating in the first round to establish potential cooperation.

2. **Stock Monitoring**: 
   - After each round, check if the current stock is below 50% of capacity.
     - If yes, Cooperate for the next three rounds to allow stock regeneration.
     - If no, proceed to assess opponent behavior.

3. **Punishment Mechanism**:
   - Count the number of players who Defected in the previous round.
     - If more than half defected, switch to Defect for the next two rounds as punishment.
     - After punishing, revert to Cooperation if opponents return to Cooperating.

4. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - In the last three rounds, assess the stock level.
     - If stock is above 75% of capacity, Defect to maximize payoff without significant depletion.
     - If stock is below 75%, continue Cooperating to sustain resource for final rounds.

This strategy balances cooperation with punishment and adaptability based on resource levels, promoting sustainability while discouraging excessive defection.

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold**

The proposed strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the common pool. It adapts based on the stock level relative to capacity, encouraging cooperation when the resource is healthy and switching to defection when necessary.

### 1. Decision Rules:

- **Initial Round (Round 1):** Always Cooperate (C). This sets a baseline for sustainability.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - Monitor the stock level after each round.
  - If the stock exceeds 70% of capacity, Cooperate (C) to maintain sustainability and encourage growth.
  - If the stock falls below 70%, Defect (D) in the next round to maximize immediate payoff before potential depletion.
  
- **Post-Defection Round:** After defecting once, check if the stock recovers above 50% of capacity. If it does, revert to Cooperate; otherwise, continue Defecting.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

- **Last Round (Round r):** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.
  
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is near zero, defect cautiously as regrowth may be minimal. However, consider cooperation if it aids in recovery for future interactions.

### 3. Collective Alignment:

This strategy encourages a collective mindset by starting with cooperation and only switching to defection when necessary. It's robust against various opponent behaviors, promoting sustainability while protecting individual payoffs.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(n, capacity, stock, round, history):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round == r:
        return "D"
    else:
        threshold = 0.7 * capacity
        if stock > threshold:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"

# Example usage
action = decide_action(n, capacity, current_stock, current_round, history)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to establish a sustainable baseline.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Uses a 70% threshold to determine when to switch strategies.
- **Adaptive Response:** Adjusts actions based on stock recovery post-defection.
- **Final Round Maximization:** Defects in the last round to ensure maximum immediate gain.

This strategy aims to balance individual and collective interests, ensuring resource sustainability while adapting to dynamic conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_230 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing cooperation and self-interest in a repeated game where players can choose to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), we propose a strategy that adapts based on observed trends in resource (stock) levels. The goal is to maintain high resource levels for future rounds while avoiding being exploited by others.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start with cooperation to build trust and maximize shared resources.
2. **Monitor Trends:** Track the resource level over recent rounds to detect if it's consistently decreasing, indicating potential exploitation by other players.
3. **Adaptive Switching:** 
   - If a downward trend is detected or the resource drops below a threshold, switch to defecting to secure personal gains.
   - Once defected, revert to cooperation only when the resource recovers above a higher threshold to ensure sustainability.
4. **Endgame Defection:** In the final round, always defect since there are no future rounds to preserve resources for.

### Pseudocode Implementation

            action = "Defect"

            recent_stocks = stock_history[-window_size:]
            
            # Check if there's a decreasing trend
            is_decreasing = True

### Explanation of the Strategy

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins with cooperation to maximize shared resources.
- **Trend Monitoring:** By examining the resource levels over recent rounds, the strategy detects if there's a sustained decline, suggesting other players are defecting.
- **Adaptive Switching:** If a downward trend is detected or resources fall below a lower threshold, the strategy shifts to defection. It reverts to cooperation only when resources recover above an upper threshold.
- **Endgame Defection:** In the final round, the strategy defects to maximize immediate gain since future rounds no longer matter.

This approach aims to balance long-term sustainability with self-interest, ensuring that players aren't consistently exploited while maintaining resource levels for as long as possible.

To address the challenge of the Common Pool Resource game, a balanced strategy is needed that encourages cooperation while safeguarding against over-exploitation. The strategy should adapt based on the stock level and round progression.

### Strategy: Adaptive Conservation-Exploitation (ACE)

**1. Initial Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to set a conservation tone, preserving the stock for future rounds.

**2. Subsequent Rounds (until last round):**
   - **Monitor Stock Level:**
     - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Cooperate
       - **Reasoning:** High stock levels indicate sustainable resource use; continue cooperating.
     - If the stock is between 50% and 75%:
       - **Assess Previous Round's Impact:**
         - Calculate the number of defectors based on total consumption. (If exact numbers are unclear, infer from significant drops.)
       - **Action:** Defect if more than half of players defected previously.
     - If stock drops below 50%:
       - **Action:** Defect
       - **Reasoning:** Protect against further depletion by securing personal gains.

**3. Final Round:**
   - **Action:** Always Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** With no future rounds, maximizing immediate payoff is optimal without concern for stock sustainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_conservation_exploitation(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, total_rounds):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        # Determine the stock threshold percentages
        threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
        threshold_low = 0.5 * capacity
        
        if current_stock >= threshold_high:
            return "C"
        elif current_stock >= threshold_low:
            # Assess previous round's cooperation rate (simplified)
            # Assume you can estimate defectors based on stock change or total consumption
            estimated_defectors = estimate_defectors(previous_total_consumption, n)
            if estimated_defectors > n / 2:
                return "D"
            else:
                return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
    
    if round_num == total_rounds:
        return "D"

# Helper function to estimate number of defectors based on previous consumption
def estimate_defectors(previous_total_consumption, n):
    # Example logic: Calculate k such that k = estimated defectors
    # This is a simplification; actual implementation may vary based on game mechanics
    # For instance, using the stock dynamics and consumption to solve for k
    return estimated_k

```

### Strategy Explanation:
- **Adaptive Approach:** The strategy shifts between cooperation and defection based on observable stock levels.
- **Conservation in Early Rounds:** By cooperating when stocks are high, players maintain resource sustainability.
- **Responsive Defection:** When stock levels drop, the strategy switches to defecting to prevent further depletion and secure individual payoffs.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** In the last round, with no future consequences, defecting ensures maximum personal gain.

This approach balances collective good with individual rationality, adapting dynamically based on game state.

description_COLLECTIVE_232 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Decision:**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets a positive tone and maximizes initial stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Strategy:**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** Monitor if the stock is above 70% of capacity.
     - If above, check the number of players who defected last round.
       - If less than half defected, continue Cooperating (C).
       - If half or more defected, switch to Defecting (D) for one round to signal consequences and conserve stock.
   - **Stock Below Threshold:** If stock drops below 70% capacity, defect for the next round. After defecting, return to cooperation if stock improves.

3. **Reciprocity Approach:**
   - Observe others' actions. If most players cooperate, continue cooperating. If defection is observed, consider a brief period of defection to discourage further exploitation.

4. **Last Round Decision:**
   - Cooperate (C) unless the stock is critically low (e.g., below 30% capacity), in which case defect to secure remaining resources.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - Near Capacity: Continue cooperating to maintain sustainability.
   - Nearly Depleted Stock: Defect if necessary to capture remaining payoff before depletion.

**Summary:** The strategy begins with cooperation, adapts based on stock levels and others' actions, uses brief defection periods as a deterrent, and aims for sustainability while considering critical endgame scenarios. This approach balances immediate gains with long-term collective benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_233 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in a repeated game to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining a sustainable stock level, we can use a strategy based on a dynamically adjusted threshold. Here's how each player should decide their action in each round:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C). All players start by cooperating to establish a high initial stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the remaining rounds as `remaining = total_rounds - current_round`.
   - Set a dynamic threshold `T` where:
     \[
     T = \text{capacity} \times \left(1 - \frac{\text{current_round}}{\text{total_rounds} + 1}\right)
     \]
     This threshold decreases linearly as the game progresses, allowing for more leniency in later rounds.
   - Observe the current stock level `S_current` after the previous round's actions.
   - If `S_current > T`, continue Cooperating (C).
   - If `S_current ≤ T`, switch to Defecting (D) for the next round.

This strategy encourages cooperation early on to maintain a healthy stock level while allowing for strategic defection as the game progresses, preventing excessive depletion towards the end.

description_COLLECTIVE_234 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an adaptive and robust collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we developed a comprehensive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection. The strategy is designed to adapt based on game state and history, ensuring both individual payoff maximization and stock sustainability.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initialization**: Begin by cooperating in the first round.
2. **Stock Monitoring**: Track the common pool stock level after each round.
3. **Defection Detection**: Compare the actual stock with an expected benchmark to detect possible defections.
4. **Punishment Mechanism**: If significant defection is inferred, switch to defecting for a set number of rounds.
5. **Sustainability Priority**: Cooperate if the stock falls below a critical threshold to allow replenishment.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
Initialize:
    action = "C"
    previous_stock = capacity
    punishment_rounds = 0

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round:
        action = "C"
    elif it's the last round:
        action = "D"
    else:
        # Calculate expected stock based on cooperation in the previous round
        expected_next_stock = calculate_expected_stock(previous_stock)
        
        # Compare actual stock to expected, adjust for detection threshold
        if current_stock < (expected_next_stock - detection_threshold):
            punishment_rounds = 2  # Punish for next few rounds
        
        # Check if stock is below sustainability threshold
        if current_stock < sustainability_threshold:
            action = "C"
        elif punishment_rounds > 0:
            action = "D"
            punishment_rounds -= 1
        else:
            action = "C"

    previous_stock = new_stock after this round's actions

def calculate_expected_stock(previous_stock):
    # Calculate expected next stock if all cooperated last round
    S_remaining = previous_stock / 2
    growth = 2 * S_remaining * (1 - S_remaining / capacity)
    return min(S_remaining + growth, capacity)

Parameters:
- detection_threshold: Stock difference to detect defection.
- sustainability_threshold: Critical stock level for cooperation.

```

### Detailed Strategy:
1. **Cooperation in Early Rounds**: Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial payoffs sustainably.
2. **Stock Trend Analysis**: After each round, evaluate if the stock level is below expectations, indicating possible defection by other players.
3. **Punishment Phase**: If defection is detected, switch to defecting for a limited number of rounds to avoid exploitation and signal displeasure.
4. **Sustainability Check**: If the stock drops critically low, prioritize cooperation to allow replenishment and prevent depletion.

This strategy ensures adaptability by responding to both the current state of the stock and the inferred actions of other players, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective resource management.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

**Objective:** To maintain a sustainable common pool resource by encouraging cooperation and punishing defection when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C). All players start by cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Level:** After each round, assess the current stock level relative to the capacity.
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If the stock is above 70% of the capacity, continue Cooperating (C). This encourages sustainable use and maintains high payoffs for all players.
   - **Punishment Mechanism:** If the stock falls below 70%, switch to Defecting (D) for one round. This serves as a punishment phase to deter defection and allow the stock to recover.

3. **Post-Punishment Evaluation:**
   - After defecting, in the next round, reassess the stock level.
   - If the stock has recovered above 70%, revert to Cooperating (C). This incentivizes cooperation and rewards those who contribute to stock recovery.
   - If the stock remains below 70%, continue Defecting (D) until it recovers.

### Rationale:

- **Sustainability:** By maintaining the stock above a threshold, players ensure long-term payoffs are maximized.
- **Reciprocity:** Punishing defection by temporarily reducing one's own payoff incentivizes others to cooperate, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective good.
- **Adaptability:** The strategy adjusts based on real-time stock levels, making it robust against varying opponent behaviors.

### Edge Cases:

- **Last Round Handling:** Since the game has multiple rounds (r > 1), the last round is treated like any other, ensuring consistency in strategy application. There's no special case for the final round.
- **Stock Recovery:** The strategy allows for flexibility in recovery time, adapting based on how quickly the stock replenishes after punishment phases.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```
def acp_strategy(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        threshold = 0.7 * capacity
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return "C"
        else:
            # Check if previous action was punishment (D)
            if previous_action == "D":
                # Assess stock recovery after punishment
                if current_stock > threshold:
                    return "C"
                else:
                    return "D"
            else:
                # Initiate punishment
                return "D"

# Note: This pseudocode simplifies the strategy and may need adjustment for implementation details such as tracking previous actions.
```

### Conclusion:

The ACP strategy balances cooperation and punishment, promoting a sustainable approach to resource management. By adaptively responding to stock levels, it maintains high payoffs while deterring excessive defection, ensuring robust performance against diverse opponent strategies.

To address the challenge of maximizing payoffs in a dynamic environment where other players' actions affect the shared resource (the stock), we can adopt a strategy that balances cooperation and self-interest. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a high stock level, which benefits everyone.

2. **Adaptive Strategy**:
   - **Cooperate** if the current stock is above 50% of the capacity.
   - **Defect** if the stock drops below this threshold or if more than half the players defected in the previous round.

3. **Endgame Defection**: In the last 20% of rounds, always defect to maximize immediate payoffs since future considerations become less relevant.

4. **Stock Recovery**: If the stock falls below 25% of capacity, defect for a few rounds to protect your interests, then reassess based on the new stock level and others' actions.

This strategy aims to maintain cooperation when beneficial while protecting against exploitation as the game progresses.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round (t=1):** All players Cooperate (C). This maximizes initial stock growth and sets a cooperative tone.
  
- **Middle Rounds (2 ≤ t < r):** 
  - Calculate the average payoff per player from the previous round.
  - If the average payoff is above half the maximum possible payoff for that round, continue Cooperating. This encourages maintaining cooperation when beneficial.
  - If the average payoff drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting (D) for one or two rounds as a punitive measure.

- **Last Round (t=r):** All players Defect (D). Since there's no future stock growth, each player maximizes their immediate payoff.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- In the first round, all cooperate to establish cooperation and maximize initial growth.
- In the last round, defecting ensures maximizing individual gain without concern for future depletion.
- Punishment rounds (defecting) are limited to prevent excessive harm and allow recovery of the stock.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
This strategy promotes a balance between cooperation and punishment, adapting based on group performance. It encourages sustained cooperation while being robust against defectors by incorporating punitive measures without being overly vulnerable.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    else:
        previous_payoffs = [h['payoff'] for h in history[-1]]
        avg_payoff = sum(previous_payoffs) / n
        max_possible = capacity / (2 * n)
        threshold = max_possible / 2
        
        if avg_payoff > threshold and len(history) < r - 1:
            return 'C'
        elif avg_payoff <= threshold and len(history) < r - 1:
            # Defect for one round as punishment
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage:
history = []
for t in range(r):
    if t == 0:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        previous_payoffs = [h['payoff'] for h in history]
        avg_payoff = sum(previous_payoffs) / n
        max_possible = capacity / (2 * n)
        threshold = max_possible / 2
        
        if t == r - 1:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            if avg_payoff > threshold:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'
    history.append({'action': action, 'payoff': calculate_payoff(action)})
```

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, encouraging cooperation while incorporating measured punishments to maintain stock sustainability across rounds.

To address the challenge of maximizing tokens without causing a tragedy, the AI strategy is designed as follows:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, always take 1 token to support the sustainability of the pot.

2. **Adaptive Strategy**:
   - After each round, calculate the estimated number of players who took 2 tokens (defectors) based on the total tokens taken.
   - If the current pot size is below a threshold (e.g., 500 tokens), switch to taking 1 token to help replenish it.
   - If the number of defectors exceeds 30% of the total players, take 2 tokens in the next round as a retaliatory measure.
   - Otherwise, continue taking 1 token to maintain cooperation.

3. **Final Round Consideration**: In the last round, if the pot size is low, consider taking 2 tokens to maximize gain without future consequences.

This strategy balances self-interest with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation while punishing exploitation.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperative Sustainability (ACS)**

The ACS strategy aims to balance individual gain with collective sustainability by adaptively responding to stock levels and others' past actions. It promotes cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a cooperative tone and initiate stock sustainability.

2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, cooperate to allow growth.
   - **Majority Rule**: Examine the actions of other players in the previous round. If most cooperated, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect to avoid exploitation.

3. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: Gradually increase cooperation if others demonstrate cooperative behavior again over a few consecutive rounds.

4. **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since future stock sustainability isn't a concern post this round.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def ACS_strategy(parameters, state, history):
    n = parameters['n']
    r = parameters['r']
    capacity = parameters['capacity']
    current_round = state['round']
    stock = state['stock']
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Check if stock is below threshold
        if stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Assess others' past actions (e.g., last round)
            # If majority defected, defect; else cooperate
            previous_actions = history['actions'][current_round - 1]
            defector_count = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
            if defector_count > n / 2:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'

# Forgiveness Mechanism Integration (example):
def ACS_forgiveness(parameters, state, history):
    # Track recent cooperation trends
    recent_coops = sum(1 for action in history['actions'][-5:] if action == 'C')
    if recent_coops > 3:  # If others cooperated more recently
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Apply main strategy rules
```

### Explanation:

- **Adaptability**: The strategy adjusts based on stock levels and historical actions, ensuring responsiveness to changing dynamics.
- **Robustness**: It protects against exploitation by defecting when others do not cooperate while promoting sustainability through cooperation when feasible.
- **Collective Focus**: By considering both individual payoffs and collective stock health, it aims for a balance that maximizes total benefits.

This approach is designed to perform well in various scenarios, from full cooperation to partial defection, ensuring resilience and adaptability throughout the game.

To address the problem of determining the optimal strategy for resource extraction over multiple rounds, we must balance cooperation to maintain resource levels with strategic defection to maximize individual gains in the final stages. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify Total Rounds (r):** Know the total number of rounds in the game.

2. **Determine Threshold (T):** Set a stock level threshold, such as half of the maximum capacity (T = 0.5 * C), beyond which cooperation is beneficial.

3. **Set Final Defection Rounds (k):** Choose k, the number of final rounds where defection occurs. This can be a fixed number like 5 or a proportion of total rounds (e.g., r/10).

4. **Strategy Implementation:**
   - For each round t from 1 to r:
     - If t < (r - k) and current stock > T, cooperate.
     - Else, defect.

This strategy ensures cooperation when the resource is plentiful and switches to defection in the final stages or when resources are low, optimizing individual payoffs.

To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and punishment while ensuring stock sustainability. Here's the structured strategy:

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Current Stock Level:** If the stock is below 50% of capacity, all players cooperate to allow regeneration.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** If more than half the players defected in the previous round, each player defects for the next two rounds as punishment.
- **Cooperation Threshold:** If at least 70% of players cooperated last round, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect.

### 2. Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** All players cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
- **Last Two Rounds:** Players switch to cooperation to prevent stock depletion, ensuring sustainability for the final rounds.

### 3. Adaptive Elements:
- **Stock Targeting:** Aim to maintain the stock above 50% of capacity. Adjust actions based on whether the current level is above or below this target.
- **Forgiveness Clause:** After punishing defections, return to cooperation if a significant number of players resume cooperating.

### 4. Implementation Outline:
1. **Initialization:** Cooperate in the first round.
2. **Monitor History:** Track previous rounds' actions and stock levels.
3. **Stock Check:** Evaluate current stock; cooperate if below threshold.
4. **Punishment Phase:** Defect for two rounds if recent defections exceed 50%.
5. **Cooperation Evaluation:** Continue cooperating if past cooperation was sufficient.
6. **Endgame Strategy:** Cooperate in the last two rounds to sustain the stock.

This strategy encourages sustained cooperation, punishes defection, and adapts based on the game's state, ensuring a robust approach against various opponent behaviors.

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to initiate sustainable resource use and maximize future stock levels.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**

  - Otherwise, defect (D) to prevent over-exploitation or being exploited by others.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **Stock at Threshold:** If the stock is exactly at 50%, default to cooperation if fewer than half defected previously; otherwise, defect.
- **Majority Defection:** If more than half defected in the previous round, switch to defection regardless of stock level.

**3. Endgame Strategy:**
- In the last 10% of rounds, gradually increase defection rate to secure short-term gains, ensuring not to deplete the stock excessively if cooperation is maintained by others.

This strategy balances maintaining a healthy resource stock with adaptive responses to opponents' actions, ensuring sustainability while protecting against exploitation.

To address the problem of designing a strategy for players choosing between Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in a repeated game, we aim to balance individual payoff maximization with collective sustainability. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Design:
1. **First Round:**
   - All players cooperate (Choose C). This builds trust and sets a foundation for potential mutual cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1):**
   - Each player observes the stock level after growth from the previous round.
     - If the stock is below a predefined threshold T (e.g., half of capacity), the player defects (Choose D) to manage resource depletion.
     - If the stock is above or equal to T, the player continues to cooperate (Choose C).

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - All players defect (Choose D). Since there are no future rounds, maximizing immediate payoff is optimal.

### Explanation:
- **Threshold T:** A crucial parameter set at half of the resource capacity. It acts as a trigger for switching strategies to prevent excessive depletion.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** If the stock falls below T, players temporarily defect to signal the need for conservation, encouraging others to cooperate again once resources recover.
- **Endgame Strategy:** In the final round, with no future consequences, all players defect to maximize their individual payoffs.

### Example Walkthrough:
Assume capacity = 1000 and T = 500.

- **Round 1:** Both players C. Total consumption is moderate, maintaining a healthy stock level.
- **Rounds 2-4:** Players check the stock after each round. If it drops below 500, they defect until recovery.
- **Last Round (e.g., Round 5):** All defect to maximize their final payoff.

This strategy promotes cooperation while allowing strategic defection to manage resources and optimize individual gains in the endgame.

description_COLLECTIVE_244 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to cooperate (take S/(2n)) or defect (take S/n) in each round to maximize total payoff while considering future rounds, we can structure the strategy as follows:

### Strategy:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate. This helps establish a high initial stock level.
2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   - If the current stock level is above half of the capacity (i.e., S > capacity/2), continue to cooperate. This helps sustain the stock for future rounds.
   - If the current stock level is at or below half of the capacity, defect to maximize immediate payoff as the stock isn't regenerating sufficiently.
3. **Last Round (r):** Always defect. Since there are no future rounds to consider, prioritize maximizing your final payoff.

### Explanation:
- **Cooperation in Early Rounds:** By cooperating when the stock is healthy, you ensure that the stock can regenerate and be available for future rounds, maintaining a balance between current and future payoffs.
- **Defection When Necessary:** If the stock drops significantly (below half capacity), defecting ensures you don't miss out on higher immediate gains, which might be crucial if the stock isn't regenerating adequately.
- **Maximizing Final Payoff:** In the last round, since there's no subsequent impact, defecting allows you to take the maximum possible share without concern for future depletion.

This strategy balances sustainability with self-interest, aiming to optimize total payoff across all rounds.

To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose an adaptive approach that balances individual payoffs with long-term sustainability. The strategy leverages perfect information about past actions and the current stock level to guide decision-making.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round Cooperation:**
   - All players begin by Cooperating (C) to establish trust and maintain a high initial stock level, ensuring maximum growth potential for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock is above 75% of capacity.
     - **Cooperation Check:** And if at least half of the players Cooperated in the previous round, continue Cooperating.
   - **Defection Trigger:** If either the stock has dropped below 75% or fewer than half Cooperated last round, switch to Defecting (D) to protect individual payoffs.

3. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - In the final round, assess both the current stock level and historical cooperation.
     - **Cooperate** if the stock is above 50% of capacity and a majority Cooperated in previous rounds.
     - **Defect** otherwise to maximize immediate payoff when future consequences are absent.

### Pseudocode Representation:
```python
def strategy(n, r, t, S, C_prev):
    if t == 1:
        return "C"
    elif t == r:
        if S > 0.5 * capacity and C_prev >= n / 2:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
    else:
        if S > 0.75 * capacity and C_prev >= n / 2:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Builds a foundation of trust, maximizing stock growth.
- **Adaptive Thresholds:** Adjust actions based on stock health and peer behavior to sustain resources while protecting against exploitation.
- **Final Round Prudence:** Balances immediate gains with sustainability, ensuring fair use even in the endgame.

This strategy promotes cooperation when beneficial and defects judiciously, aiming for a balance that maximizes collective payoffs over the game's duration.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_246 = '''
To design an effective collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that encourages cooperation while protecting against exploitation. Here's a structured plan:

### Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Sustainability

1. **First Round Action**:
   - **Cooperate (C)**: Start by cooperating to establish a sustainable stock level from the beginning.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Past Actions**: Track the number of players who defected in recent rounds.
   - **Stock Level Check**: Assess the current stock against a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
     - **If Stock ≥ Threshold and ≤75% Players Cooperated Recently**: Continue cooperating to maintain sustainability.
     - **If Stock < Threshold or >25% Defected Recently**: Switch to defecting to protect your payoff.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - **Defect (D)**: In the final round, maximize immediate gain since there's no future stock to sustain.

4. **Post-Defection Strategy**:
   - After defecting, monitor if stock levels recover and cooperation increases.
   - If conditions improve (e.g., stock above threshold and fewer defections), revert to cooperating.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with C sets a cooperative tone and maintains a healthy stock.
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Using specific thresholds ensures the strategy responds appropriately without being too rigid.
- **Last Round Exploitation**: Defecting in the last round maximizes personal gain without long-term consequences.

This approach balances individual payoff with collective sustainability, adapting based on others' actions and stock health.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_247 = '''
To address the problem of crafting an optimal strategy for each player in a repeated game where they can choose to either Cooperate or Defect, balancing immediate gain with long-term sustainability of the resource (represented by the stock level), we propose the following approach:

### Strategy:
1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate to maximize initial sustainability and maintain the stock at its highest level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock level \( S \) is greater than half of the capacity, continue to Cooperate. This helps in maintaining a sustainable stock level for future rounds.
   - If the stock level \( S \) drops to or below half of the capacity, switch to Defecting to prioritize immediate gains since the stock is already depleted significantly.

### Explanation:
- **Cooperation Threshold**: By setting the threshold at 50% of the capacity, players ensure that they cooperate when the stock is still sufficiently high to support future rounds. This prevents the stock from depleting too quickly.
- **Defection Trigger**: When the stock falls below this threshold, it indicates that sustainability is at risk, and defecting becomes a rational choice to secure immediate benefits rather than risking further depletion with no guarantee of future cooperation from others.

This strategy balances individual self-interest with collective sustainability, providing a clear rule based on observable game state.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_248 = '''
To maintain sustainable resource use, players should cooperate by taking the smaller share unless previous overconsumption occurred, triggering defection. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Assess Previous Consumption:** Each player checks if the total taken in the last round exceeded half the capacity (capacity/2).
   
2. **Determine Action:**
   - If the previous total was within sustainable limits (≤ capacity/2), choose to Cooperate.
   - If it exceeded, Defect this round to enforce sustainability.

3. **Repeat:** Continue applying this rule each round based on the prior round's outcome.

This strategy encourages cooperation while penalizing overuse, aiming for resource conservation.

**Answer:** Each player should Cooperate unless the previous round’s total consumption exceeded half the capacity; if so, they Defect this round to enforce sustainable use.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_249 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with the necessity to defect when exploitation is detected. This strategy aims to sustain the stock for long-term benefits while protecting against being exploited by defectors.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - **First Round:** All players Cooperate (C). This sets a precedent for mutual cooperation and builds trust, maximizing initial payoffs without depleting the stock.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** After the first round, each player evaluates the previous round's total consumption relative to a sustainable threshold.
     - **Sustainable Threshold:** Calculate as `stock/(2n)`. If the average consumption per player in the previous round was below this threshold (indicating sufficient cooperation), continue Cooperating.
     - **Excessive Consumption Detected:** If the average exceeds this threshold, switch strategy to Defect (D) for the next round. This response prevents being exploited by others' defection.

3. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Players continuously monitor the stock level and its trend over previous rounds. A significant decrease in stock indicates potential over-exploitation.
   - If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), players switch to Defecting until the stock shows signs of recovery.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds), players prioritize immediate payoff by defecting more frequently, as future stock sustainability becomes less critical.

### Detailed Decision Rules:

- **First Round:** Cooperate.
- **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
  - Calculate the previous round's average consumption per player.
    - If ≤ `stock_prev/(2n)`, Cooperate.
    - If > `stock_prev/(2n)`, Defect.
- **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of rounds):** Defect to maximize immediate payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(game_state, history):
    current_round = game_state['round']
    stock = game_state['stock']
    n = game_state['n']
    r = game_state['r']

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    prev_stock = history[-1]['stock_after']
    threshold = prev_stock / (2 * n)
    total_consumption_prev = sum(history[-1]['consumptions'])
    avg_consumption_prev = total_consumption_prev / n

    if avg_consumption_prev <= threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

    # For last few rounds, adjust to defect
    if current_round > 0.9 * r:
        return 'D'
```

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages building a healthy stock from the start.
- **Adaptive Response:** Adjusts strategy based on collective behavior, preventing exploitation while maintaining cooperation when beneficial.
- **Endgame Defection:** Maximizes short-term gains when long-term sustainability is less relevant.

This strategy promotes a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability, adapting dynamically to maintain optimal outcomes across all rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_250 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Thresholds**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes collective payoff from the start.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Cooperation Check:** Calculate the cooperation rate in the previous round as `prev_c / n`, where `prev_c` is the number of cooperators.
   - **Stock Threshold:** If both conditions are met—previous cooperation rate exceeds 50% and current stock is above 50% of capacity—continue Cooperating (C).
   - **Defection Trigger:** If either condition isn't met, switch to Defecting (D) to protect your payoff.

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - **Stock Evaluation:** Assess the current stock level.
     - **High Stock (>25% of capacity):** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without future consequences.
     - **Low Stock (≤25% of capacity):** Cooperate (C) to secure a moderate payoff.

This strategy balances cooperation and defection, adapting based on past behavior and stock levels to ensure robust performance against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_251 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed an approach that balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability through adaptive decision-making based on observable stock levels.

**Strategy: Adaptive Stock Threshold Cooperation (ASTC)**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate.
   - All players start by cooperating to establish a baseline of resource conservation and maximize collective sustainability from the beginning.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Assessment**: After each round, evaluate the stock level after regrowth.
   - **Threshold Check**: If the stock after regrowth falls below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), all players cooperate in the next round to help replenish the stock.
   - **Defection Threshold Met**: If the stock remains above or meets the threshold, players are free to defect to maximize their immediate payoffs while ensuring the resource isn't overexploited.

**Rationale**:
- **Sustainability Focus**: By cooperating when the stock is depleted below a certain level, players ensure the resource doesn't collapse, maintaining its availability for future rounds.
- **Adaptability**: The strategy adjusts based on the current state of the stock, allowing players to take advantage of a healthy stock while conserving when necessary.
- **Robustness**: This approach doesn't rely on others' cooperation and uses simple, observable metrics, making it resilient against various player behaviors.

**Implementation Summary**:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Start with cooperation to set a conservation precedent.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Use post-regrowth stock levels to decide future actions, promoting sustainability when needed and allowing for strategic defection otherwise.

This strategy effectively balances individual gains with collective resource management, ensuring long-term benefits through adaptive and informed decision-making.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_252 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can structure our approach around adaptive thresholds and reciprocity mechanisms. Here's a strategic plan:

### 1. Initial Cooperation
- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a cooperative tone and encourage others to follow suit.

### 2. Stock Level Monitoring
- **Thresholds:**
  - **Lower Threshold (50% of Capacity):** If the stock falls below this, switch to cooperation to rebuild the resource.
  - **Upper Threshold (80% of Capacity):** When the stock is above this level, defect strategically to maximize personal gain without risking future sustainability.

### 3. Reciprocity Mechanism
- **Assess Previous Actions:** Track the number of defections in past rounds. If a significant majority cooperated last round, continue cooperating.
- **Punishment for Defection:** If many players defected previously, switch to defection as retaliation but avoid mutual destruction by being forgiving if others revert to cooperation.

### 4. Endgame Strategy
- **Last Round (r):** If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), cooperate to maintain sustainability. Below this threshold, defect to maximize immediate gain, acknowledging the game's conclusion.

### 5. Forgiveness and Adaptation
- After punishing defectors by defecting, monitor if they return to cooperation. If so, revert to cooperation to avoid perpetual mutual defection.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective resource preservation, adapting based on stock levels and opponents' past actions, ensuring robustness across various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_253 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a series of rounds while maintaining the stock level, we can employ an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with necessary defections. This approach ensures that the stock doesn't deplete too rapidly, allowing for sustainable use over all rounds while maximizing payoffs towards the end.

### Strategy:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each subsequent round, monitor whether the stock level has decreased compared to the previous round.
3. **Switch to Defection**: If the stock decreases for two consecutive rounds, switch to defecting to prevent further rapid depletion.
4. **Revert to Cooperation**: Once in defect mode, continuously check if the stock starts increasing for two consecutive rounds. If it does, revert to cooperation to allow the stock to recover.
5. **Endgame Defection**: In the final round, regardless of previous actions, defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future stock to preserve.

### Solution Code:
```python
class AdaptiveStrategy:
    def __init__(self, total_rounds):
        self.total_rounds = total_rounds
        self.current_action = 'C'
        self.depletion_counter = 0
        self_recovery_counter = 0
        self.previous_stock = None

    def decide(self, current_stock):
        if self.previous_stock is not None:
            # Check if stock decreased compared to previous round's after growth
            if current_stock < self.previous_stock:
                self.depletion_counter += 1
                if self.depletion_counter >= 2 and self.current_action == 'C':
                    # Switch to D if depletion for two consecutive rounds
                    self.current_action = 'D'
            else:
                self.depletion_counter = 0
                # If in D mode, check if stock is recovering
                if self.current_action == 'D':
                    self_recovery_counter += 1
                    if self_recovery_counter >= 2:
                        self.current_action = 'C'
                        self_recovery_counter = 0
                else:
                    pass

        # Check for endgame condition
        if self.total_rounds - self.round_number <= 1:
            return 'D'

        self.previous_stock = current_stock
        return self.current_action

    def update_round(self, round_number):
        self.round_number = round_number
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to set a positive tone and maintain the stock.
- **Stock Monitoring**: After each round, it checks if the stock has decreased. Two consecutive decreases trigger a switch to defection to slow down depletion.
- **Defection and Recovery**: While defecting, it waits for two consecutive increases in stock levels before reverting to cooperation, ensuring recovery is sustained.
- **Endgame Defection**: In the last round, it defects to secure maximum personal gain since future rounds are no longer a concern.

This adaptive approach ensures that while the strategy aims to maintain cooperation and stock health, it doesn't hesitate to defect when necessary to protect against rapid depletion or maximize endgame payoffs.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Reciprocity with Stock Sustainability (ARSS)

**Objective:** Balance individual payoffs with collective sustainability through adaptive reciprocity, ensuring robustness against diverse opponent behaviors.

---

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to initiate trust and observe others' actions.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - **Cooperate (C)** if the stock is above a target threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) and at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round.
  - **Defect (D)** if the stock drops below the target or fewer than half cooperated last round, or if your payoff was significantly lower than expected, indicating others defected.

#### 2. Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Start with Cooperate to promote initial trust.
- **Last Round:** Optimize for immediate gain; defect if beneficial, considering no future repercussions.
- **Low Stock:** If stock is critically low (e.g., below 20% of capacity), defect to maximize short-term payoff.

#### 3. Collective Alignment:
- **Monitor and Respond:** Adjust strategy based on collective past actions and stock levels, promoting sustainability while protecting individual interests.
- **Reciprocity:** Cooperate when others do, defect when they don't, maintaining fairness without being exploited.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def ARSS_strategy(parameters, state, history):
    n = parameters['n']
    capacity = parameters['capacity']
    stock = state['stock']
    round_num = state['round']
    prev_actions = history['prev_actions'] if 'prev_actions' in history else []
    
    if round_num == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    target_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    coop_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'C')
    coop_prop = coop_count / n
    
    if stock > target_threshold and coop_prop >= 0.5:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage
parameters = {'n':4, 'capacity':100}
state = {'stock':75, 'round':2}
history = {'prev_actions':['C','C','D','D']}
print(ARSS_strategy(parameters, state, history))  # Output: 'D'
```

---

### Summary:
The ARSS strategy begins with cooperation to foster trust and adapts based on stock levels and collective behavior. It switches to defecting when necessary to prevent resource depletion or exploitation, ensuring both individual and collective sustainability over the game's duration.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_255 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual gains with collective sustainability in a repeated game scenario, we can employ a strategy that adapts based on observable outcomes. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and observe the initial outcome.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Observation:** After each round, observe the stock level after growth (S_after_growth).
   - **Threshold Check:** Determine if S_after_growth is above or below a predefined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
     - **If Above Threshold:** Cooperate in the next round. This encourages continued cooperation when the stock is healthy.
     - **If Below Threshold:** Defect in the next round as a form of punishment to deter excessive depletion.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate if the stock level after growth in the previous round was above the threshold; otherwise, defect.
   - **Rationale:** In the final round, prioritize maximizing the current payoff based on the stock's health without future consequences.

### Explanation

- **Cooperation Threshold:** The strategy uses a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) to decide between cooperation and defection. This threshold ensures that players only switch strategies when there is significant depletion.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** By defecting when the stock falls below the threshold, players signal the need for others to cooperate, aiming to restore a healthy stock level.
- **Sustainability Focus:** The approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by maintaining cooperation when the stock is strong and only punishing when necessary.

### Conclusion

This strategy fosters cooperation while allowing for responsive punishment against excessive depletion. It leverages observable outcomes to guide decisions, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_256 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for cooperation versus defection in repeated interactions, we can propose a balanced and adaptive approach that considers both the current state (stock level) and recent behavior of other players. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate.
   - Begin by cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and resource conservation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Check Current Stock Level:** If the stock is above 50% of its maximum capacity, proceed to check cooperation history; otherwise, defect.
   - **Evaluate Recent Cooperation:** Count the number of players who cooperated in the previous round. If at least half (i.e., n/2 for even n or ceiling(n/2) for odd n) cooperated, continue cooperating. Otherwise, defect.

3. **Endgame Rounds (Last Two Rounds):** Always defect.
   - In the final two rounds, prioritize maximizing individual payoff by defecting, as there are limited future interactions to preserve resources.

This strategy balances cooperation when it is mutually beneficial and resource levels are sustainable with defection when necessary to protect individual interests or in the endgame. It adapts based on both environmental cues (stock level) and social cues (others' actions), fostering a cooperative environment while safeguarding against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_257 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining the common resource while maximizing individual payoffs, we can design a strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment

1. **First Round:** Cooperate unconditionally to establish a cooperative baseline and avoid immediate depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the stock level after the previous round is below 50% of capacity, defect in the current round as a punitive measure.
   - **Majority Defection Check:** If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to avoid being exploited by consistent defectors.
   - **Continue Cooperation:** If neither condition is met, continue cooperating to sustain the resource and maximize long-term payoffs.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Conditional Cooperation:** If the stock level is above 75% of capacity, cooperate to ensure a high final payoff without depleting the resource excessively.
   - **Defection if Necessary:** If the stock is below or equal to 75% capacity, defect to maximize your immediate gain since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation encourages others to reciprocate and builds a foundation for sustainability.
- **Punitive Defection:** Defecting when the stock is low or many have defected previously deters exploitation and encourages others to return to cooperation.
- **Final Round Strategy:** Cooperating if the stock is high ensures a mutually beneficial outcome, while defecting when it's low prevents missing out on potential gains.

This strategy combines responsiveness to environmental cues (stock levels) with social dynamics (others' behavior), aiming to maintain resource health while protecting individual interests.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_258 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Thresholds (ACST)**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of trust and maintain the stock.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players from the previous round.
  - If the stock level is above 70% of capacity, cooperate if at least half of the other players cooperated previously. Otherwise, defect.
  - If the stock level is below 70%, defect regardless of others' past actions to protect your payoff.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Always cooperate to encourage initial sustainability.
- **Last Round (r):** Defect if the majority defected in the previous round; otherwise, cooperate to end on a positive note.
- **Low Stock Levels (<30% of capacity):** Cooperate to allow stock replenishment for future rounds.

**3. Collective Mindset:**
- Prioritize maintaining a sustainable stock level to ensure long-term payoffs for all players.
- Balance individual gain with collective well-being by cooperating when beneficial and defecting only when necessary.

**4. Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def ACST_strategy(game_state, history):
    if game_state.round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        stock = game_state.stock
        capacity = game_state.capacity
        threshold = 0.7 * capacity
        prev_actions = history[-1]
        
        # Calculate number of cooperators excluding self
        coop_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'C' and action != own_action)
        
        if stock > threshold:
            if coop_count >= (game_state.n - 1) / 2:
                return "C"
            else:
                return "D"
        else:
            return "D"

# Note: This pseudocode is a simplified version for illustration.
```

**5. Strategy Explanation:**
- **Adaptive Cooperation:** The strategy starts cooperatively and adjusts based on stock levels and others' behavior, promoting sustainability.
- **Stock Thresholds:** Using 70% as a threshold helps maintain a healthy resource level, ensuring future rounds remain viable.
- **Forgiveness and Adaptation:** By cooperating when possible and defecting strategically, the strategy avoids exploitation while encouraging collective welfare.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to the game's state and others' actions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_259 = '''
The collective strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game is called "Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACT)". It balances cooperation and defection to maintain stock levels while maximizing individual payoffs. Here's how it works:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACT)

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - Each player cooperates if the current stock is above a dynamic threshold based on remaining rounds.
   - The threshold starts at 80% of capacity in the first round and decreases by 8% each subsequent round, ensuring higher conservation early on.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: All players cooperate to preserve the stock.
   - **Last Round (r)**: All players defect to maximize immediate payoffs since there's no future stock to protect.

3. **Collective Mindset**:
   - The strategy is designed for all players to follow, ensuring a unified approach towards stock management without communication.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def ACT_strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, current_round):
    # Calculate the threshold for the current round
    if current_round == 1:
        threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    else:
        # Decrease threshold by 8% each round starting from 80% in round 1
        threshold = max(0.2 * (r - current_round + 1) * capacity, 0)
    
    if current_stock >= threshold and current_round < r:
        return "C"
    else:
        # Defect if stock is below threshold or it's the last round
        return "D"

# Example usage:
n = 4
r = 10
capacity = 100
current_stock = 75
current_round = 3

action = ACT_strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, current_round)
print(action)  # Output: "C" or "D" based on threshold calculation
```

### Explanation

- **Dynamic Threshold**: The strategy uses a decreasing threshold to determine when to switch from cooperation to defection. This ensures that early rounds prioritize stock preservation.
- **Adaptation**: Players adapt their actions based on the current stock and round number, making the strategy responsive to changing conditions.
- **Robustness**: By collectively following this rule, players balance individual payoffs with long-term sustainability, reducing the risk of rapid stock depletion.

This approach ensures that players work together implicitly to maintain a healthy stock level while allowing for strategic defection when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_260 = '''
To design an effective collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the common resource. The strategy should adapt based on the game's state and history while handling edge cases such as the first and last rounds.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Based Triggers (ACS)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - **Stock Level Check**: If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, Cooperate if the majority (more than 50%) of players Cooperated in the previous round.
  - **Defection Trigger**: If more than 30% of players Defected last round or the stock has dropped below 50%, switch to Defecting to protect against overexploitation.
- **Endgame Handling**: In the last two rounds, always Defect since there's no future stock to preserve.

#### 2. Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Cooperate to maximize initial stock growth.
- **Last Two Rounds**: Defect to secure maximum payoffs without concern for future depletion.

#### 3. Adaptive Mechanism:
- Continuously monitor the number of Defectors and stock levels after each round.
- Adjust actions based on these observations, promoting cooperation when sustainable but defending against exploitation when necessary.

### Summary
This strategy promotes initial cooperation to build trust and sustain resources. It adapts by observing others' actions and the resource's health, switching to defection when overexploitation is detected or in endgame scenarios. This balanced approach supports collective well-being while protecting individual payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_261 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can adopt an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maintain resource sustainability while discouraging exploitation. Here's a structured plan:

### Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACWP)

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C). This initializes trust and maximizes stock growth for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Previous Round**: Calculate the total consumption from the last round.
     - Compute the expected total consumption if all had cooperated: `expected_C = previous_stock / 2`.
     - Compare actual total consumption with `expected_C`.

   - **Punishment Mechanism**:
     - If actual consumption exceeds `expected_C`, indicating defections, defect (D) in the current round to punish.
     - If actual consumption is within the expected range, continue cooperating.

3. **Stock Level Consideration**:
   - Continuously monitor the current stock level after each round's growth phase.
   - If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., half of capacity), switch to cooperation for the next few rounds to allow recovery, regardless of recent actions by others.

4. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - As the game progresses towards the final rounds, prioritize cooperation if the stock is stable to prevent unnecessary depletion.
   - In the last few rounds, consider defecting if necessary to maximize individual gain without jeopardizing the resource's sustainability.

### Implementation Logic

```python
def determine_action(current_stock, previous_stock, history):
    # Constants
    CRITICAL_STOCK_THRESHOLD = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'  # First round: Cooperate
    
    expected_C_consumption = previous_stock / 2
    actual_consumption = sum([action.consumption for action in history[-1]])
    
    if current_stock < CRITICAL_STOCK_THRESHOLD:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if actual_consumption > expected_C_consumption:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **First Round Cooperation**: Establishes a foundation of trust, encouraging initial resource growth.
- **Punishment for Recent Defections**: Deters players from exploiting the resource by defecting, maintaining fairness.
- **Stock Recovery Priority**: Ensures the resource isn't depleted beyond recovery thresholds, sustaining it for future rounds.
- **Endgame Balance**: Adjusts strategy to optimize gains while preserving resource stability towards the game's conclusion.

This strategy dynamically adjusts based on both historical actions and current resource health, promoting a balance between cooperation and necessary punishment to maintain equilibrium.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_262 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocal Conservation (ARC)**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**  
   - In the first round, all players cooperate by choosing action C. This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes initial stock sustainability.

2. **Stock Monitoring and Thresholds:**  
   - After each round, calculate the current stock level, S_t.
   - Define a threshold at 50% of the game's capacity (Threshold = capacity / 2).

3. **Cooperation Zone:**  
   - If S_t > Threshold: Continue cooperating by choosing C. This sustains the stock and maintains high payoffs.

4. **Defection Trigger:**  
   - If S_t ≤ Threshold or if there is a noticeable downward trend in stock levels over previous rounds, switch to defecting (D) for one round. This allows the stock to recover without immediate over-exploitation.

5. **Recovery and Forgiveness:**  
   - After defecting, monitor the next round's stock level.
   - If S_{t+1} > Threshold, return to cooperation in subsequent rounds. This incentivizes others to resume cooperation by rewarding stock recovery.

6. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**  
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., final 2-3 rounds), if S_t is above Threshold, continue cooperating to maintain a healthy stock for maximum payoffs.
   - If S_t is below Threshold in the final round, defect to maximize immediate gain since future consequences are limited.

7. **Robustness and Adaptability:**  
   - The strategy adapts based on stock dynamics rather than assuming others' behaviors, ensuring robustness against various opponent actions.
   - It balances individual gains with collective sustainability by reciprocating cooperation when conditions improve.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
def ARC_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, total_rounds):
    threshold = capacity / 2
    if round_num == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock > threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Check trend or simply defect once if below threshold
        return 'D'

# Example with trend checking (simplified)
def ARC_strategy_trend(n, capacity, stock_history, round_num, total_rounds):
    threshold = capacity / 2
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    if round_num == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock > threshold and is_increasing(stock_history):
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Defect if trend is downward or below threshold
        return 'D'

def is_increasing(stock_history):
    # Simple check: last three stocks are increasing
    if len(stock_history) < 3:
        return True
    return stock_history[-1] > stock_history[-2] and stock_history[-2] > stock_history[-3]
```

**Rationale:**  
- **Initial Cooperation** fosters trust and maintains a high initial stock level.
- **Threshold-Based Decision Making** ensures that players act to conserve the resource when it's most needed, preventing over-depletion.
- **Temporary Defection** allows the stock to recover without punishing others excessively, promoting a balance between individual and collective gains.
- **Adaptability** through monitoring stock trends makes the strategy responsive to changing conditions, enhancing its robustness in various scenarios.

This strategy encourages cooperation while being resilient against exploitation, aiming for sustained payoffs over all rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_263 = '''
**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy combines reciprocity with stock level monitoring, balancing cooperation for sustainability and self-interest when others defect excessively. Here's how it works:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and maximize collective payoff.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Track the number of defectors in previous rounds.
     - If more than 30% have defected, switch to Defect (D).
   - Monitor stock levels after growth each round.
     - If stock drops below 50% of capacity, switch to D to secure higher payoffs.

3. **Last Round**: Cooperate if overall cooperation was high; otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

This strategy adapts based on others' behavior and stock health, aiming to sustainably maximize total payoffs while protecting against overexploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_264 = '''
To balance immediate gains with future sustainability in the game, we propose a threshold-based strategy where players decide to Cooperate or Defect based on the current stock level relative to half of the total capacity. This approach ensures that while the stock is abundant, players can take more, but when it's low, they conserve for future rounds.

**Strategy:**

1. **Threshold Calculation:** Set a threshold \( T \) at half of the total capacity (\( T = 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \)).

2. **Decision Making in Each Round:**
   - If the current stock \( S_t \) is below or equal to \( T \), choose to **Cooperate**.
   - If \( S_t \) is above \( T \), choose to **Defect**.

This strategy guides players to conserve when the stock is low and utilize it more when it's plentiful, aiming for a sustainable balance over the game's duration.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_265 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment**

1. **Initial Action**: Cooperate in the first round to maximize collective benefit and set a cooperative tone.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each round, evaluate the current stock relative to capacity.

3. **Cooperation Threshold**: If the stock is above 90% of capacity, continue cooperating to maintain sustainability.

4. **Punishment Mechanism**: 
   - If the stock drops below 90%, defect in the next round to punish defectors.
   - After punishing, revert to cooperation unless the stock continues to decline, indicating persistent defection.

5. **Final Round Consideration**: Cooperate in the last round if the stock is stable; otherwise, consider defecting if previous rounds indicated others defected.

This strategy balances individual and collective interests by maintaining cooperation while addressing potential exploitation through targeted punishment.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_266 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we can employ an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observed outcomes. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Based Thresholds (ACST)

#### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Always cooperate in the first round to establish a high stock level and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Stock Trend Monitoring**: After each round, assess whether the stock has decreased significantly from its previous level. A significant decrease is defined as when the stock falls below 75% of capacity or shows a downward trend over two consecutive rounds.
3. **Adaptive Defection**: If the stock has decreased significantly, switch to defecting in the next round to maximize immediate payoffs before the stock depletes further.
4. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After defecting, monitor if the stock begins to recover (i.e., increases or stabilizes). If recovery is observed, revert to cooperation to sustain the resource for future rounds.
5. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last round, always defect to maximize immediate payoffs since there are no subsequent rounds to preserve the stock.

#### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round**: Cooperate unconditionally to start with a full stock and promote initial cooperation among players.
- **Last Round**: Defect to secure the highest possible payoff without concern for future depletion.
- **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock drops below 50% of capacity, defect until it recovers above this threshold or until the last round.

#### Rationale:
This strategy encourages initial cooperation to maintain a sustainable resource but adapts by punishing defectors through defection when the stock is over-exploited. It balances individual gain with collective sustainability, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors without relying on coordination.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def ACST_strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return 'C'
    elif len(history) == r:  # Last round
        return 'D'
    
    previous_stock = history[-2]['stock']
    stock_change = current_stock - previous_stock
    
    if stock_change < -threshold:  # Stock is decreasing significantly
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

# Parameters:
- threshold: A predefined value (e.g., 10) to determine significant stock decrease.
```

This strategy is designed to be both cooperative and resilient, ensuring players act in their best interest while contributing to the sustainability of the common resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_267 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can outline an approach that balances cooperation with self-interest, ensuring sustainability while adapting to the game's state. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a high initial stock level.
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds don't exist.
   - **Intermediate Rounds:**
     - Let \( S_{\text{prev}} \) be the stock at the end of the previous round.
     - If \( S_{\text{prev}} > 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \), Cooperate (C).
     - Otherwise, Defect (D).

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If the stock ever reaches zero in any round before the last, defect in all subsequent rounds as cooperation yields no benefit.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   This strategy promotes maintaining a healthy stock level through cooperation when it's sustainable and switches to self-interest when the stock is depleted beyond a threshold, ensuring players adapt collectively without reliance on communication.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_cooperation(n, capacity, current_stock, round, total_rounds):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        previous_stock = current_stock  # Assuming current_stock is updated after each round
        if previous_stock > 0.5 * capacity:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

### Explanation

- **First Round Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to maintain a high stock level, encouraging sustainable use from the beginning.
- **Stock Threshold for Cooperation:** Uses a threshold of half the capacity; if the previous round's stock is above this, continue cooperating. This balances immediate gains with future sustainability.
- **Last Round Defection:** Maximizes payoff in the final round as there are no subsequent rounds to preserve the stock for.
- **Edge Case Handling:** If the stock depletes to zero, defecting becomes the optimal choice since cooperation provides no benefit.

This strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors and adapts dynamically based on observed stock levels, aligning individual actions with collective sustainability goals.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_268 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with the need to maintain a sustainable stock level. The strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors while ensuring long-term payoffs.

### Strategy Overview: "Adaptive Reciprocity with Stock Conservation"

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players Cooperate (C) to establish trust and maximize initial stock sustainability.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - For subsequent rounds, each player calculates the average cooperation rate of all other players from previous rounds.
   - If this average exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 70%), the player chooses to Cooperate.
   - If the average is below the threshold or the current stock level is critically low, the player defects to protect their immediate payoff.

3. **Stock Conservation Mechanism:**
   - Monitor the current stock level after each round.
   - If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), players enter Conservation mode, prioritizing Cooperation to allow stock replenishment.

4. **Forgiveness and Adaptation:**
   - Implement a forgiveness mechanism where if other players resume cooperation for a set number of rounds, the strategy reverts to cooperating, encouraging mutual beneficial behavior.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - In the final round, players may choose to Defect if the stock is sufficiently high to avoid depletion, balancing immediate gain with sustainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_reciprocity(n, r, capacity):
    history = []  # Tracks others' past actions
    current_stock = capacity

    for round in range(1, r + 1):
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            avg_coop = average_cooperation(history)
            stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity

            if avg_coop > 0.7 and current_stock > stock_threshold:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'

        # Update history with others' actions
        history.append(others_actions)

    return total_payoff

def average_cooperation(history):
    cooperate_count = sum(1 for action in history if action == 'C')
    return cooperate_count / len(history)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Establishes a foundation of trust and maintains the stock at a healthy level.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Encourages cooperation when others are likely to reciprocate, while defecting when necessary to protect self-interest.
- **Stock Conservation:** Ensures that the common pool remains viable for future rounds by prioritizing sustainability when the stock is low.
- **Forgiveness Mechanism:** Allows for recovery of cooperative behavior after periods of defection, fostering long-term mutual benefit.

This strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on both group behavior and environmental (stock) conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_269 = '''
### Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Rounds:** Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial stock growth.
- **Stock Monitoring:** After each round, calculate the current stock level as a proportion of the capacity. If the stock is above 50% of the capacity, continue cooperating (C). If it drops below 50%, switch to defecting (D) for the next two rounds to conserve resources and allow regrowth.
- **Punishment Phase:** If the stock falls below the threshold, defect for a set number of rounds (e.g., 2 rounds) to signal displeasure and reduce overexploitation. After this period, reassess the stock level.
- **Forgiveness:** Once the stock recovers above the threshold, revert to cooperating (C).
- **Final Round:** In the last round of the game, always choose D to maximize immediate payoff since future sustainability is no longer a concern.

**2. Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Always cooperate (C) to initiate cooperation and build trust.
- **Last Round:** Always defect (D) to maximize individual payoff without considering future consequences.
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock reaches zero, continue defecting (D), as there is no benefit in cooperating with an exhausted resource.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
This strategy promotes a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability by encouraging cooperation when the resource is plentiful and switching to defection only when necessary to prevent overexploitation. It aligns with a collective mindset by prioritizing long-term resource availability while adapting to others' actions.

    # Check if stock is above or below threshold
    if stock >= threshold:
        # Cooperate if stock is sufficient
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Defect for a set number of rounds to punish defectors and conserve stock
        punishment_rounds_remaining = history.get('punishment_rounds', 0)
        
        if punishment_rounds_remaining > 0:
            # Continue defecting if still in punishment phase
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Start punishing for the next few rounds
            history['punishment_rounds'] = punishment_rounds
            return 'D'
    
    # Forgive and revert to cooperation after punishment or stock recovery
    if current_round > 1 and stock >= threshold:
        history['punishment_rounds'] = 0
        return 'C'
    
    return 'D'

# Example usage in a round:
action = adaptive_threshold_cooperation(game_parameters, game_state, history)

This strategy aims to balance individual and collective interests by adaptively switching between cooperation and defection based on the stock level. It is robust against various opponent behaviors while promoting resource sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_270 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize individual and collective payoffs by balancing immediate gains with sustainable resource use through adaptive cooperation and defection.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**

- **Initial Round (Round 1):** 
  - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - **Rationale:** Establish trust and observe others' behavior without initial depletion.

- **Subsequent Rounds (Round t > 1):**
  - **Monitor Previous Actions:** Track how many players defected in the previous round.
  - **Tit-for-Tat Response:** If more than 25% of players defected in the last round, defect in the current round. Otherwise, cooperate.

- **Stock Conservation Threshold:**
  - **Threshold:** Current stock < capacity / 2
  - **Action:** Cooperate to allow stock recovery, regardless of others' past actions.

- **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
  - After several consecutive rounds (e.g., 3) where fewer than 25% defected and stock has recovered above the threshold, revert to cooperation.

---

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
- **Last Round:** Cooperate if the stock is above the threshold; otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize cooperation when stock is below the threshold to ensure resource sustainability.

---

### **3. Collective Alignment**

This strategy encourages mutual cooperation while allowing flexibility to adapt based on both social dynamics and environmental conditions. By punishing recent defections and conserving resources when necessary, it fosters a balance between individual gain and collective welfare.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, history, current_stock):
    if len(history) == 0:
        return "C"  # First round
    
    previous_actions = history[-1]
    defections = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
    
    if current_stock < (capacity / 2):
        return "C"
    else:
        if (defections / n) > 0.25:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

    # After several rounds of low defections, consider forgiving
    recent_history = history[-3:]
    recent_defections = sum(a == 'D' for actions in recent_history for a in actions)
    if (recent_defections / (3 * n)) < 0.25 and current_stock > (capacity / 2):
        return "C"
```

---

**Summary:** This strategy starts with cooperation, retaliates against significant defection, prioritizes stock conservation when necessary, and forgives to reset cooperation, ensuring a robust approach to the game's challenges.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_271 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Based Triggers**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a high stock level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - After each round, monitor the stock level.
   - If the stock is increasing or stable, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock shows a consistent decrease over two consecutive rounds, switch to defecting (D).

3. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - Always Defect in the last round since there's no future benefit from cooperation.

**Rationale:**

- The strategy starts with cooperation to build a sustainable resource base.
- It adapts by monitoring the stock's health, switching to defection if the resource is being depleted unsustainably.
- The last-round defection maximizes personal gain without compromising future rounds since they no longer exist.

This approach balances collective welfare with individual self-interest, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_272 = '''
To address the challenge of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round based on the previous stock level, we propose a simple yet effective strategy. This approach aims to balance resource utilization with conservation by responding to the stock's state.

### Strategy:

1. **Threshold Rule**:
   - In each round \( t \), observe the stock level from the previous round (\( S_{t-1} \)).
   - If \( S_{t-1} \) is greater than 50% of the capacity, choose to **Cooperate**.
   - If \( S_{t-1} \) is 50% or less of the capacity, choose to **Defect**.

2. **Rationale**:
   - **Cooperating when the stock is above 50%**: This helps maintain a high stock level by limiting consumption, allowing for sustainable use and preventing rapid depletion.
   - **Defecting when the stock is below or equal to 50%**: This allows players to consume more when the stock is lower, balancing utilization with conservation.

This strategy encourages cooperation during times of abundance while allowing for resource utilization during scarcity. It provides a straightforward rule that responds dynamically to the stock's state without requiring complex coordination or communication among players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_273 = '''
To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we need to balance cooperation and self-interest while ensuring the sustainability of the resource. The proposed strategy incorporates elements of reciprocity and adaptiveness based on observed behavior and current state.

### Strategy: Cooperative Punishment with Stock Threshold (CPS)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** All players cooperate. This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes initial stock sustainability.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
  - Calculate the expected total consumption if all had cooperated in the previous round, \( E = \frac{S_{\text{prev}}}{2} \).
  - Compare this with the actual total consumption from the previous round:
    - If actual consumption exceeds \( E \), defect in the current round as a form of punishment.
    - If not, check the current stock level \( S_t \):
      - Cooperate if \( S_t \geq 2n \).
      - Defect if \( S_t < 2n \) to protect self-interest when the stock is low.

- **Last Two Rounds (t ≥ r-1):**
  - If \( S_t < 2n \), defect to maximize immediate payoff.
  - Otherwise, cooperate to maintain stock health.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **Low Stock Levels:** Defect if the stock drops below a sustainable threshold (\( 2n \)), ensuring players don't overexploit the resource.
  
- **Final Rounds:** In the last two rounds, defect if the stock is low to secure individual payoffs, balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

#### 3. Collective Alignment:
The strategy encourages cooperation when mutually beneficial and sustainable, while incorporating punishment mechanisms to deter defection. It adapts based on observed behavior and current stock levels, promoting a balance between collective welfare and self-interest.

### Summary:

- **Cooperate** in the first round and whenever others cooperate and the stock is sustainable.
- **Defect** if others have defected previously or when the stock is low, ensuring resource sustainability and individual payoff protection.

This strategy aims to maintain cooperation while being robust against various opponent behaviors, ensuring long-term benefits for all players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_274 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that encourages cooperation while adapting to the game's state and opponents' actions. The strategy should be adaptive, ensuring sustainable resource use without requiring direct communication among players.

### Strategy Overview:
The proposed strategy is based on tracking past behavior and current stock levels to decide whether to cooperate or defect in each round. It uses a threshold system to determine when cooperation is beneficial and when defection is necessary as a response to others' actions.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe the initial behavior of other players.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - For each round after the first, evaluate two key factors:
     a. **Number of Cooperators in the Last Round:** Count how many players chose C in the previous round.
     b. **Current Stock Level:** Check if the stock after the last round is above a defined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - If more than half of the players cooperated in the last round and the current stock level is above the threshold, continue to Cooperate.
   - If fewer than expected players cooperated or the stock level is below the threshold, Defect for this round as a response.

4. **Stock Threshold Adjustment:**
   - The stock threshold can be set dynamically based on the game's capacity and number of players. For example, in a 4-player game with a capacity of 100, set the threshold at 50 units.

5. **Final Rounds:**
   - Maintain consistency by applying the same decision rules even in the final rounds to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize cooperation.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, previous_actions, stock_history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate number of cooperators in the last round
    num_cooperators = sum(1 for action in previous_actions[-1] if action == 'C')
    
    # Determine if cooperation threshold is met (e.g., more than half)
    cooperation_threshold = len(previous_actions[-1]) / 2
    enough_cooperators = num_cooperators >= cooperation_threshold
    
    # Get the stock level after the last round
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    stock_threshold = 0.5 * stock_history[0]  # Adjust based on initial capacity
    
    if enough_cooperators and current_stock >= stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage in a game loop:
actions = []
stock_levels = [initial_capacity]
for round in range(total_rounds):
    action = decide_action(round + 1, actions, stock_levels)
    actions.append([action for _ in players])
    # Simulate the round to get new stock level
    total_consumption = calculate_total_consumption(actions[-1], stock_levels[-1])
    stock_after = stock_levels[-1] - total_consumption
    growth = 2 * stock_after * (1 - stock_after / initial_capacity)
    new_stock = min(stock_after + growth, initial_capacity)
    stock_levels.append(new_stock)
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and allows players to gauge others' willingness to collaborate.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** By evaluating past actions and current stock levels, the strategy dynamically adjusts behavior, promoting sustainability and discouraging excessive defection.
- **Stock Threshold:** Ensures that cooperation continues only when resource regeneration can sustain future rounds, preventing depletion.

This approach balances individual and collective interests, fostering a stable and productive game environment.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Based Thresholds (ACS)

**Objective:**  
Maintain a sustainable common pool resource by balancing individual payoffs with collective resource preservation through adaptive cooperation based on observed stock trends and dynamic thresholds.

---

### 1. Decision Rules:

#### **a. Initial Rounds (First Round):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to maximize initial collective payoff and establish a pattern of cooperation, encouraging others to do the same.

#### **b. Subsequent Rounds:**
- **Monitor Stock Trend:** Calculate the stock level at the end of each round.
- **Determine Cooperation Threshold:** Set a dynamic threshold for cooperation based on the stock's current level relative to capacity. The threshold decreases as rounds progress:
  - **Early Rounds:** Higher threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
  - **Later Rounds:** Lower threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
- **Defect if Threshold Breached:** If the stock falls below the threshold, switch to Defection (D) for that round. Otherwise, continue Cooperating.
- **Adjust Based on Recent History:** If in the last few rounds, the stock has been declining despite cooperation, consider defecting sooner to prevent depletion.

#### **c. Last Round:**
- **Action:** Defect (D)
- **Rationale:** In the final round, there’s no future resource to preserve, so maximize immediate payoff by defecting.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

#### **a. First Round:**
- Cooperate unconditionally to set a cooperative precedent and maximize initial collective payoff.

#### **b. Last Round (Round r):**
- Defect to secure maximum personal gain since future sustainability is no longer a concern.

#### **c. Stock Depletion:**
- If the stock drops to zero in any round, defect in all subsequent rounds as cooperation yields no benefit when the resource is depleted.

---

### 3. Collective Alignment:

- **Monitor and Respond to Stock Trends:** Cooperate when the stock is above the threshold; defect when it's below.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Lower the cooperation threshold progressively as the game advances, reflecting the diminishing resource and encouraging earlier defection if sustainability is at risk.

---

### Pseudocode:

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_strategy(game_params, current_state, history):
    n = game_params['n']
    r = game_params['r']
    capacity = game_params['capacity']
    current_round = current_state['round']
    stock = current_state['stock']

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Determine cooperation threshold based on round progress
    progress_ratio = current_round / (r + 1)
    cooperation_threshold = capacity * (1 - progress_ratio)

    if stock > cooperation_threshold and not is_stock_depleting(history):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

def is_stock_depleting(history):
    # Check if stock has been decreasing in recent rounds
    recent_stocks = [h['stock'] for h in history[-3:]]  # Last 3 rounds
    return all(recent_stocks[i] < recent_stocks[i-1] for i in range(1, len(recent_stocks)))

# In last round, always defect
if current_round == r:
    action = 'D'
else:
    action = adaptive_cooperation_strategy(game_params, current_state, history)
```

---

### Strategy Explanation:

This strategy begins with cooperation to foster a cooperative environment and maximize initial payoffs. It adaptively switches to defection based on the stock level relative to a decreasing threshold, ensuring resource sustainability while protecting individual interests when necessary. By monitoring stock trends and adjusting behavior dynamically, it balances collective good with self-interest effectively throughout the game's progression.

description_COLLECTIVE_276 = '''
**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment and Endgame Optimization**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Cooperation:** Cooperate (C) for the first 10% of rounds or a maximum of 5 rounds, whichever is shorter.
   - **Stock-Based Cooperation:** If the stock drops below 50% of capacity, switch to cooperating until it recovers above this threshold.
   - **Tit-for-Tat Mechanism:** After initial cooperation, if more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect (D) for up to 3 subsequent rounds as punishment.
   - **Endgame Strategy:** In the last 10% of rounds, if the stock is above 75% capacity, defect to maximize individual payoff without significant risk of depletion.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate.
   - **Last Few Rounds:** Adjust strategy based on remaining rounds and stock levels as per endgame rules.
   - **Stock Recovery:** Prioritize cooperation if the stock is depleted, ensuring long-term sustainability.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Triggered when more than half of players defect in a round.
   - Defect for up to 3 rounds to punish recent defections, then revert based on current conditions.

4. **Endgame Consideration:**
   - In the final rounds, balance individual gain with collective sustainability by defecting only if stock levels are sufficiently high.

This strategy ensures adaptability, promotes cooperation, punishes defection, and optimizes for endgame scenarios, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while maintaining resource sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_277 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on the game's state and history. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining stock levels for future rounds.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - All players cooperate in the first round to establish a high initial stock level, promoting growth and setting a cooperative tone.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track the stock level after each round to assess sustainability.
   - **Dynamic Threshold:** Use a dynamic threshold based on remaining rounds (r) and capacity (C). Cooperate if the current stock (S) is above a calculated threshold; otherwise, defect. The threshold decreases as rounds progress to adapt to the game's end.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds), all players defect to maximize immediate payoffs when future growth potential is limited.

### Decision Rules:

- **Cooperate** if \( S > \frac{\text{capacity}}{\text{remaining\_rounds} + 1} \)
- **Defect** otherwise

This rule ensures that cooperation occurs when the stock can sustainably support future rounds, and switches to defection when immediate gains are prioritized.

### Edge Cases:

- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is critically low, defecting becomes necessary to secure remaining resources.
- **Final Rounds:** Always defect in the last few rounds to maximize payoffs without concern for future depletion.

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, round_number, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "COOPERATE"
    
    remaining_rounds = r - round_number
    threshold = capacity / (remaining_rounds + 1)
    
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return "COOPERATE"
    else:
        return "DEFECT"

# Example usage in last few rounds adjustment
if round_number >= r - 2:
    return "DEFECT"
```

### Conclusion:

This strategy adapts to the game's progression, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary. It balances individual gain with collective sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors in a tournament setting.

description_COLLECTIVE_278 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first round, all players cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and maximize initial stock sustainability.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**:
   - Track the stock level after each round. If the stock falls below 25% of capacity, switch strategy to defecting in subsequent rounds to capture remaining resources before depletion.

3. **Adaptive Response Based on Consumption**:
   - Calculate total consumption per player each round. If average consumption exceeds a sustainable threshold (indicating others are defecting), adapt by defecting in the next round to avoid being exploited and maximize personal payoffs.

4. **Reciprocal Strategy**:
   - Implement a reciprocity mechanism where if a significant number of players defected in previous rounds, switch to defecting to punish non-cooperative behavior and protect individual interests.

5. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - In the final few rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds), prioritize defecting to maximize immediate payoffs since future stock replenishment is less relevant.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring sustainability while protecting against exploitation by adapting to others' actions and preserving long-term benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_279 = '''
To address the challenge of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game scenario where the resource (stock) can be depleted based on collective actions, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with punishment. This approach aims to maintain resource sustainability while allowing individuals to maximize their payoffs when necessary.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and resource management.
2. **Monitor Resource Trends**: Track the stock levels over time, particularly focusing on whether the stock is increasing, stable, or decreasing after each round's growth phase.
3. **Triggered Defection**: If the stock shows a consistent downward trend (e.g., decreases for two consecutive rounds), defect in the next round to signal dissatisfaction and encourage others to cooperate again.
4. **Resume Cooperation**: After defecting, monitor the stock's response. If cooperation resumes and the stock begins to recover or stabilize, revert to cooperating.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Round 1**: Cooperate unconditionally to initiate trust and observe initial resource dynamics.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - For each round after the first, evaluate the change in stock level from the previous round after growth.
   - Maintain cooperation if the stock is stable or increasing.
   - Defect if the stock has decreased for two consecutive rounds, indicating potential overexploitation by others.
3. **Post-Defection Monitoring**: After defecting once, return to cooperation if the subsequent round's stock level shows improvement. If the stock continues to decline, consider further actions (though beyond the scope here, it might involve extended periods of defection or other mechanisms).

### Rationale:
- **Cooperation** is favored when the resource is plentiful and sustainable, ensuring long-term benefits.
- **Defection** serves as a punitive measure to deter overexploitation and encourage others to return to cooperative behavior.
- This strategy requires minimal information (stock levels) and simple decision-making, making it practical for implementation.

### Conclusion:
This adaptive approach allows individuals to balance self-interest with collective good, promoting resource sustainability while safeguarding against exploitation. It dynamically adjusts based on observable outcomes, ensuring flexibility in a changing environment.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_280 = '''
To address the challenges of the Common Pool Resource Game, we can design an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation and punishment, ensuring sustainability while being robust against various opponent behaviors. Here's a structured approach:

### **Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Gradual Punishment**

#### 1. **Decision Rules**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust and maximize initial payoffs.
- **Stock Threshold Monitoring:** After each round, assess the stock level relative to capacity:
  - If stock is above 90% of capacity, continue cooperating to maintain a healthy resource.
  - If stock drops below 90%, switch to defecting for the next one or two rounds as a form of punishment to deter overexploitation.
- **Gradual Forgiveness:** After punishing, gradually return to cooperation if others reciprocate by not overdefecting. This avoids mutual defection spirals.
- **Endgame Consideration:** In the final few rounds (e.g., last 10%), increase cooperation propensity to preserve remaining stock for equitable payoffs.

#### 2. **Handling Edge Cases**
- **First Round:** Always cooperate to initiate mutual cooperation and set a positive precedent.
- **Last Round(s):** Cooperate more to prevent endgame exploitation, ensuring fairness in final payoffs.
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock is critically low (e.g., below 10% of capacity), consider cooperating to allow regeneration, unless nearing the last rounds.

#### 3. **Collective Alignment**
The strategy encourages a mindset of shared responsibility, aiming for sustained resource use through reciprocal cooperation and measured punishment. It's designed to be adopted by all players collectively to maintain high payoffs over the game.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_cooperation(n, capacity, stock, history):
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return "C"
    
    last_stock = history[-1]["stock_after"]
    rounds_remaining = r - len(history)
    
    if stock > 0.9 * capacity:
        action = "C"
    elif 0.1 < stock <= 0.9 * capacity:
        # Determine punishment period, e.g., defect for next 2 rounds
        if history[-1]["defection_count"] >= 2:
            action = "C"  # Forgive after two defections
        else:
            action = "D"
    else:  # stock <= 0.1 * capacity
        if rounds_remaining < 10:
            action = "C"  # Endgame cooperation
        else:
            action = "D"
    
    return action

# Example usage in a round:
current_stock = ...
history = [...]  # Contains previous actions and stock levels
action = adaptive_cooperation(n, capacity, current_stock, history)
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation:** Builds trust and maximizes initial payoffs.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Adjusts behavior based on resource health to prevent overexploitation.
- **Gradual Punishment:** Deters excessive defection without causing mutual harm.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Prevents last-round exploitation, ensuring fair final payoffs.

This strategy is robust, adaptive, and aligns with collective interests, making it suitable for a tournament setting against diverse opponent strategies.

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Collective Cooperation (ACC) Strategy**

The ACC strategy is designed to balance individual payoffs with collective sustainability in a Common Pool Resource Game. It integrates cooperation, reciprocity, and stock conservation through adaptive decision-making.

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Initial Rounds:** Cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative tone and maintain stock levels.
- **Stock Level Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the stock level after each round. If the stock is above 75% of capacity, encourage cooperation. If it drops below this threshold, switch to defecting for one or two rounds to signal the need for conservation.
- **Reciprocity Mechanism:** Implement a graduated response based on past actions. Cooperate if others cooperated in previous rounds; defect if many defected, acting as a punishment to enforce cooperation.
- **Stock Conservation:** When the stock is below 50% of capacity, prioritize cooperation to allow replenishment.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** All players cooperate to maximize initial stock replenishment.
- **Last Round:** Encourage cooperation by considering future consequences, even though it's the final round, to maintain a positive outcome.

### 3. Collective Alignment:
The strategy promotes a collective mindset by starting with cooperation and adjusting based on group behavior. It incentivizes cooperation through reciprocal actions, ensuring that defection is costly in terms of future payoffs.

This ACC strategy aims to sustainably manage the common pool resource, balancing individual gains with long-term collective benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_282 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can adopt an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with punishment mechanisms to maintain resource sustainability. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACWP)

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C). This sets a starting point of mutual cooperation, aiming to keep the stock at capacity.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Cooperation Monitoring**: Track the number of cooperators in each round based on total consumption observed.
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate over the past rounds.
   - **Decision Rule**:
     - If the average cooperation rate is above 75%, continue Cooperating (C).
     - If the average cooperation rate drops below 75%, switch to Defecting (D) for one round as a punitive measure.
   - **Stock Level Monitoring**: After each round, assess the stock level after growth.
     - If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, prioritize Cooperating (C) in the next round to allow regeneration.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round**: Cooperate to maintain resource health for potential future interactions beyond the current game.
   - **Stock Depletion**: If the stock is near zero, Defect (D) if others are defecting to maximize immediate payoff, but switch back to Cooperating once the stock begins to recover.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation encourages mutual benefit and maintains the resource.
- **Adaptive Punishment**: By punishing when cooperation drops below a threshold, it incentivizes others to return to cooperative behavior without requiring communication.
- **Stock Sustainability**: Monitoring and responding to stock levels ensures that the resource remains viable for future rounds, preventing irreversible depletion.

This strategy promotes sustained cooperation while adaptively responding to both the actions of other players and the health of the common pool resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_283 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we have developed an adaptive and robust approach that balances cooperation and defection based on game state and history. This strategy is designed to be effective in a tournament setting where players may employ diverse behaviors.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Based Thresholds

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline.
   - **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):**
     1. Calculate the stock level after the previous round.
     2. If the stock is below a lower threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), cooperate to allow recovery.
     3. If the stock is above an upper threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), defect if fewer than k players cooperated last round; otherwise, cooperate.
     4. For stock levels between thresholds, decide based on majority action: cooperate if most players cooperated last round, else defect.
   - **Last Round (r):** Always defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **Stock Depletion:** If the stock is near zero, prioritize cooperation to prevent complete depletion and allow recovery.
   - **Final Rounds:** In the last round, defect to secure maximum payoff as there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   The strategy aligns with a collective mindset by encouraging cooperation when the stock is low or when most players have cooperated previously, thus promoting sustainability and fairness.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Determine previous stock level
    prev_stock = history[-1]['stock_after']
    
    lower_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    upper_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    
    if prev_stock < lower_threshold:
        return "C"
    elif prev_stock > upper_threshold:

            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
    
    if current_round == r:
        return "D"

# Example usage in a round
action = adaptive_cooperation_strategy(n, r, capacity, game_history)
print(action)
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins with cooperation to set a cooperative tone and maximize initial stock sustainability.
- **Stock-Level Adaptation:** By monitoring the stock level against predefined thresholds, the strategy adjusts behavior to prevent depletion while allowing for strategic defection when safe.
- **Majority Influence:** In intermediate ranges, following the majority action encourages coordination without assuming others' strategies, enhancing robustness.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Defecting in the final round ensures maximum immediate payoff, acknowledging that future stock preservation is no longer a concern.

This strategy is designed to be both adaptive and resilient, capable of responding effectively to various opponent behaviors while maintaining a balance between short-term gains and long-term resource sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_284 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - All players Cooperate (C). This ensures the game starts with maximum cooperation, aiming to sustain the stock at capacity.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Check:** After each round, evaluate if the current stock is above 50% of capacity.
     - If above 50%, continue Cooperating (C) in the next round.
     - If below 50%, Defect (D) once to signal and adapt to potential non-cooperation.

3. **Trigger Mechanism:**
   - Implement a trigger based on stock level relative to capacity. A drop below 50% triggers a switch from C to D for one round, then revert back if the stock recovers above 50%.

4. **Adaptive Cooperation:**
   - After defecting once, return to Cooperate (C) in the next round if the stock shows signs of recovery (above 50%). This encourages sustainability and adaptability.

5. **Final Round Consideration:**
   - In the last round, if the stock is critically low (below a set threshold), players may choose to Defect (D) to maximize their payoff. Otherwise, Cooperate (C) to maintain fairness.

6. **Robustness:**
   - The strategy adapts based on observed behavior and stock dynamics without relying on communication, ensuring flexibility against varied opponent behaviors.

This collective approach balances cooperation and strategic defection, promoting resource sustainability while adapting to potential non-cooperative actions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_285 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Encourages initial stock sustainability and sets a cooperative tone.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Previous Actions:** Calculate the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - **Defection Threshold:** If more than 50% of players defected last round, defect this round (D).
     - **Rationale:** Prevents exploitation when cooperation isn't reciprocated.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - **Low Stock Threshold:** If stock is below 25% of capacity, prioritize cooperation to allow recovery.
     - **Action:** Cooperate (C) regardless of previous defection levels.
     - **Rationale:** Conservation to prevent depletion and ensure future rounds' sustainability.

4. **Final Rounds Strategy:**
   - **Approach to Endgame:** Start defecting a few rounds before the last round to maximize payoffs without depleting the stock irrevocably.
     - **Rationale:** Balances immediate gain with resource conservation for remaining rounds.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Near Depletion:** If stock is critically low, cooperation is emphasized to prevent collapse.
   - **Last Round Adjustment:** Adaptive defecting in late-game phases to optimize final payoffs without jeopardizing the stock's recovery potential.

**Summary:**
The strategy adapts by reciprocating cooperation unless defection exceeds a threshold, while also conserving when the stock is low. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adjusting behavior based on both historical actions and current resource levels.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_286 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C) to help maintain a high initial stock level, encouraging sustainable use from the beginning.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds don't matter.
   - **Middle Rounds**:
     - Monitor the stock trend over the past few rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds).
     - If the current stock is lower than the average of these past rounds, switch to Defecting.
     - If the stock is stable or increasing, continue Cooperating.
     - Additionally, if the stock drops below a threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), start Defecting immediately.

3. **Threshold Check**:
   - Implement a rule to Defect if the stock falls below a predetermined percentage of capacity (e.g., 30%) to prevent over-depletion.

This strategy balances cooperation with self-preservation, adapting based on observed trends and ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_287 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing immediate payoff with preserving the resource for future rounds, we can implement a threshold-based strategy. Here’s how:

1. **Define a Threshold**: Set the threshold at 50% of the capacity. This means if the stock (S) is above half of its maximum capacity, players will cooperate; otherwise, they will defect.

2. **First Round Action**: In the first round, all players start by cooperating to ensure the resource remains plentiful.

3. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock level \( S \) is greater than 50% of the capacity, each player continues to cooperate.
   - If \( S \) drops below or equals 50%, players switch to defecting to secure higher immediate payoffs before the resource potentially depletes further.

This strategy aims to maintain a healthy stock level when possible and adapt when necessary to optimize individual gains without causing rapid depletion.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_288 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperate-Punish (ACP)**

1. **First Round**: All players Cooperate (C) to initiate trust and maintain a high stock level.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Cooperate (C)** if both of the following conditions are met:
     - The number of defectors in the previous round is less than or equal to half the players (D_count ≤ n/2).
     - The stock level after the last round (S_prev) is at least half of the capacity (S_prev ≥ capacity/2).
   - **Defect (D)** if either condition is not met, indicating either significant defection or low stock levels.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**: All players Defect (D), as there are no future consequences beyond this round.

**Rationale**:
- The strategy starts cooperatively to establish a sustainable resource base.
- It adapts based on both the social behavior of other players and the environmental state, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent overexploitation or punish excessive defection.
- By defecting in the last round, it maximizes immediate payoffs without affecting future rounds.

This approach balances individual gain with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation while being robust against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_289 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing individual payoffs while considering the sustainability of a shared resource over multiple rounds, we propose the following approach:

### Strategy:
1. **Cooperate in Rounds 1 to r-1**: In each round before the last one, choose to Cooperate if the current stock (S) is at least half of its capacity (C). This ensures that the resource remains sufficiently abundant to allow for continued use without premature depletion.
2. **Defect in the Final Round (Round r)**: In the very last round, switch to Defecting to exploit the remaining resource fully, maximizing individual gain as there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for.

### Explanation:
- **Rounds 1 to r-1**: By Cooperating when S ≥ 0.5C, players help maintain a healthy level of the resource, allowing it to regenerate and sustain use over time. This prevents early depletion and ensures that the resource remains available for future rounds.
- **Final Round (Round r)**: Since there are no subsequent rounds, players should Defect to consume as much as possible, maximizing their immediate payoff without concern for future sustainability.

This strategy balances the need to preserve the resource during earlier stages with the opportunity to exploit it fully in the final round, optimizing individual payoffs throughout the game.

To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, I propose the **Adaptive Reciprocity Strategy**. This approach balances cooperation with strategic defection to maintain stock sustainability while maximizing payoffs.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to establish trust and maximize initial stock regeneration.

2. **Stock-Based Adaptation**: After the first round, base your action on the current stock level relative to capacity:
   - If stock is above 50% of capacity, Cooperate.
   - If stock is below 50%, Defect to protect against over-depletion.

3. **Reciprocal Response**: Observe previous rounds' outcomes. If others have defected recently, consider defecting in the next round as a punitive measure, then return to cooperation if stock improves.

4. **Final Round Exception**: In the last round, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since future stock isn't a concern.

5. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After punishing defectors by defecting once, revert to cooperation if the stock begins to recover, allowing renewal of collective sustainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_reciprocity_strategy(game_state):
    current_round = game_state['round']
    total_rounds = game_state['parameters']['r']
    stock = game_state['state']['stock']
    capacity = game_state['parameters']['capacity']
    history = game_state['history']

    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

    # Determine action based on stock level
    if stock > (0.5 * capacity):
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

    # Check for last round to defect
    if current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"

    # Consider past actions and stock trends
    recent_actions = history['actions'][-3:]  # Last three rounds' actions
    recent_stock = history['stock'][-3:]

    if recent_actions.count("D") > 1 and len(recent_stock) > 0:
        if recent_stock[0] < (0.5 * capacity):
            return "D"  # Punish recent defection

    # Forgive after punishing once
    last_action = history['actions'][-1]
    if last_action == "D":
        if stock > (0.3 * capacity):
            return "C"

    return "C"
```

### Strategy Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Sets a cooperative tone, encouraging others to do the same and ensuring stock regeneration.
  
- **Stock-Based Adaptation**: Adjusts behavior based on current stock levels, preventing over-depletion by defecting when necessary.

- **Reciprocal Response**: Punishes recent defections to deter exploitation but forgives if cooperation resumes, promoting sustainability.

- **Final Round Exception**: Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future stock.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, balancing individual gain with collective resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_291 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone and maximizes collective payoff from the start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Observation:** Each player observes all previous actions of other players.
   - **Majority Rule:** In each round after the first, determine if a majority (more than half) of players Cooperated in the previous round.
     - If yes, Cooperate again to maintain high payoffs and stock sustainability.
     - If no, Defect once as a punishment to deter future defection.

3. **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
   - After defecting once, if in the subsequent round the majority returns to Cooperation, forgive by switching back to Cooperate. This allows for recovery of cooperation cycles.

4. **Last Round Consideration:**
   - Maintain reciprocity based on previous actions. If the last round's strategy calls for Cooperation due to prior majority behavior, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect as per the punishment phase.

5. **Stock Threshold Adaptation:**
   - If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, switch to Cooperation regardless of others' past actions to facilitate stock recovery and future payoffs.

This strategy balances reciprocity with adaptability, encouraging cooperation while deterring defection through measured punishment and offering pathways back to cooperation, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_292 = '''
To address the problem of determining an effective strategy in a simultaneous move game where players must decide to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), with the goal of maximizing payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability, we can outline the following structured approach:

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - Begin by Cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and resource maintenance.

2. **Monitor Resource Levels**:
   - After each round, observe the current stock level (S_t) relative to the capacity.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - **If S_t > 75% of Capacity**: Continue Cooperating. This indicates that the resource is being maintained well, and cooperation is beneficial.
   - **If 50% ≤ S_t ≤ 75% of Capacity**: Cooperate with a probability proportional to the stock level (e.g., if S_t = 60%, cooperate 60% of the time). This introduces a nuanced response to moderate depletion.
   - **If S_t < 50% of Capacity**: Switch to Defecting for one round as a punitive measure against those who may have defected, allowing the resource a chance to recover.

4. **Punishment and Forgiveness**:
   - After defecting once, revert back to Cooperating if the stock shows signs of recovery (e.g., S_t increases in subsequent rounds). This prevents perpetual defection and encourages cooperation when beneficial.

5. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Track the trend of the stock level over several rounds. If the stock consistently decreases despite cooperation, consider extending the punitive phase to ensure defectors are adequately discouraged.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages maximum resource sustainability from the start.
- **Stock Level Monitoring**: Uses observable data to make informed decisions, ensuring strategies adapt to game dynamics.
- **Threshold Responses**: Provide a clear rule-based approach, minimizing confusion and promoting consistent behavior.
- **Proportional Cooperation**: Introduces flexibility for situations where full cooperation may not be warranted but outright defection is premature.
- **Punishment Mechanism**: Deters excessive exploitation without leading to mutual defection spirals.

### Conclusion:

This strategy balances the need to maintain resource levels with the necessity of punishing defectors, using observable stock levels as the primary indicator for decision-making. It encourages cooperation while adaptively responding to potential exploitation, aiming to maximize individual and collective payoffs over the game's duration.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_293 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a renewable resource while maximizing individual payoffs in a repeated game scenario with n players over r rounds, each player should adopt the following adaptive strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and maximize collective gains.

2. **Monitor Past Behavior**:
   - Track the total number of defections by all players across previous rounds.
   - If the ratio of defections exceeds 20% of all possible actions (i.e., more than 0.2 * n * t where t is the current round), switch to defecting in subsequent rounds.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring**:
   - After each round, assess the stock level after consumption and growth.
   - If the stock falls below a critical threshold of 50% of its capacity, defect in the next round to capture remaining value before depletion.

4. **Final Round Consideration**:
   - In the last round, if the stock is above the critical threshold, cooperate to ensure a high final payoff without worrying about future consequences.
   - If the stock is below the threshold, defect to maximize immediate gain.

### Strategy Rationale:
This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability. By initially cooperating, players aim to maintain a healthy stock level. Monitoring defections and stock levels allows each player to adapt their behavior, switching to defection if cooperation appears ineffective or if the resource is overexploited. The final round adjustment ensures that players make optimal decisions based on the remaining resource state.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the total number of past defections.
   - Assess the stock level post-growth from the previous round.
3. **Decision Making**:
   - If defection ratio > 20% or stock < 50%, defect in the current round.
4. **Last Round**: Cooperate if stock ≥ 50%; otherwise, defect.

This approach encourages cooperation while safeguarding against overexploitation, ensuring each player maximizes their total payoff across all rounds.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline and promote initial stock growth.

2. **Cooperation Monitoring**: After the initial rounds, monitor the number of players who cooperated in the previous round. If at least half cooperated, continue cooperating.

3. **Punishment Mechanism**: If fewer than half cooperated, defect in the next round as a punishment to deter exploitation.

4. **Stock Level Adaptation**:
   - If stock is above 75% of capacity, cooperate to sustain high levels.
   - If stock is below 25%, switch to cooperation to aid recovery.
   - Between these thresholds, decide based on recent cooperation rates.

5. **Final Rounds**: In the last round, defect to maximize immediate gain since future punishment isn't possible.

6. **Adaptive Forgiveness**: After punishing defectors, return to cooperation if others do so, preventing cycles of defection.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to both stock levels and players' behavior to maintain a healthy resource for continued payoffs.

To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round while managing the stock sustainably, we can use a strategy based on monitoring the total consumption relative to the stock level.

**Strategy:**
1. **First Round:** Always choose Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the total consumption from the previous round.
   - If this total exceeds half of the stock before that round's consumption, choose Defect for the current round.
   - Otherwise, continue to Cooperate.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to maximize collective benefit and maintain the stock level.
2. **Monitor Consumption:** After each subsequent round, assess whether the total consumption exceeded half of the stock from before that round's actions.
3. **Adjust Strategy:** If the previous round's consumption was unsustainable (exceeding half the stock), switch to defecting in the current round to secure personal gains before potential depletion.

**Answer:**
In each round after the first, you should defect if the total consumption in the previous round exceeded half of the stock before that round. Otherwise, continue cooperating. This strategy balances maintaining the stock with protecting your own interests when others overconsume.

$\boxed{\text{Defect if previous round's total consumption exceeded half the stock; otherwise, Cooperate}}$

To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we developed an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observable game state and history. The strategy, named "Sustainable Cooperation with Stock Threshold," is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors while aiming to sustain the common pool resource for maximum long-term payoff.

### Strategy: Sustainable Cooperation with Stock Threshold

#### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round**: All players Cooperate (C).
2. **Subsequent Rounds** (from 2 to r):
   - Let \( S_{t-1} \) be the stock level at the end of round \( t-1 \).
   - Let \( C_{t-1} \) be the number of players who chose to Cooperate in round \( t-1 \).
   - If both conditions are met:
     - The stock level \( S_{t-1} \) is greater than half of the capacity (\( > \text{capacity}/2 \)).
     - At least half of the players cooperated last round (\( C_{t-1}/n \geq 0.5 \)).
   - Then, choose to Cooperate in round \( t \).
   - Otherwise, choose to Defect (D).

#### Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to initialize the game with maximum resource preservation.
- **Last Round (r)**: The strategy remains unchanged; decisions are based on the same criteria as other rounds, focusing on stock health throughout the game.
- **Stock Depletion**: If the stock drops to zero at any point, subsequent rounds will yield no payoff regardless of actions. However, players continue to apply the strategy based on historical data.

### Rationale:
This strategy promotes cooperation when the resource is healthy and a majority have previously cooperated, aiming to maintain the stock for future use. It switches to defection when the stock is low or insufficient players cooperated last round, thereby balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The approach ensures that players adapt their behavior responsively to both environmental conditions and collective actions, fostering a balance between individual payoff maximization and resource conservation.

This strategy is designed to be robust against various behaviors and adaptive to changing game dynamics, ensuring sustainable use of the common pool resource while maximizing individual payoffs over time.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_297 = '''
To address the dilemma of when to cooperate or defect in order to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining a sustainable public resource (the stock), we can implement a strategy based on observing the stock level after each round's growth. Here's the structured approach:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate. This ensures that the stock remains at its maximum capacity, setting a positive initial condition.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - After each round, observe the stock level following growth.
   - If the stock level after growth in the previous round is below 50% of the maximum capacity (threshold), defect in the current round to secure higher immediate payoffs before further depletion occurs.
   - If the stock level is at or above 50%, continue cooperating to maintain sustainability and higher collective payoffs.

This strategy balances individual self-interest with the need to preserve the resource for future rounds, ensuring that cooperation continues as long as the stock remains sufficiently healthy.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_298 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round, we've considered various factors including the stock level, remaining rounds, and inferred behavior of other players. The optimal strategy balances cooperation to preserve resources with self-interest to maximize payoffs, especially near the end.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Round (t=1):**
   - All players Cooperate because the stock is at maximum capacity, and there's no prior history of defection.
   
2. **Subsequent Rounds (1 < t < r):**
   - Calculate the stock level after growth from the previous round (S_new).
   - If S_new > 50% of the initial capacity: Continue Cooperating to preserve the stock for future rounds.
   - If S_new ≤ 50%: Switch to Defecting in this and all subsequent rounds, as preserving the stock is no longer feasible.

3. **Last Round (t=r):**
   - Regardless of the stock level, all players Defect to maximize their final payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

This strategy ensures that players work together until the stock is significantly depleted or until the end, where self-interest takes precedence.

**Answer:**

In each round, Cooperate unless it's the last round or the stock has dropped below 50% of its initial capacity. In such cases, Defect to maximize your payoff.

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate unless it’s the final round or the stock is below 50%; then Defect}}$

description_COLLECTIVE_299 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If more than half of the players cooperated in the previous round, cooperate this round.
   - **Defection Trigger:** If half or fewer players cooperated previously, defect this round.
   - **Stock Recovery Mechanism:** If the stock falls below 25% of capacity (critical level), switch to cooperating for the next few rounds to facilitate recovery.

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

This strategy balances cooperation and defection, promoting stock sustainability while allowing for strategic defects when necessary. It adapts based on both historical actions and current stock levels, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable stock level while maximizing individual payoffs, an adaptive strategy based on recent stock performance is proposed. This approach ensures cooperation when others are contributing to sustainability and switches to defection if overconsumption is detected.

### Strategy:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative foundation.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Monitor the stock remaining after consumption in previous rounds.
   - If the stock remaining after consumption (before growth) falls below half of the capacity for two consecutive rounds, switch to Defecting (D).
   - Otherwise, continue Cooperating.

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and allows maximum stock regeneration.
- **Adaptive Response:** By tracking whether the stock has been consistently overconsumed, the strategy ensures that each player reacts appropriately. If others are not cooperating and causing depletion, the player defects to secure their own interests.
- **Sustainability Focus:** The threshold of two consecutive rounds below half capacity helps prevent overly reactive changes while ensuring timely adaptation when needed.

This balanced approach aims to maintain sustainability while protecting individual payoffs in the face of potential overconsumption by others.

1. **First Round:** All players Cooperate (C) to initiate trust and maintain the stock.
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):** Each player decides based on the current stock level relative to capacity:

To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for maximizing payoffs in a repeated game with a common resource, we can employ a threshold-based approach. This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by monitoring the health of the shared resource (stock level) and adjusting behavior accordingly.

### Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation encourages others to do the same, maximizing collective payoffs from the outset.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** After each round, observe the new stock level (S_new), which is the stock after consumption and growth.
   - **Threshold Check:** Compare S_new against a predetermined threshold, say 75% of capacity (C). This threshold indicates whether the resource is being sustainably used.
     - **If S_new ≥ 0.75C:** Continue Cooperating in the next round. The resource is healthy, so maintaining cooperation benefits all players.
     - **If S_new < 0.75C:** Switch to Defecting in the next round as a form of punishment. This signals disapproval of over-exploitation and encourages others to return to cooperative behavior.

3. **Punishment and Recovery:**
   - Once a player starts defecting, they monitor the stock level in subsequent rounds.
     - If S_new recovers above 75% of capacity after one or more rounds of punishment, revert to Cooperating. This gives cooperators an incentive to resume sustainable behavior.
     - If S_new remains below the threshold, continue Defecting until recovery occurs.

4. **Endgame Consideration:**
   - In the final round (if known), players may choose to defect to maximize their immediate payoff since future sustainability is no longer a concern. However, if the number of rounds isn't predetermined or known in advance, this step may be omitted to maintain cooperation throughout.

### Rationale:

- **Cooperation Threshold:** By setting a threshold at 75% of capacity, players ensure that the resource remains sufficiently abundant for future use while allowing for some flexibility.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** Defecting when the stock falls below the threshold incentivizes others to cooperate by demonstrating the negative consequences of over-exploitation.
- **Recovery Incentive:** Allowing recovery above the threshold encourages players to return to cooperation, preventing the resource from being depleted entirely.

This strategy promotes sustained cooperation while incorporating a deterrent against excessive exploitation, aiming to maximize each player's total payoff over the game's duration.

**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Preservation**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate. All players start by cooperating to establish a baseline of mutual cooperation and maximize initial stock sustainability.
   
   - **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):** 
     - Let \( C_{prev} \) be the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
     - If \( C_{prev} > \frac{n}{2} \) (more than half cooperated) AND current stock \( S > \frac{\text{capacity}}{2} \), then cooperate.
     - Otherwise, defect to either protect the stock or maximize immediate payoff.

   - **Last Round:** Defect. In the final round, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff since there are no future consequences for stock depletion.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate regardless of other factors to initiate cooperation.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below half capacity, switch to defecting to prevent further depletion and secure higher payoffs.
   - **Last Round Defection:** Ensure maximum payoff in the final round without concern for future stock levels.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy is designed for all players to follow, promoting a balance between cooperation when beneficial and defection when necessary.
   - Players adapt based on observed past behavior and current stock health, ensuring robustness against varying opponent strategies.

This approach encourages sustained cooperation while allowing adaptive responses to maintain resource viability and individual payoffs.

To address the challenge of managing a common resource sustainably, an optimal strategy can be developed based on observing the stock level and adjusting behavior accordingly. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate fully by consuming \( \frac{S}{2n} \), where \( S \) is the current stock and \( n \) is the number of players.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Observe Stock Level**: After each round, check if the stock level after regrowth (\( S_{\text{new}} \)) equals the capacity.
     - If \( S_{\text{new}} = \text{capacity} \): This indicates that total consumption in the previous round was sustainable. Cooperate again by consuming \( \frac{S}{2n} \).
     - If \( S_{\text{new}} < \text{capacity} \): This suggests over-consumption occurred. Defect by consuming more than your cooperative share to maximize immediate gain.

3. **Rationale**:
   - Cooperating when the stock is at capacity maintains sustainability.
   - Detecting a drop in stock triggers defection to prevent further depletion impact on future rounds.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Round 1**: All players cooperate, consuming \( \frac{S}{2n} \). The stock remains at capacity after regrowth.
   
2. **Round 2 and Beyond**:
   - If the previous round's stock after regrowth was full (capacity), continue cooperating to sustain the resource.
   - If the stock dropped below capacity, defect in the current round to maximize your payoff before potential further depletion.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adjusting behavior based on observable stock levels.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Triggering**

**Overview:**
This strategy balances cooperation and defection, aiming to sustainably manage the common pool resource while protecting individual payoffs against exploitation.

1. **First Round Action:**

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **If Stock ≥ Capacity/2:**
     - Cooperate if at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round.
     - Defect otherwise, especially if many defected or stock is declining.
   - **If Stock < Capacity/2:**
     - Defect if a significant number (e.g., more than 50%) defected previously or stock trend is downward.

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Defect to maximize personal payoff, acknowledging the game's end and lack of future consequences.

**Considerations:**

- **Edge Cases:** The strategy works across all n≥2 and adapts to different r values.
- **Robustness:** Uses past actions and stock trends to adapt, minimizing exploitation.
- **Stock Dynamics:** Considers recovery potential but prioritizes sustainability through cooperation when feasible.

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative foundation.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If the stock after the previous round is above 75% of capacity, continue Cooperating (C).
  - If the stock falls between 50% and 75%, maintain Cooperation but monitor closely for further declines.
  - If the stock drops below 50%, switch to Defecting (D) for the next few rounds or until the stock recovers above 75%.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Prioritize immediate payoffs by Defecting (D), especially in the final two rounds.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Default to Cooperation to initiate a cooperative tone.

- Adaptive responses ensure that players can adjust based on collective impacts without direct communication.
- Punitive measures through defection aim to conserve stock when depletion threatens future payoffs.

To determine the optimal strategy for each player in the described scenario, we analyze the outcomes based on cooperation (C) or defection (D). The key observations are:

1. **Cooperation (All C)**: Each round, total consumption is 4 units (since n=4 and each C consumes 1 unit). The stock after consumption is 96, and growth brings it back to 100. Each player receives 1 unit.

2. **Defection (All D)**: Each round, total consumption is 8 units (each of the 4 players consumes 2 units). The stock after consumption drops to 92, but growth increases it by 14.72 units, bringing it back to 100. Each player receives 2 units.

Given that defecting yields a higher individual payoff without depleting the resource (due to sufficient growth), the Nash equilibrium is for all players to choose D every round. This strategy maximizes each player's consumption while maintaining the stock at capacity through growth.

   - After punishing by Defecting for one round, revert to Cooperating if the number of Defectors in the subsequent round falls below the 25% threshold or if the stock begins to recover.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **Last Round**: Treat all rounds uniformly, applying the same strategy without special rules for the final round to avoid last-round exploitation.
   - **Low Stock**: If the stock is near depletion (e.g., below 25% of capacity), Cooperate to prevent resource exhaustion.

### Pseudocode Illustration:

```python
def adaptive_cooperate_punish(n, capacity, current_stock, history):
    # Initial round: Cooperate
    if len(history) == 0:
        return "C"
    
    # Previous round data
    prev_actions = history[-1]
    d_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
    
    # Stock check
    stock_threshold = capacity / 2
    if current_stock < stock_threshold:
        # Prioritize Cooperation to regrow stock
        return "C"
    
    # Defector threshold: 25% of players
    defector_threshold = n * 0.25
    
    if d_count > defector_threshold:
        # Punish by Defecting this round
        return "D"
    else:
        # Continue Cooperating
        return "C"

# Forgiveness mechanism applied after one round of punishment
def check_forgiveness(history):
    last_actions = history[-1]
    d_count_last = sum(1 for action in last_actions if action == 'D')
    if d_count_last <= len(history[0])*0.25:
        return True
    return False

# Example usage within the game loop:
current_strategy = "C"
for round in range(game_rounds):
    if round > 0:
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        prev_actions = get_previous_actions()
        d_count_prev = sum(1 for a in prev_actions if a == 'D')
        
        # Apply ACP strategy
        if current_strategy == "D" and check_forgiveness(prev_actions):
            current_strategy = "C"
        elif current_stock < (capacity / 2):
            current_strategy = "C"
        else:
            if d_count_prev > (n * 0.25):
                current_strategy = "D"
            else:
                current_strategy = "C"
    
    # Record action for next round
    record_action(current_strategy)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages a cooperative environment from the start.
- **Defector Punishment**: Deters excessive defection by retaliating when more than 25% defect, maintaining fairness.
- **Stock Prioritization**: Safeguards resource sustainability by focusing on regrowth when stocks are low.
- **Forgiveness**: Allows for recovery and continued cooperation after isolated instances of defection.

This strategy balances the need to maintain resource health with addressing free-riding behavior, promoting a sustainable and fair outcome for all players.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The proposed strategy balances cooperative behavior with adaptive responses to maintain the sustainability of the common pool while maximizing individual payoffs. It is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors and adapts based on game state and history.

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to set a positive tone and maximize initial growth.
- **Middle Rounds:**
  - If the stock is above 50% of capacity, check the number of cooperators in the previous round:
    - Cooperate if most players cooperated.
    - Defect if many defected to prevent over-depletion.
  - If the stock drops below 50%, defect to secure higher immediate payoffs.
- **Last Round:** Always defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- The strategy is designed to handle all n≥2 and r>1, including small numbers like n=2 or r=2.
- It ensures responsiveness regardless of other players' strategies through observation of stock levels and past actions.

### 3. Collective Alignment:
The strategy promotes a collective mindset by prioritizing cooperation when beneficial but switching tactics when exploitation is detected, ensuring both individual and group sustainability.

This approach uses reciprocal altruism and adaptive thresholds to maintain balance between cooperation and self-preservation, making it robust in dynamic game environments.

**Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation (ARC)**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative norm and maximize initial stock sustainability.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - Calculate the expected stock level at the end of the previous round if all players had cooperated. This is done by simulating the stock dynamics with full cooperation.
     - Compare the actual stock level after growth in the previous round to this expected value.
     - If the actual stock is lower than expected, defect (D) in the current round as a punishment mechanism.
     - If the actual stock meets or exceeds expectations, continue cooperating.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Round:** Treat it like any other round; the strategy doesn't require special treatment for the last round since the focus is on maintaining stock health throughout.
   - **Stock Depletion:** If the stock reaches zero, switch to defecting until the stock begins to recover.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy encourages cooperation while incorporating a punishment mechanism to deter defection. It aligns all players towards maintaining a sustainable common pool by using inferred reciprocity based on observed stock levels.

**Pseudocode Explanation:**

```python
def adaptive_reciprocal_cooperation(n, capacity, r):
    current_stock = capacity  # Initial stock level
    for t in range(1, r + 1):
        if t == 1:

        else:
            # Calculate expected stock if all cooperated last round
            prev_expected_consumption = current_stock / (2 * n) * n
            s_remaining_expected = current_stock - prev_expected_consumption
            growth_expected = 2 * s_remaining_expected * (1 - s_remaining_expected / capacity)
            new_stock_expected = min(s_remaining_expected + growth_expected, capacity)

            # Determine if actual previous stock was less than expected
            if current_stock < new_stock_expected:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'

        # Update current_stock based on all players' actions (simulated)
        total_consumption = 0
        for player in range(n):
            if action == 'C':
                consumption = current_stock / (2 * n)
            else:
                consumption = current_stock / n
            total_consumption += consumption

        s_remaining = current_stock - total_consumption
        growth = 2 * s_remaining * (1 - s_remaining / capacity)
        current_stock = min(s_remaining + growth, capacity)

    return action  # Returns the action taken in each round
```

**Summary:**
The ARC strategy promotes sustained cooperation by punishing inferred defection through stock level analysis. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring the common resource remains viable for all players across all rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_313 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to cooperate (C) or defect (D) in order to maximize payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability, we can implement a straightforward strategy based on the current stock level relative to its capacity. Here's how:

### Strategy:
1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C). This ensures initial resource conservation and growth.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (t=2 to t=r-1)**: 
   - If the current stock level is below 50% of the total capacity, Defect (D) to secure higher immediate payoffs.
   - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C) to maintain or grow the stock.
3. **Last Round (t=r)**: Always Defect (D). Since there's no future round, prioritize maximizing your payoff.

### Explanation:
- **Cooperation in Early Rounds**: Maintaining a high stock level early on allows for sustainable growth and ensures that there is enough resource for future rounds.
- **Defection When Necessary**: If the stock drops significantly (below 50% of capacity), defecting helps secure higher payoffs before the resource depletes further, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.
- **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, since there are no future consequences, defecting ensures you get the highest possible payoff.

This strategy balances cooperation to sustain resources while strategically defecting when necessary or in the endgame to maximize payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_314 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     1. Observe the cooperation rate from the previous round (percentage of players who cooperated).
     2. If the cooperation rate is ≥70%, cooperate again.
     3. If the cooperation rate is <70%, defect in the current round to punish defectors.
   - **Stock Check:** After each round, if the stock level after growth drops below 50% of capacity, switch to cooperating until it recovers above that threshold, regardless of others' actions.
   - **Final Rounds:** In the last round (r), defect if the stock is above 50% of capacity; otherwise, cooperate.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Always start with cooperation to encourage a positive initial state.
   - **Last Round (r):** Defect if the stock is sufficiently high to maximize immediate payoff without future consequences.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize stock replenishment by cooperating when the stock is critically low.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy encourages cooperation when beneficial and punishes defection to maintain a sustainable resource, aligning individual actions with collective well-being.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```
Initialize:
    cooperate_threshold = 0.7
    stock_threshold = capacity / 2

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round:
        action = C
    else:
        previous_cooperation_rate = number of cooperators last round / n
        if previous_stock_after_growth < stock_threshold:
            action = C
        elif previous_cooperation_rate >= cooperate_threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D

    if it's the last round (r):
        if current_stock > stock_threshold:
            action = D

    execute action and observe new state
```

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring resource sustainability while adapting to others' behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_315 = '''
To address the dilemma of balancing immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability in a simultaneous-move game without communication, an optimal strategy can be designed based on monitoring cooperation rates and stock levels. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to encourage others and maximize initial resource health.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: Continuously assess the current stock level relative to its capacity.
3. **Cooperation Thresholds**:
   - If the stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), cooperate as long as historical cooperation rates are sufficiently high (e.g., above 70%).
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to defecting to secure immediate gains before potential depletion.
4. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

### Detailed Strategy:
- **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative tone and preserve the resource initially.
- **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to T-1)**:
  - Calculate the average cooperation rate from previous rounds.
  - Assess the current stock level relative to capacity.
    - If above 50%, cooperate if historical cooperation is above 70%.
    - If below 50%, defect to secure higher immediate payoffs.
- **Last Round (Round T)**: Defect to maximize final payoff, as future resource health no longer affects your total payoff.

### Rationale:
- Starting with cooperation encourages initial resource preservation and can foster mutual cooperation.
- Monitoring stock levels ensures that you adapt based on the resource's sustainability, switching strategies when over-exploitation is evident.
- Defecting in the last round aligns with individual rationality to maximize final gains without future repercussions.

This strategy balances reciprocity with self-interest, aiming to maintain resource health while securing optimal personal payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_316 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation (ARC)**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone, encouraging others to do the same and maximizing initial stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t=2 to r-1)**:
   - **Stock Trend Monitoring**: Track whether the stock has decreased for the past two consecutive rounds.
     - If the stock is decreasing for two straight rounds, switch strategy to Defect (D) for the next round.
     - Continue defecting until the stock shows an increasing trend in the most recent round compared to the previous one.
   - **Cooperation Resumption**: Once the stock starts to recover (i.e., increases from the previous round), revert to Cooperate (C).

3. **Final Round Action (t=r)**: Always Defect (D). In the last round, there are no future consequences for overexploitation, so maximize immediate payoff.

4. **Punishment and Forgiveness Mechanism**:
   - After defecting due to a declining stock, monitor if cooperation resumes by checking for an increase in stock.
   - If the stock increases after reverting to cooperation, continue cooperating; otherwise, maintain defection until the stock shows recovery.

5. **Threshold Consideration**: Optionally, use a stock level threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) as an additional check. Cooperate if above the threshold and defect if below, to prevent excessive depletion.

**Pseudocode Outline**:

```
function ARCStrategy(current_round, total_rounds, stock_history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        # Check if stock has decreased for the past two rounds
        recent_decrease = (stock_history[-1] < stock_history[-2]) and (stock_history[-2] < stock_history[-3])
        if recent_decrease:
            # Start defecting until stock recovers
            while True:
                # Simulate next round
                action = "D"
                new_stock = calculate_new_stock(action)
                if new_stock > stock_history[-1]:
                    break
            return "C"  # Resume cooperation after recovery
        else:
            return "C"

def calculate_new_stock(action):
    # Simulates the effect of 'action' on stock
    pass

# Usage example for round t:
stock_history = [100, 90, 85]  # Example stock levels
strategy = ARCStrategy(t, total_rounds, stock_history)
```

**Explanation**: This strategy encourages cooperation initially and in stable times but switches to defection upon observing significant stock declines. It forgives and resumes cooperation once the stock recovers, balancing punishment with recovery incentives. The final round maximizes immediate gain, acknowledging no future consequences.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_317 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can adopt an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maintain resource sustainability while protecting individual payoffs. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)

**1. First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - Rationale: Encourages initial cooperation, setting a positive precedent and maximizing the stock for future rounds.

**2. Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Action Determination:**
     1. Calculate the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     2. If more than 50% of players defected:
         - Defect in the current round.
     3. Otherwise, cooperate.
     - Rationale: This threshold-based approach allows flexibility. Cooperation is maintained when most players are cooperative, while defection serves as a punishment mechanism to deter exploitation.

**3. Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
     - Rationale: Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future consequences, as the game concludes after this round.

### Key Features of ACP:
- **Adaptability:** Adjusts behavior based on previous actions, promoting cooperation while defending against exploitation.
- **Sustainability Focus:** Aims to maintain a healthy stock level by punishing widespread defection, ensuring resource availability for future rounds.
- **Collective Mindset Alignment:** Encourages mutually beneficial outcomes through initial and continued cooperation, with strategic defection only when necessary.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_punishment(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1  # Assuming history is a list of previous rounds' actions

    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == r:
        return "D"
    else:
        prev_actions = history[-1]
        defectors = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == "D")
        defect_threshold = n / 2
        if defectors > defect_threshold:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

# Example usage:
history = []  # Initially empty, will store previous rounds' actions
for round_num in range(1, r + 1):
    action = adaptive_cooperation_punishment(n, r, capacity, history)
    history.append([action for _ in range(n)])  # Append this round's actions to history
```

### Explanation:
- **First Round:** All players cooperate to initialize a sustainable stock level.
- **Intermediate Rounds:** Players mirror the majority behavior from the previous round. If most defected, they defect; otherwise, they continue cooperating.
- **Last Round:** Players defect to maximize their final payoff without future repercussions.

This strategy effectively balances individual and collective interests, promoting long-term resource sustainability while protecting against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_318 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Cooperation with Punishment and Conservation (ACCPC)**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by Cooperating in the first round to establish trust and maximize initial payoffs.

2. **Track Cooperation Rate**: After each round, calculate the average cooperation rate among all players. This is done by counting the number of players who Cooperated divided by the total number of players (n).

3. **Cooperation Threshold**: If the average cooperation rate exceeds 80%, continue Cooperating in the next round. This incentivizes maintaining a high level of cooperation.

4. **Punishment Mechanism**: If the cooperation rate falls below 80%, trigger a punishment phase where all players Defect for a set number of rounds (e.g., 3 rounds). This deters future defection by imposing consequences on those who defect excessively.

5. **Stock Level Adjustment**: Monitor the stock level relative to capacity. If the stock is below 50% of capacity, increase cooperation rates to conserve resources, even if the cooperation threshold isn't met. This ensures resource sustainability.

6. **Exploration Phase**: Periodically (e.g., every 10 rounds), players test others' commitment by defecting once. If others follow with punishment, it reinforces cooperation; otherwise, it signals a need for adjustment.

7. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last few rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds), if the majority of players are Cooperating, continue to Cooperate. If not, Defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff without future repercussions.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
Function ACCPC(n, r, capacity):
    Initialize cooperation rate
    stock = capacity

    For each round from 1 to r:
        if it's the first round:
            action = Cooperate
        else:
            calculate previous_cooperation_rate = (number of C actions last round) / n
            if previous_cooperation_rate > 0.8 and stock > 0.5 * capacity:
                action = Cooperate
            elif punishment_active:
                action = Defect
                decrement punishment counter
            else:
                if stock < 0.5 * capacity:
                    action = Cooperate
                else:
                    if exploration trigger (e.g., every 10 rounds):
                        action = Defect
                    else:
                        action = Cooperate

        record action and update cooperation rate
        if cooperation_rate < 0.8:
            activate punishment for next 3 rounds

    return total payoff
```

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection to maintain resource sustainability while deterring exploitation, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_319 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining a sustainable common resource pool while ensuring fair consumption among all participants, we can implement an adaptive strategy based on reciprocity and observed behavior. This approach balances cooperation with the need to prevent exploitation by others.

### Strategy Implementation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round. All players start with the stock at full capacity, so cooperative behavior ensures a sustainable consumption rate.

2. **Monitor Consumption**: In each subsequent round:
   - Calculate the expected total consumption if everyone cooperated, which is half of the previous stock level (S_prev / 2).
   - Observe the actual total consumption from the change in stock levels and growth dynamics.
   - If the actual total consumption exceeds the cooperative benchmark, switch to defecting in the next round. Otherwise, continue cooperating.

3. **Adaptive Response**: This strategy encourages cooperation unless others are over-consuming, in which case defection is used as a punishment mechanism to protect individual payoffs and maintain resource sustainability.

### Summary:

- **First Round**: Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If the previous round's total consumption exceeded S_prev / 2 → Defect.
  - Else → Continue Cooperating.

This approach promotes mutual cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation, ensuring a balance between individual and collective interests.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_320 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game that is adaptive and robust against various opponent behaviors, we propose the following structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACST)

**1. First Round Action:**
- **Action:** Cooperate
- **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to encourage others to do the same and maintain a high initial stock level.

**2. Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Parameters:**
     - **Stock Threshold:** 50% of capacity.
     - **Cooperation Threshold:** At least half of the players cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Decision Rules:**
     1. Observe the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
     2. Check if the current stock level is above 50% of the game's capacity.
     3. If both conditions are met (stock > 50% and >=50% players cooperated last round), choose to Cooperate.
     4. Otherwise, Defect to protect your own payoff.

**3. Last Round Action:**
- **Action:** Always Defect
- **Rationale:** In the final round, with no future rounds to consider, maximizing immediate payoff is optimal as there's no risk of future punishment or stock depletion consequences.

### Strategy Explanation

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability by adapting based on both the current state of the stock and the observed behavior of other players. It encourages cooperation when it is mutually beneficial and sustainable, while switching to defection when necessary to protect one's own interests. The thresholds for cooperation are set to ensure that the common pool remains viable for as long as possible without overly penalizing temporary defects.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```pseudocode
function ACSTStrategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, round, history):
    if round == 1:
        return Cooperate
    else if round == r:
        return Defect
    else:
        previous_cooperations = count of players who chose C in history[round-1]
        cooperation_rate = previous_cooperations / n
        
        if current_stock > capacity * 0.5 and cooperation_rate >= 0.5:
            return Cooperate
        else:
            return Defect
```

### Summary

The ACST strategy is designed to be adaptive, using both the stock level and the collective behavior of players to decide actions. It starts with cooperation to foster a positive environment, continues cooperating as long as sufficient players do so and the stock remains healthy, and defects when necessary or in the final round to maximize payoffs. This approach aims to maintain sustainability while protecting individual interests against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_321 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in a repeated game with the goal of maximizing one's payoff while considering the sustainability of the shared resource, we can outline the following structured approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning:** Start by cooperating to establish trust and maximize collective payoff without immediate depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Estimated Defectors Calculation:**
     - Calculate the estimated number of defectors from the previous round using total consumption observed from stock levels.
     - If more than half of the players are estimated to have defected, switch strategy to defect in the current round.
   - **Stock Level Threshold:**
     - If the current stock level drops below 50% of capacity, choose to defect to maximize immediate gain due to resource scarcity.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect.
   - **Reasoning:** In the final round, prioritize maximizing personal payoff as there are no future consequences affecting the resource.

### Summary

- Cooperate initially to foster cooperation and resource sustainability.
- Adapt strategy based on others' behavior inferred from stock levels; defect if others exploit or if resources become scarce.
- Maximize personal gain in the last round without concern for future repercussions.

This approach balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring both collective welfare and individual maximization when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_322 = '''
To maintain maximum long-term payoffs while deterring defection, each player should follow this strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to establish mutual behavior aimed at maintaining the stock at full capacity.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each round, observe whether the stock after growth (regeneration) equals the maximum capacity.

3. **Punish Defection**: If the stock drops below capacity in any round, defect in the subsequent round as a collective punishment to deter future defection.

4. **Resume Cooperation**: After punishing once, revert to cooperation if the stock begins to recover towards full capacity, indicating that others are also cooperating again.

This strategy ensures that players collectively maintain high stock levels through cooperation but punish any deviation that harms group payoffs, thus balancing individual incentives with collective well-being.

**Answer:**  
Each player should cooperate unless the stock dropped below capacity in the previous round; then defect once as punishment before resuming cooperation. This balanced approach maximizes long-term gains by deterring defection while allowing recovery when possible.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_323 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable resource while allowing for personal gain, we can implement a balanced cooperative strategy with clear rules. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players Cooperate in the first round to ensure maximum initial stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Cooperate** if both of these conditions are met:
     - The current stock is above 50% of its capacity.
     - Fewer than half of the players Defected in the previous round.
   - **Defect** if either condition is not met.

3. **Final Round (Round r)**: All players Defect to maximize personal gain since there are no future rounds to consider.

This strategy encourages cooperation when the resource is healthy and defection when it's critically depleted or when too many have defected, balancing collective sustainability with individual gain.

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Collective Management for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
To create a robust and adaptive strategy that balances individual gain with collective sustainability of the common pool resource across multiple rounds.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**
The strategy combines cooperation with retaliatory defection, adapting based on observed behavior and stock levels:

#### **A. Initial Cooperation (First Round)**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a norm of collective resource management and maximize initial payoffs.

#### **B. Monitor and Retaliate**
- **Observe Past Actions:** Track each player's history of cooperation (C) or defection (D).
- **Calculate Defection Rate:** Determine the percentage of players who defected in the previous round.
  - If >50% defected, switch to defection for the next round to punish free-riders.
  - If ≤50%, continue with the current strategy.

#### **C. Stock-Level Adaptation**
- **Thresholds:**
  - **High Stock (S ≥ 0.8 * Capacity):** Cooperate to sustain long-term resource availability.
  - **Moderate Stock (0.5 * Capacity ≤ S < 0.8 * Capacity):** Continue current strategy, whether cooperation or retaliation.
  - **Low Stock (S < 0.5 * Capacity):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since the stock is critically low.

#### **D. Last Round Behavior**
- **Action in Final Round:** Always Defect (D)
- **Rationale:** In the last round, future consequences are irrelevant, so prioritize immediate gain.

---

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize personal payoff without future repercussions.
- **Extremely Low Stock (S < 0.1 * Capacity):** Regardless of history, defect to secure any remaining resource.

---

### **3. Collective Alignment**
The strategy encourages cooperation when the stock is healthy and retaliates against excessive defection to maintain fairness and sustainability. It adaptively switches based on both social behavior and environmental state, promoting a balance between individual and collective interests.

---

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def strategy(player_id, n, r, capacity, history, current_stock, current_round):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate number of defectors in the last round
    defectors_last_round = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == "D")
    defection_rate = defectors_last_round / n
    
    if current_stock >= 0.8 * capacity:
        cooperation_threshold = 0.5  # Adjust based on desired conservativeness
        if defection_rate > cooperation_threshold:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
    elif 0.5 * capacity <= current_stock < 0.8 * capacity:
        if defection_rate > 0.5:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
    else:  # S < 0.5 * capacity
        return "D"
    
    if current_round == r:
        return "D"

# Example usage in a round
action = strategy(1, n=4, r=10, capacity=100, history=[["C", "C", "C", "C"], ["C", "D", "C", "D"]], 
                current_stock=75, current_round=3)
print(action)  # Output: "C" or "D" based on the strategy logic
```

This strategy aims to sustain the resource while being robust against exploitation, ensuring both individual and collective benefits over repeated interactions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_325 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining the stock at capacity while maximizing individual payoffs, we can implement a threshold-based strategy. Each player will cooperate if the current stock is above 75% of the maximum capacity (C) and defect if it falls below this level. This approach balances cooperation with self-interest, allowing players to maintain the stock when possible but protecting their own payoffs when cooperation falters.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Threshold Definition:** Set a threshold at 75% of the maximum capacity (C). If the current stock is above this level, cooperate; otherwise, defect.

2. **Cooperation Phase:** When the stock exceeds 0.75C, each player contributes by choosing to Cooperate. This helps maintain or increase the stock towards full capacity.

3. **Defection Trigger:** Should the stock drop below 0.75C, indicating insufficient cooperation from others, players switch to Defecting to secure higher individual payoffs before the stock depletes further.

This strategy is simple yet effective, encouraging initial cooperation while safeguarding against significant depletion of resources.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_326 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with the necessity to maintain a sustainable stock level. The strategy incorporates both the current state of the stock and the historical actions of players to decide whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D). Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative tone and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Level Check:**
     - If the current stock is above 75% of the capacity, cooperate if the majority of players cooperated in the previous round.
     - If the stock falls below 50% of the capacity, defect to prevent over-depletion.
   - **Historical Cooperation Check:**
     - Assess the average cooperation rate from previous rounds. If it's above a certain threshold (e.g., 70%), continue cooperating.
     - If historical cooperation is low and the stock is decreasing, consider defecting.

3. **Last Round Consideration:**
   - In the penultimate round, evaluate the stock trajectory to ensure it doesn't crash in the final round. Adjust actions to maintain sustainability if necessary.

### Decision Rules

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If `stock > 0.75 * capacity` and majority cooperated last round → Cooperate.
  - If `stock < 0.5 * capacity` or (`stock decreasing` and less than half cooperated) → Defect.
  - Otherwise, check historical cooperation rate; cooperate if above threshold, else defect.

### Edge Cases

- **Low Stock:** Prioritize stock preservation by defecting if necessary.
- **High Cooperation History:** Encourage continued cooperation to maintain a healthy stock.

This strategy aims to balance personal gain with collective sustainability, adapting dynamically based on the game's state and history. It encourages cooperation when beneficial while safeguarding against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_327 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual gains with collective sustainability in managing a shared resource over multiple rounds, we can adopt a strategy that encourages cooperation while penalizing excessive exploitation. Here’s a structured approach:

### Strategy: Cooperative Threshold with Recovery Mechanism

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first round, all players cooperate. This maximizes the initial stock and sets a cooperative tone.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**:
   - After each round, calculate the new stock level following consumption and growth.
   - Determine if the stock is above or below a predefined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).

3. **Adjust Strategy Based on Threshold**:
   - **Above Threshold**: Continue cooperating to maintain high stock levels and sustainable growth.
   - **Below Threshold**: Switch to defection for the next round to signal disapproval of over-exploitation.

4. **Recovery Check**:
   - After defecting, monitor subsequent rounds. If the stock begins to recover (i.e., increases towards or exceeds 75% of capacity), revert to cooperation.
   - This allows the resource to regenerate, encouraging a return to cooperative behavior once sustainability is reestablished.

### Explanation

- **Cooperation When Healthy**: By cooperating when the stock is above the threshold, players ensure that the resource remains plentiful and sustainable for future rounds. This behavior incentivizes others to do the same.
  
- **Defection as Penalty**: If the stock falls below the threshold, indicating overuse, switching to defection serves as a penalty. It signals that excessive exploitation won't be tolerated without consequences.

- **Recovery Incentive**: Allowing the strategy to revert to cooperation once the stock recovers encourages players to return to sustainable practices, preventing perpetual depletion and fostering long-term collective benefit.

This approach balances immediate gains with future sustainability, using stock levels as a clear indicator of when to adjust behavior. It promotes cooperation while deterring excessive exploitation, creating a dynamic equilibrium that benefits all players over time.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_328 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observable game state and history. The strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors while promoting sustainability of the common pool.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACST)

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **Threshold-Based Cooperation:** Cooperate if the current stock level is above a certain threshold (e.g., half of capacity). Defect if it falls below this threshold.
  
- **Final Round Exception:** In the last round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Start by cooperating to establish trust and maintain a high stock level.
  
- **Last Round:** Defect regardless of the stock level to secure higher individual payoffs without concern for future depletion.
  
- **Stock Dynamics:** Monitor the stock after each round. If it drops below the threshold, switch to defecting until the stock recovers.

**3. Collective Alignment:**

- The strategy is designed so that all players can independently apply it based on shared information (stock level and remaining rounds). It encourages cooperation when beneficial and adapts collectively when necessary without requiring communication or coordination beyond observing game state.

### Summary

The ACST strategy promotes sustainability by maintaining high stock levels through cooperation but adaptively switches to defection when the stock is at risk, ensuring players are not exploited. In the final round, it prioritizes immediate gain, recognizing no future impact of depletion. This approach is robust, self-enforcing, and responsive to collective outcomes, fostering a balance between cooperation and strategic self-interest.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{Players cooperate unless the stock falls below half capacity, defecting thereafter, and always defect in the final round.}}

To address the challenge of designing a robust and adaptive collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can employ a balanced approach that combines initial cooperation with adaptive responses based on the game's state. This strategy aims to maintain resource sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Based Trigger (ACST)

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same and establish a high stock level.

2. **Monitor Stock Health**: After each round, assess the stock's trend. If the stock is decreasing consistently over recent rounds (e.g., using a moving average), switch to defecting for a few rounds or until the stock recovers.

3. **Stock Thresholds**: Implement thresholds based on the stock level relative to capacity. For example:
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 75% of capacity.
   - Defect if the stock drops below this threshold, indicating potential over-exploitation.

4. **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def ACST_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, history, is_last_round):
    if is_last_round:
        return "Defect"
    
    # Calculate stock trend (e.g., moving average of last few rounds)
    stock_trend = calculate_stock_trend(history)
    
    # Determine cooperation threshold based on capacity
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > threshold and stock_trend is stable or increasing:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages collective resource preservation, setting a positive tone for the game.
- **Stock Monitoring**: By tracking the stock's health through trends, players can infer others' actions and adjust accordingly without direct communication.
- **Thresholds**: Provide clear signals for when to switch strategies, balancing individual gain with collective sustainability.
- **Last Round Defection**: Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive, responding to the dynamic state of the game while promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary.

description_COLLECTIVE_330 = '''
To address the challenges of the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed a collective strategy based on adaptive thresholds and observation of stock dynamics. This strategy aims to balance individual payoffs with resource sustainability by encouraging cooperation when possible and defecting when necessary.

### Strategy Name: **Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)**

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, cooperate.
  - If the current stock is below or equal to 50%, defect.
- **Last Round**: Choose the action that maximizes immediate payoff based on the current stock level.

#### 2. Edge Cases Handling:
- **Stock at 0**: Always defect as there's no resource left to conserve.
- **Final Round Adjustment**: Cooperate if the stock is sufficient; otherwise, defect to maximize final payoff.

This strategy encourages cooperation to maintain a healthy stock while allowing for strategic defection when the resource is under threat, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_331 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic retaliation to maintain a sustainable stock level while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline and observe others' behavior.

2. **Retaliation Mechanism**: In subsequent rounds, monitor the number of defectors from the previous round. If the number exceeds a threshold (e.g., more than 20% of players), retaliate by defecting in the current round to signal dissatisfaction with non-cooperative behavior.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring**: Continuously assess the stock level after each round. If it falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to defecting to prevent further depletion and protect future payoffs.

4. **Final Round Consideration**: In the last round, if the stock is above the critical threshold, continue cooperating to maintain sustainability. If not, defect to maximize immediate payoff without compromising future rounds (since there are none left).

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_number, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        prev_actions = history[-1]
        defector_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
        threshold_defectors = n * 0.2
        stock_threshold = capacity * 0.5

        if current_stock < stock_threshold or defector_count > threshold_defectors:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

    # In the last round, adjust based on stock level
    if round_number == total_rounds and current_stock >= stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages others to reciprocate cooperation from the start.
- **Retaliation Mechanism**: Deters excessive defection by retaliating when too many players defect, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.
- **Stock Level Monitoring**: Ensures that the strategy adapts to the environmental state, preventing irreversible stock depletion.
- **Final Round Adaptation**: Balances immediate payoff with sustainable practices, ensuring responsible behavior even in the last round if the stock is healthy.

This approach fosters cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation, promoting a robust and adaptive collective strategy.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_332 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual gain with resource sustainability in a common-pool resource scenario, we propose a strategic approach that adaptively adjusts behavior based on the current stock level relative to capacity. This strategy encourages cooperation when the resource is plentiful and switches to defection when it becomes scarce, aiming to maximize overall payoff while maintaining resource health.

### Strategy:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock (S) is above 75% of capacity (C), continue cooperating.
   - If S drops below 75% of C, switch to defecting until the stock recovers.

### Rationale:
- **Cooperation Threshold**: By cooperating when S > 75% of C, players help sustain a high resource level, ensuring future payoffs are maximized.
- **Defection Trigger**: When S falls below 75%, indicating potential overuse, players switch to defecting to secure immediate gains before the resource depletes further.
- **Simplicity and Adaptability**: This rule is easy to follow without needing coordination and adapts based on observable stock levels.

### Edge Cases:
- **Last Round Handling**: Maintain cooperation throughout, including the final round, to avoid a last-period problem where defection could lead to rapid depletion without future consequences.

This approach aims to balance individual self-interest with collective resource management, promoting sustainability while allowing for strategic exploitation when necessary.

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Monitoring (ACM)**

**Objective:** To balance individual payoffs with the sustainability of the common pool resource across multiple rounds through adaptive cooperation based on observed actions and stock levels.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

#### **a. Initial Round**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation maximizes initial stock growth, setting a positive trajectory for future rounds.

#### **b. Subsequent Rounds**
- **Monitor Past Actions:** Track the number of players who defected in the previous round.
- **Determine Thresholds:**
  - **Cooperation Threshold (CT):** If ≤ 25% of players defected last round, continue cooperating.
  - **Defection Threshold (DT):** If >25% but <50%, switch to defection for one round then reassess.
  - **Critical Defection Threshold (CDT):** If ≥50% defected, defect in the current round.

#### **c. Stock Level Considerations**
- **Low Stock (S ≤ 20% of Capacity):** Cooperate to allow regrowth.
- **Moderate Stock (20% < S < 80%):** Use defection thresholds as above.
- **High Stock (S ≥ 80%):** Cooperate to maintain sustainability.

#### **d. Endgame Strategy**
- **Last Round:** Cooperate if stock is low or moderate; defect if high.
- **Final Few Rounds (e.g., Last 3 Rounds):** Gradually shift towards cooperation to ensure stock stability for remaining rounds.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round:** Always cooperate.
- **Last Round:** Use the endgame strategy based on current stock level.
- **Low Stock Scenarios:** Prioritize cooperation regardless of others' actions to prevent depletion.
- **High Defection Rates:** Temporarily defect if a significant portion of players are defecting, then revert based on observed behavior.

---

### **3. Collective Alignment**

The ACM strategy is designed to align individual actions with collective sustainability by:
- Encouraging initial cooperation for resource growth.
- Adapting based on others' behavior to prevent exploitation.
- Considering stock levels to balance immediate gains with long-term resource health.

**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Rounds:** Begin by cooperating (C) in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline and sustain the stock.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** In each subsequent round, evaluate if the current stock level is above 70% of the game's capacity.
     - **Above 70%:** Continue cooperating unless recent history indicates a downward trend in stock levels over the past few rounds (e.g., two consecutive decreases), suggesting increased defection among players. If such a trend is detected, switch to defecting (D).
     - **Below 70%:** Switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoffs.
   - **Last Round Strategy:** In the final round, choose the action (C or D) that yields the higher immediate payoff based on the current stock level.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to initiate trust and maintain a high stock level for future rounds.
   - **Last Round:** Evaluate the immediate payoffs of C and D based on the current stock. Defect if it provides a higher payoff, as there's no future impact.

3. **Adaptive Mechanism:**
   - Monitor the trend in stock levels over recent rounds using a weighted moving average or consecutive observations.
   - If a downward trend is detected (indicating potential defection by others), adapt by defecting to protect individual payoffs.

                action = C
            else:
                action = D
                
        history.append(current_stock)
        if t == r:

    return action

def analyze_trend(history):

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, all players cooperate (C). This sets a baseline of trust and maximizes initial stock growth.

  - **Cooperation Threshold:** Calculate the average cooperation rate. If at least 80% of players cooperated and the stock is above 75% of capacity, continue cooperating.
  - **Punishment Mechanism:** If the stock drops below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) due to low cooperation, switch to defecting (D) for one round as a punitive measure.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to establish trust and maximize initial growth.
- **Last Round:** Cooperate to ensure the stock remains sustainable even after the game ends, promoting long-term thinking.

**3. Collective Alignment:**

To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation while deterring defection in a common resource game with perfect information, we can adopt a strategy that balances reciprocity and forgiveness. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust and maximize initial resource utilization.

2. **Monitor Past Actions**: In each subsequent round, each player monitors how many other players defected in the previous round.

3. **Determine Defection Threshold**: Set a threshold (e.g., 20%) for the number of players who defected last round. If this threshold is exceeded:

   - **Punish by Defecting**: All players defect in the current round to punish the free-riders and deter future defection.
   
4. **Resume Cooperation**: If the number of defectors is below the threshold, all players continue cooperating.

To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose the following structured approach:

### 1. Initial Cooperation
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish trust and observe others' reactions.

### 2. Stock Level Monitoring
- **Stock Threshold:** Define a threshold at half of the capacity. If the stock drops below this level, switch to cooperation to allow recovery.
- **Growth Consideration:** Ensure that after depletion, the strategy supports growth by reducing consumption when necessary.

### 3. Adaptive Response Based on Others' Actions
- **Cooperation Continuation:** If a majority cooperated in the previous round and the stock is healthy, continue cooperating.
- **Defection Trigger:** If many players defected and the stock is low, switch to defection temporarily to maximize short-term gains while signaling dissatisfaction.

### 4. Forgiveness Mechanism
- **Re-evaluation Period:** After a set number of rounds of cooperation without improvement due to others' defections, adjust strategy to defect for a round or two to encourage reciprocity.

### 5. Endgame Strategy
- **Last Rounds Adjustment:** In the final few rounds, prioritize cooperation to prevent over-depletion and maximize collective payoffs, ensuring the stock isn't ruined for all players.

This approach balances cooperation and defection, adapting based on real-time conditions to maintain resource sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs. It is robust against various opponent behaviors by being responsive and flexible.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to set a cooperative tone and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - **High Stock (Above 50% of Capacity)**: Cooperate if most players cooperated in the previous round, maintaining a sustainable stock level.

4. **Defection Triggers**: Defect if either the stock isn't high enough or too few players cooperated previously.
5. **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, defect to maximize immediate gain since future rounds don't matter.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, r, history):
    cooperation_threshold = 0.7
    stock_high_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    stock_low_threshold = 0.25 * capacity

    current_round = len(history) + 1
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == r:
        return "D"
    else:
        previous_actions = history[-1]
        previous_cooperation_rate = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'C') / n
        current_stock = history['stock']

        if (current_stock > stock_high_threshold and previous_cooperation_rate >= cooperation_threshold) or (current_stock < stock_low_threshold):
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

### Explanation:

- **First Round**: Cooperate to initiate a cooperative environment.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Monitor the stock level and previous round's cooperation rate.
  - Cooperate if the stock is sufficiently high and most players cooperated, or if the stock is too low needing recovery.
  - Defect otherwise to protect against over-exploitation.
- **Last Round**: Maximize payoff by defecting since there are no future rounds.

This strategy promotes sustainability while adapting to others' actions, ensuring robustness in various scenarios.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperative Sustainability (ACS)**

**Objective:** Maximize total collective payoff by balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the common pool resource through adaptive cooperation and strategic defection.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

**1.1 Initial Cooperation**
- **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a high initial stock level and encourage reciprocal cooperation among players.

**1.2 Stock Trend Monitoring**
- After each round, assess whether the stock is increasing, stable, or decreasing based on the previous rounds.
- Use a moving average of stock levels over the past few rounds (e.g., 3 rounds) to determine the trend.

**1.3 Adaptive Response**
- **Stock Above Threshold and Increasing/Stable**: Cooperate to maintain high payoffs and sustainability.
    - *Threshold*: Set at 75% of capacity.
- **Stock Below Threshold or Decreasing**: Temporarily defect to secure higher individual payoffs while the stock is still sufficient, encouraging others to revert to cooperation.
    - Monitor for a recovery signal (e.g., two consecutive rounds of increasing stock) before reverting to cooperation.

**1.4 Reciprocity and Forgiveness**
- Track the number of players who defected in previous rounds.
- If a significant portion (e.g., >20%) defected, defect in the current round as a punitive measure.
- After punishment, if others revert to cooperation, gradually return to cooperation over subsequent rounds.

**1.5 Last Round Handling**
- **Last Round**: Cooperate to maximize collective payoff, as future stock preservation is unnecessary but cooperation ensures the highest possible final payoffs for all players.

---

### 2. Edge Cases and Special Considerations

**2.1 Stock Depletion**
- If the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 25% of capacity), Cooperate to allow regeneration.
- Avoid defection if it risks depleting the stock too much, as it endangers future payoffs.

**2.2 Punishment and Forgiveness**
- Implement a "forgiveness" mechanism: after defecting once or twice, revert to cooperation if others do so, preventing endless cycles of retaliation.

---

### 3. Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_cooperative_sustainability(n, r, capacity, current_stock, history):
    # Parameters
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # Cooperation threshold
    stock_trend_window = 3       # Number of past rounds to assess trend
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"  # First round: Cooperate
        
    # Calculate stock trend (increasing, stable, decreasing)
    recent_stocks = [history[t]["stock_after"] for t in range(current_round - stock_trend_window, current_round)]
    stock_trend = get_stock_trend(recent_stocks)
    
    if stock_trend == "increasing" or stock_trend == "stable":
        if current_stock >= threshold:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
    else:  # decreasing
        return "D"
        
def get_stock_trend(stocks):
    # Determine trend based on recent stock levels
    pass

# Example usage in a round
current_round = t
action = adaptive_cooperative_sustainability(n, r, capacity, current_stock, history)
```

---

### 4. Explanation and Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to build trust and maximize initial payoffs.
- **Adaptive Response**: Adjusts based on stock trends, ensuring sustainability while allowing strategic defection when necessary.
- **Reciprocity**: Encourages cooperation by reciprocating others' actions, deterring excessive defection through punitive measures.
- **Stock Focus**: Prioritizes stock health to maintain long-term payoffs, defecting only when the stock can sustain it without severe depletion.

This strategy aims to balance individual and collective interests, promoting cooperation while being robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_342 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual payoffs with collective sustainability in the repeated game scenario, we propose a strategy that adapts based on observed stock levels. This approach aims to maximize total payoff by maintaining cooperation when beneficial and switching to defection when necessary.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Cooperate in the first round (C). This maximizes initial payoffs and sets a high starting stock level if all players cooperate.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels:**
   - After each round, observe whether the stock level (S) has decreased compared to previous rounds.
   
3. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - If the stock level is at capacity or increasing, continue cooperating (C).
   - If the stock level starts to decrease consistently over a few rounds, switch to defecting (D) to secure higher immediate payoffs before potential depletion.

4. **Final Rounds Consideration:**
   - In the last few rounds, increase the tendency to defect, as future consequences are limited and immediate gains become more valuable.

### Rationale:
- Early cooperation helps maintain a high stock level.
- Defection is triggered when the stock starts to deplete, indicating insufficient collective cooperation.
- This adaptive strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adjusting based on observed behavior of other players through stock dynamics.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_343 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual payoff with collective sustainability in a repeated game scenario involving a common resource pool, we propose a strategic approach that adapts based on observed behavior and current resource levels. This strategy is designed to encourage cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation by defectors.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate unconditionally. This sets the stage for potential mutual cooperation and avoids immediate depletion of the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):** 
   - **Check Previous Behavior:** Assess whether the total consumption in the previous round was sustainable, i.e., it did not exceed half of the previous stock level.
   - **Evaluate Resource Health:** Determine if the current stock is above a predefined threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity).
   - **Decision Making:** If both conditions are met (sustainable past behavior and healthy resource level), continue to Cooperate. Otherwise, switch to Defecting to protect individual payoffs.

3. **Last Round (Round r):** Always Defect. Since there are no future rounds, maximizing immediate payoff is optimal without concern for sustainability.

### Key Features:

- **Adaptive Cooperation:** Encourages continued cooperation as long as others do not exploit the resource excessively and the stock remains healthy.
- **Trigger Mechanism:** Switches to defection if past actions or current stock levels indicate potential exploitation or significant depletion.
- **Final Round Maximization:** Prioritizes immediate gain in the last round, acknowledging the absence of future consequences.

### Implementation Considerations:

- **Threshold Setting:** The threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity) should be chosen based on empirical testing to balance between maintaining resource health and allowing for reasonable consumption.
- **Observability:** Players must be able to observe or calculate total past consumption accurately to make informed decisions.
- **Forgiveness:** Consider adding a mechanism to revert to cooperation if defectors cease their exploitative behavior, though this adds complexity.

### Expected Outcomes:

- **All Cooperate:** The resource is sustainably managed, maintaining high stock levels throughout the game except for the final round.
- **Some Defect Early:** Leads to earlier switches to defection by others, potentially depleting the resource faster but ensuring individual payoffs are secured before depletion.
- **Last Round Rush:** All players defecting in the last round ensures maximum immediate gain at the expense of future (non-existent) rounds.

This strategy aims to optimize each player's payoff while considering the collective need to maintain a sustainable resource level, providing a balanced approach between cooperation and self-interest.

description_COLLECTIVE_344 = '''
**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Sustainability with Punishment (ASP)

**Objective:**  
To maximize individual payoff while maintaining the sustainability of the common pool resource by encouraging cooperation and punishing defection.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

#### **a. Initial Rounds (First few rounds):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish trust, observe others' behavior, and maintain a healthy stock level for future rounds.

#### **b. Intermediate Rounds:**
- **Monitor the Stock Level and Opponents' Actions:**
  - Track the average payoff per player in previous rounds.
  - Observe how many players defected in the last round.
  - Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.

- **Rules Based on Observations:**
  1. If the stock level is above 50% of capacity and most players cooperated (少于 25% defected) in the previous round:
     - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - **Rationale:** Maintain cooperation if the stock is healthy and others are cooperating.

  2. If the stock level is below 50% of capacity or more than 25% of players defected in the previous round:
     - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - **Rationale:** Protect your payoff when the stock is depleted or when others are defecting.

  3. If the stock level is critically low (close to 0) and most players defected in the previous round:
     - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - **Rationale:** Attempt to recover the stock for future rounds if possible.

#### **c. Last Round:**
- **Action:** Defect (D)
- **Rationale:** In the final round, there is no future benefit to maintaining the stock, so maximize your payoff by defecting.

---

### **2. Edge Cases**

#### **First Round:**
- Cooperate unconditionally to establish cooperation and observe others' actions.

#### **Last Round:**
- Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

#### **Critically Low Stock (close to 0):**
- If the stock is near depletion, cooperate to allow recovery in future rounds. However, if it's the last round, defect regardless of stock level.

---

### **3. Collective Alignment**

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by:
1. Encouraging cooperation when the stock is healthy and others are cooperating.
2. Punishing defectors by defecting when others defect or when the stock is depleted.
3. Attempting to recover the stock when it is critically low, ensuring future rounds can still provide payoffs.

---

### **Pseudocode Example**

```python
def adaptive_sustainability_with_punishment(n, capacity, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Get data from previous rounds
    prev_actions = history.get_previous_actions()
    stock_history = history.get_stock_levels()
    
    # Calculate key metrics
    avg_payoff = sum(stock_history) / len(stock_history)
    defect_rate = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == "D") / n
    
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return "D"  # Defect in the last round
    
    # Current stock level relative to capacity
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    
    if stock_ratio > 0.5 and defect_rate < 0.25:
        return "C"  # Cooperate if stock is healthy and few defectors
    elif stock_ratio < 0.5 or defect_rate >= 0.25:
        return "D"  # Defect if stock is low or many defectors
    else:  # Critically low stock (close to 0)
        if round_number < total_rounds:
            return "C"  # Attempt to recover stock for future rounds
        else:
            return "D"  # Defect in the last round regardless of stock level

# Example usage
strategy = adaptive_sustainability_with_punishment(n=4, capacity=100, current_stock=50, round_number=3, total_rounds=10, history={...})
print(strategy)  # Output: "C" or "D"
```

---

### **Explanation**

This strategy balances cooperation and defection based on the state of the stock and opponents' behavior. It starts with cooperation to maintain trust and a healthy stock but adapts by defecting when others defect or when the stock is depleted. In the last round, it defects to maximize immediate payoff. This approach ensures sustainability while protecting against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_345 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperate-Punish with Stock Monitoring**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first round, all players cooperate (C). This sets a foundation of trust and maximizes initial stock sustainability.

2. **Punishment Mechanism**:
   - For each subsequent round, each player counts how many players defected in the previous round.
     - If more than half of the players defected last round, the player defects (D) this round to punish free-riders and maintain cooperation incentives.
     - Additionally, if the current stock level drops below 50% of the capacity, the player defects to secure a higher payoff before potential further depletion.

3. **Stock Monitoring**:
   - Players continuously monitor the stock level. If it falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), they switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains while balancing long-term sustainability concerns.

4. **Adaptive Thresholds**:
   - The strategy incorporates adaptive elements, adjusting thresholds based on game progression. Earlier rounds may be more lenient towards defections, while later rounds enforce stricter cooperation as the end nears.

5. **Final Rounds Consideration**:
   - In the last round, players cooperate to maintain stock health, acknowledging that future consequences are irrelevant but aiming to preserve resource viability for other players.

This strategy balances cooperation and punishment, ensuring that players act in their self-interest while preserving the common pool resource for sustained payoffs across all rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_346 = '''
To design a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we aim to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the common pool. The strategy must be adaptive, robust against various opponent behaviors, and based solely on game parameters, state, and history.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
**a. Initial Rounds (First Few Rounds):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Reasoning:** Start by cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and observe others' behavior without immediately escalating into defection.

**b. Steady State:**
- **Monitor Cooperation Rate:** Track the average cooperation rate of other players over the past few rounds.
- **Threshold Check:** If the average cooperation rate falls below a threshold (e.g., 50%), switch to defecting for a set number of rounds (e.g., 3 rounds).
- **Punishment Phase:** During punishment rounds, defect to impose costs on defectors and signal the consequences of non-cooperative behavior.
- **Resume Cooperation:** After punishing, revert to cooperation if others' cooperation rate improves.

**c. Sustainability Check:**
- **Stock Level Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the stock level after each round.
- **Sustainability Threshold:** If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to cooperation regardless of others' actions to allow the stock to recover.

#### 2. Edge Cases:
**a. First Round:**
- **Action:** Cooperate
- **Reasoning:** Start with cooperation to set a positive tone and gather information on others' initial moves.

**b. Last Round (r):**
- **Action:** Cooperate
- **Reasoning:** In the final round, prioritize maximizing the total payoff by maintaining a higher stock level for the last payout.

#### 3. Collective Alignment:
The strategy is designed to align with the collective mindset of sustaining the common pool while adapting to others' actions. It encourages cooperation but punishes defection to maintain fairness and long-term payoffs.

### Pseudocode:

```
Initialize:
- cooperation_threshold = 0.5
- punishment_rounds = 3
- sustainability_threshold = 0.2 * capacity

For each round from 1 to r:
    If it's the first round:
        Choose C
    Else if current stock < sustainability_threshold:
        Choose C
    Else:
        Calculate average cooperation rate of others in past rounds
        If average cooperation rate < cooperation_threshold and not in punishment phase:
            Start punishment phase
            Choose D for punishment_rounds
        Elif in punishment phase:
            Choose D
        Else:
            Choose C

After each round:
    Update cooperation rate history
    Monitor stock level
```

### Summary:

The **Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)** strategy begins with cooperation to foster trust and sustainability. It monitors others' actions, punishing defection to maintain fairness while ensuring the common pool remains viable for future rounds. This approach balances individual gains with collective well-being, adapting as needed based on game state and history.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_347 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on the game's state and history. This strategy aims to sustain the resource while protecting individual payoffs when others defect excessively.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first few rounds to establish trust and allow the stock to grow.
2. **Monitor Stock Trends**: After each round, assess whether the stock is above or below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) and monitor its trend over time.
3. **Adaptive Response**:
   - If the stock remains healthy and stable, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock depletes significantly (below threshold and decreasing), switch to defecting for a few rounds to protect your payoffs.
4. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After defecting, monitor if others resume cooperation (indicated by stock recovery). If so, revert to cooperation.

### Decision Rules

1. **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate in the first round to maximize initial growth and encourage cooperation.
2. **Stock Threshold Check**: After each subsequent round, check if the stock is below a specified threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) and if it's decreasing over multiple rounds.
3. **Switch Strategy**:
   - If the stock is below the threshold and depleting, defect to increase immediate payoffs.
   - If the stock recovers above the threshold, revert to cooperation.
4. **Last Round Consideration**: In the final round, consider defecting if the stock is low to maximize immediate payoff, but continue as per strategy if the stock is healthy.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def common_pool_strategy(current_stock, capacity, history, current_round, total_rounds):
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity  # Adjust based on desired sensitivity
    recent_rounds = 3  # Number of past rounds to consider
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate average stock over recent rounds
    avg_stock = sum(history['stock'][-recent_rounds:]) / recent_rounds
    
    if avg_stock < threshold and current_stock < threshold:
        # Stock is depleting; defect to protect payoff
        return "D"
    else:
        # Stock is sustainable; cooperate
        return "C"

def update_history(stock, action, history):
    history['stock'].append(stock)
    history['actions'][action] += 1

# Example usage
history = {
    'stock': [100.0],  # Initial stock
    'actions': {'C': 0, 'D': 0}
}

for round in range(2, total_rounds + 1):
    action = common_pool_strategy(history['stock'][-1], capacity, history, round, total_rounds)
    update_history(stock_after_action, action, history)
```

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round**: Always cooperate to build trust.
- **Last Round**: If the stock is low, defecting may be beneficial; otherwise, continue as per strategy.
- **Stock Recovery**: After defecting, monitor if others' cooperation leads to stock recovery and adjust accordingly.

This strategy ensures that players act collectively to maintain the resource while adapting to others' actions, enhancing robustness against various behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_348 = '''
**Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold**

This strategy is designed to balance individual payoffs with collective sustainability by adapting behavior based on the current stock level and the game's progress.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establishes trust and maximizes initial stock growth, setting a foundation for future sustainability.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Action:** 
     - If the current stock level is above or equal to 50% of the game's capacity, Cooperate (C).
     - If the current stock level falls below 50% of capacity, Defect (D).
   - **Rationale:** Cooperating when the stock is healthy maintains its sustainability. Defecting when the stock is low helps secure payoffs before depletion.

3. **Final Rounds (Last two rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** In the last stages of the game, with no future rounds to consider, defecting maximizes immediate payoffs as there's no subsequent punishment.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate trust and stock growth.
- **Last Two Rounds:** Switch to Defect to capitalize on remaining resources without concern for future consequences.
- **Stock Threshold:** The 50% threshold serves as a clear indicator of when the stock's health requires a shift in strategy from cooperation to defection.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def determine_action(round, stock, capacity, total_rounds):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round > (total_rounds - 2):
        return "D"
    else:
        if stock >= 0.5 * capacity:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

### Strategy Overview:

This strategy begins with cooperation to build a sustainable resource base, adapts based on the stock's health by defecting when necessary to prevent over-depletion, and transitions to maximizing payoffs in the final rounds. It balances individual incentives with collective well-being through clear thresholds and adaptive decision-making.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_349 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we can employ an adaptive strategy that balances individual payoffs with collective sustainability. The strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors while ensuring the stock remains at a healthy level for future rounds.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to set a precedent for cooperation and observe others' behavior.
2. **Stock Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the current stock level and its trend over recent rounds.
3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability while allowing moderate consumption.
   - If the stock falls below 50% but remains above 25%, switch to Defecting for one round as a response to potential over-exploitation.
   - If the stock drops below 25%, revert to Cooperation to help rebuild the stock.
4. **Endgame Adjustment**: In the last few rounds (e.g., final three rounds), if the stock is above 50% of capacity, players may choose to Defect to maximize short-term gains without significantly harming long-term sustainability.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to encourage initial cooperation.
- **Last Few Rounds**: If the stock is sufficiently high, defect strategically to increase immediate payoffs.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Prioritize Cooperation when the stock is critically low to allow recovery and prevent collapse.

This strategy aims to maintain a balance between individual gain and collective resource management, ensuring that the common pool remains viable for all players across all rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_350 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining cooperation in a shared resource game where players can choose to cooperate or defect, we propose a strategy based on reciprocity and deterrence. This approach aims to maximize long-term payoffs by encouraging sustained cooperation while penalizing deviations.

### Strategy: Cooperative Reciprocity with Forgiveness

1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust and maximize initial payoffs.

2. **Monitor Consumption**: After each round, calculate the total consumption. If it exceeds what would be expected under full cooperation (i.e., if more than half of the previous stock was consumed), it indicates that some players defected.

3. **Retaliate with Defection**: If defection is detected in a round, all players defect in the next round as a form of punishment to deter future defections.

4. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After retaliating, if subsequent rounds show consistent cooperation (total consumption at or below expected levels), players revert to cooperating. This allows the group to recover from isolated instances of defection without entering a cycle of perpetual retaliation.

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, players set a baseline of trust and maximize initial resource utilization.
  
- **Monitoring and Retaliation**: Each player calculates past consumption to detect defections. If overconsumption occurs, defection in the next round serves as a deterrent, signaling that non-cooperative behavior will not be tolerated without consequences.

- **Forgiveness**: To avoid perpetual cycles of defection, players return to cooperation once sufficient rounds of proper resource management are observed. This encourages a return to mutually beneficial behavior after isolated incidents.

### Example

1. **Round 1**: All cooperate.
2. **Round 2**: Calculate total consumption from Round 1. If it matches the expected cooperative level, continue cooperating.
3. **Round 3**: If Round 2's consumption was higher than expected, defect in Round 3.
4. **Subsequent Rounds**: After defecting, monitor future rounds. If several consecutive rounds meet cooperation standards, revert to cooperation.

This strategy balances immediate deterrence with the possibility of recovery, promoting a stable environment where cooperation is incentivized through mutual accountability and forgiveness.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_351 = '''
To address the challenge of sustaining cooperation while adapting to potential defections in a repeated common pool resource game, we propose the following strategic approach:

### Strategic Approach:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating in the first round. This sets a high initial stock level and encourages mutual benefit.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each round, observe whether the stock after growth meets or exceeds the capacity (C). This is crucial for determining the next action.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision**:
   - If the stock after growth in the previous round (S_prev) is at least equal to the capacity (C), continue cooperating.
   - If S_prev drops below C, switch to defecting in the current round to protect individual payoffs and prevent further depletion.

4. **Prevent Rapid Depletion**: To avoid a downward spiral where everyone defects once the stock dips slightly, introduce a threshold. For example, only defect if S_prev falls below 90% of C. This allows minor fluctuations without triggering mass defection.

### Strategy Summary:
- **Cooperate** if the previous round's stock after growth was ≥ 0.9 * Capacity.
- **Defect** if it was < 0.9 * Capacity to balance personal gain and resource sustainability.

This approach balances cooperation with strategic defection, aiming to maintain a stable stock level while adapting to others' actions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_352 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to consider factors such as current stock levels, past player behavior, and the number of rounds remaining. The goal is to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining the sustainability of the common resource.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a high initial stock level, promoting future growth.
2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: For subsequent rounds (excluding the last), decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock level and the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
3. **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there is no future growth post this round.
4. **Stock Threshold Check**: Use a threshold (e.g., half of the capacity) to determine if the stock level is sufficient for cooperation.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round**:
   - Always cooperate to set a positive initial condition for resource sustainability.
   
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to R-1)**:
   - If the current stock is above half of the capacity and at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating.
   - Otherwise, defect to avoid exploitation or due to insufficient stock levels.

3. **Last Round (Round R)**:
   - Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences beyond this round.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the current stock is zero, cooperate as defecting provides no additional benefit and may help others avoid further depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

        threshold = capacity / 2
        
        if current_stock > threshold and previous_coop >= len(previous_actions)/2:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

### Explanation:

- **First Round**: Cooperation sets a high initial stock, encouraging sustainable use.
- **Middle Rounds**: The strategy adapts by cooperating only when the stock is healthy and enough players previously cooperated. This balances immediate gains with resource conservation.
- **Last Round**: Defection ensures maximum individual payoff without considering future rounds.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles situations where the stock is depleted by choosing cooperation to avoid further harm.

This strategy aims to balance individual self-interest with collective resource management, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior and environmental conditions.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C). All players start by consuming stock/(2n).

2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision Rules**:
   - After each round, calculate the expected new stock if all players had cooperated in the previous round.
     - Compute total consumption as S_t/2.
     - Calculate remaining stock: S_remaining = S_t - (S_t/2) = S_t/2.
     - Determine growth: 2 * S_remaining * (1 - S_remaining/capacity).
     - Expected new stock: min(S_remaining + growth, capacity).
   - Compare the actual new stock with the expected value:
     - If actual < expected, defect in the next round.
     - Otherwise, continue cooperating.

3. **Last Round Action**: Cooperate to ensure a sustainable end and maintain a good final payoff.

4. **Low Stock Protocol**: If the current stock falls below capacity/2, switch to cooperating to allow replenishment, regardless of previous defections.

This strategy promotes cooperation, punishes detected defection, forgives to prevent cycles of retaliation, and ensures sustainability, especially in critical conditions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_354 = '''
**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Threshold-Based Cooperation:** Cooperate if the current stock is above 75% of capacity. Defect if it falls below this threshold to prevent further depletion.
   - **Adaptive Response:** Adjust the cooperation threshold dynamically based on the number of players (n). The threshold decreases slightly with more players, as individual impact lessens.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to maintain maximum stock and encourage initial trust.
   - **Last Round Consideration:** Continue using the same strategy even in later rounds to preserve long-term payoffs through a healthy stock.

3. **Adaptive Mechanism:**
   - Monitor the stock level after each round. Use a moving average of past stock levels to identify trends, ensuring decisions are based on sustained changes rather than fleeting fluctuations.
   - Forgiveness Mechanism: Revert to cooperation if the stock recovers above the threshold after a period of defection.

4. **Pseudocode Structure:**
   ```pseudocode
   Initialize:
     cooperate = True
     stock_history = [capacity]
   
   For each round from 1 to r:
       If it's the first round:
           choose C
       Else:
           current_stock = previous stock after consumption and growth
           avg_stock = average(stock_history)
           
           if avg_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
               choose C
           else:
               choose D
   
       Update stock_history with new stock level
   ```

5. **Robustness:**
   Designed to adapt whether others cooperate or defect, ensuring sustainability and maximizing individual payoffs by responding dynamically to stock health.

This strategy balances cooperation for sustainability while protecting against excessive depletion through defection when necessary, adapting to maintain robust performance across various scenarios.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACS)**

The ACS strategy is designed to balance individual gain with collective sustainability in a repeated Common Pool Resource Game. It adapts based on the current stock level, past players' actions, and the game's progression.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate.
   - Start by cooperating to encourage initial resource conservation and establish potential cooperation norms.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Cooperate** if both of the following conditions are met:
     a. The current stock level is above 50% of the game's capacity.
     b. At least half of the players cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Defect** if either condition is not met.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Always Defect.
   - Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages resource conservation and sets a cooperative tone, hoping others will reciprocate.
- **Stock Threshold**: Maintaining the stock above 50% ensures sustainability, allowing for continued growth and future payoffs.
- **Reciprocity Mechanism**: Cooperates only if enough players (at least half) have previously cooperated, promoting fairness and discouraging exploitation.
- **Final Round Defection**: Maximizes immediate gain without concern for future consequences.

### Edge Cases:

- If the stock drops below 50% of capacity at any point, players defect to secure higher individual payoffs, preventing further depletion.
- The strategy adaptively switches based on observed cooperation levels and resource health, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

This strategy is collective, adaptive, and robust, aligning individual actions with the common goal of resource sustainability while protecting against exploitation.
'''

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Each player uses a dynamic threshold based on the stock level relative to capacity and the number of remaining rounds.
   - If the stock is above 70% of capacity, Cooperate (C) to sustain future payoffs.
   - If the stock falls below 70%, Defect (D) to maximize immediate gain.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** All players start with Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
   - **Last Round:** Regardless of stock level, all players Defect to secure final payoffs.
   - **Stock Near Capacity:** Encourage continued cooperation by maintaining the threshold.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to defection to prevent further depletion and maximize individual gain.

3. **Collectiveness:**
   - Players monitor past actions and adjust their thresholds based on collective behavior.
   - If a significant number of players defected in previous rounds, lower the cooperation threshold to adapt to potential exploitation.

4. **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    remaining_rounds = r - len(history)
    
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    else:
        threshold = 0.7 * capacity
        
    if current_stock > threshold and remaining_rounds > 1:
        # Cooperate to sustain stock
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Defect to maximize immediate payoff
        return 'D'

# Example usage in a round:
n_players = 4
capacity = 100
history = [{'stock': 100}, {'stock': 90}]  # Previous rounds' stock levels

action = strategy(n_players, 10, capacity, history)
print(action)  # Output: 'C' if above threshold, else 'D'

This strategy balances individual gain with collective sustainability by adaptively responding to the game's state and history.

description_COLLECTIVE_357 = '''
To design an effective collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance cooperation to maintain stock levels with the ability to adapt when others defect or when the stock is at risk. The strategy must be robust against various opponent behaviors without relying on coordination.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold and Defection Punishment

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C). This encourages initial cooperation and sets a positive tone.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Cooperate** unless one of the following conditions is met:
     - The number of players who defected in the previous round exceeds half of the total players (i.e., more than n/2).
     - The current stock level drops below half of the capacity (S < capacity/2).

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Always Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds, maximizing immediate payoff is optimal.

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation encourages others to do the same and helps maintain a healthy stock.
  
- **Adaptive Mechanism:** By defecting when too many have defected or the stock is low, players protect themselves from being exploited and prevent stock depletion. This incentivizes others to cooperate to avoid mutual defection.

- **Final Round Defection:** In the last round, there’s no future impact, so defecting maximizes immediate gain without long-term consequences.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1  # Assuming history starts empty
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    elif current_round == r:
        return "D"
    
    else:
        previous_actions = history[-1]
        defectors_last_round = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
        
        stock_after_last_round = calculate_stock_after_last_round()
        
        if defectors_last_round > n / 2 or stock_after_last_round < capacity / 2:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

def calculate_stock_after_last_round():
    # Implement logic to compute the current stock level based on previous rounds' actions
    pass
```

**Explanation:**

- **First Round:** All players cooperate, setting a cooperative tone.
  
- **Middle Rounds:** Players monitor previous actions and stock levels. If too many defected or the stock is low, they defect to protect their interests; otherwise, they continue cooperating.

- **Last Round:** Everyone defects to maximize their final payoff since there’s no future impact on the stock.

This strategy promotes sustained cooperation while being robust against exploitation, ensuring a balance between collective and individual rationality.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_358 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to cooperate or defect in a repeated game with a finite number of rounds, we can use an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation and punishment. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, always cooperate. This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes joint payoffs early on.

2. **Punishment Mechanism**: For each subsequent round except the last:
   - Calculate the stock change from the previous round.
   - If the stock drops by more than a predefined threshold (e.g., 10% of the initial capacity), defect in the current round as a form of punishment for perceived defection.

3. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, always defect to maximize your immediate payoff since there are no future consequences or rounds left to punish.

This strategy encourages cooperation while deterring excessive defection by imposing penalties when the stock significantly decreases, balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_359 = '''
To maximize the total payoff over all rounds while ensuring fairness and discouraging exploitation, each player should follow this strategy:

1. **First Round:** Always cooperate (C). This sets a baseline of mutual cooperation to maintain the stock at capacity.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If in any previous round, the total consumption exceeded half of that round's stock (S/2), indicating that at least one player defected, then defect (D) in this round and all subsequent rounds.
   - If no prior defection has occurred (i.e., all previous rounds had total consumption exactly at S/2 or less), continue cooperating.

This strategy ensures that once any player defects, everyone defects thereafter to prevent being exploited. While it leads to a lower total payoff than sustained cooperation, it is individually rational and discourages unilateral exploitation.

**Final Answer:**

Each player should cooperate in the first round and continue doing so unless any previous round had total consumption exceeding half of the stock, in which case they should defect permanently thereafter. This strategy can be succinctly described as:

- **First Round:** Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** Defect if there was any prior defection; otherwise, cooperate.

The final answer is represented as \boxed{C} for the first round and switches to \boxed{D} if any prior defection occurred.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_360 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACwP)**

### 1. Decision Rules
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to initialize trust and maximize collective payoff.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If in the previous round, at least half of players cooperated AND the stock increased or stayed the same:
    - Continue Cooperating (C).
  - If in the previous round, fewer than half cooperated OR the stock decreased significantly:
    - Defect (D) to punish defectors and prevent stock depletion.
  
- **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future consequences are irrelevant.

### 2. Edge Cases
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to establish trust.
- **Last Round:** Switch to defection to secure maximum personal gain.
- **Stock Depletion (stock ≤ 0):** Cooperate for the next round to allow stock recovery, ensuring sustainability.

### 3. Collective Alignment
This strategy promotes collective welfare by encouraging cooperation when beneficial and punishing defectors to maintain a healthy stock level. It is adaptive, responding to the actions of others while ensuring individual payoffs are maximized over time.

---

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def ACwPStrategy(n, capacity, r, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Analyze previous round's cooperation rate and stock change
    prev_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    cooperators = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'C')
    prev_stock = history[-1]['stock_after']
    curr_stock = history[-1]['new_stock']
    
    if (cooperators >= n/2) and (curr_stock >= prev_stock):
        return "C"
    else:
        # Check if it's the last round
        if current_round == r:

        else:
            # Defect as punishment
            return "D"
    
    # Handle stock depletion
    if curr_stock <= 0 and current_round < r:
        return "C"

# Example usage in a tournament setting
strategy = ACwPStrategy(n, capacity, r, history)

This strategy is designed to be robust against various behaviors while promoting sustainable resource use, ensuring both individual and collective gains over the game's duration.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_361 = '''
To address the problem, I propose a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that balances cooperation with self-protection. This approach is adaptive, considering both current conditions and past player behavior.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial collective benefit.
   
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Level Check:** If the stock is above two-thirds of capacity, cooperate if fewer than half defected previously; otherwise, defect.
   - **Low Stock Scenario:** If the stock drops below one-third of capacity, switch to defecting to protect individual payoff.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate gain, as future consequences are irrelevant after the last round.

### Decision Rules:

- **Cooperate** if:
  - In the first round.
  - Stock > 2/3 capacity and <50% defected previously.
  
- **Defect** if:
  - Stock ≤ 1/3 capacity.
  - ≥50% defected in previous rounds.
  - It's the final round.

### Rationale:

This strategy encourages cooperation when sustainable, adapts to others' actions to prevent exploitation, and ensures maximum personal gain in the last round. The thresholds (two-thirds, one-third) are starting points that can be adjusted based on performance testing.

### Conclusion:

The proposed strategy is proactive in conserving resources, responsive to others' behavior, and pragmatic in the final round, aiming to balance collective benefit with individual protection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_362 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a robust and adaptive collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose the following structured approach:

### Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACWP)

**1. First Round Action:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** All players start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust and maximize initial payoffs.

**2. Subsequent Rounds Decision Rules:**
   - **Monitor Previous Cooperation:** Track the number of players who cooperated in the previous round (C_prev).
   - **Threshold Check:** If C_prev is at least 80% of n (i.e., C_prev ≥ 0.8n), continue to Cooperate.
   - **Punishment Mechanism:** If fewer than 80% cooperated:
     - **Defect for Punishment:** Defect for the next two rounds to penalize defectors and deter future non-cooperative behavior.
   - **Stock Conservation:** If the current stock level drops below 50% of capacity, switch to Cooperate temporarily to facilitate stock replenishment.

**3. Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round Consideration:** Even in the final round, if the stock is low, cooperate to end on a sustainable note.
   - **Stock Recovery:** After punishing, monitor stock levels and revert to cooperation once conditions improve to allow recovery.

### Strategy Overview

- **Cooperation Threshold (80%):** Encourages high levels of cooperation unless a significant number defect.
- **Punishment Period (2 Rounds):** Sufficient to impact defectors without causing irreparable harm to the resource.
- **Stock Conservation (Below 50% Capacity):** Ensures that the strategy prioritizes sustainability when the stock is critically low.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def acwp_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, previous_actions, round_num):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate number of cooperators in the previous round
    c_prev = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'C')
    
    # Check if cooperation threshold is met
    if c_prev >= 0.8 * n:
        return "C"
    else:
        # Determine if stock conservation is needed
        if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return "C"
        else:
            # Defect for punishment period
            return "D"

# Example usage in a simulation loop
previous_actions = []
for round_num in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    actions = [acwp_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, previous_actions, round_num) for _ in range(n)]
    # Update game state and previous_actions
    previous_actions = actions
```

### Conclusion

This strategy effectively balances punishment for defectors with conservation efforts when the stock is low. It is adaptive, adjusting based on both past cooperation levels and current resource conditions, ensuring a sustainable approach to maintaining high payoffs over time.

description_COLLECTIVE_363 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining optimal play in a multiplayer setting where each player must decide to cooperate or defect, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, we propose the following structured strategy:

### Strategy: Cooperative Punishment with Forgiveness (CPwF)

1. **First Round**: Cooperate.
   - All players begin by cooperating to establish a cooperative foundation and maximize initial resource regrowth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Let \( S_{prev} \) be the stock at the start of the previous round.
   - Calculate \( C_{prev} \), the total consumption in the previous round.
     - \( C_{prev} = \sum \text{individual consumptions} \).
     - Determine if overconsumption occurred: If \( C_{prev} > S_{prev}/2 + \epsilon \) (where \( \epsilon \) is a small buffer, e.g., 5% of \( S_{prev}/2 \)).
   - Decision:
     - If overconsumption occurred, defect in the current round to punish and signal disapproval.
     - Otherwise, continue cooperating.

3. **Post-Punishment Monitoring**:
   - After defecting once due to overconsumption, monitor subsequent rounds' consumptions.
   - If any subsequent round's consumption \( C_{new} \) is less than or equal to the current stock \( S_{current}/2 \), revert to cooperation.

### Explanation and Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation encourages resource growth and sets a cooperative tone, which can lead to higher payoffs if maintained.
  
- **Overconsumption Check**: By comparing total consumption against half of the previous stock (\( S_{prev}/2 \)), we identify when collective action exceeds sustainable levels. The buffer \( \epsilon \) allows for minor fluctuations without triggering punishment.

- **Punishment by Defection**: Defecting once sends a signal to other players about the consequences of overexploitation, aiming to deter future excessive consumption.

- **Forgiveness and Reversion**: Monitoring after punishment allows for flexibility. If others reduce their consumption, cooperation resumes, preventing mutual destruction and allowing resource recovery.

This strategy balances punitive measures with forgiveness, promoting sustained cooperation while deterring exploitation. It adapts dynamically based on collective behavior, ensuring that players can adjust their actions to maintain a healthy resource level.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_364 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone, encouraging others to do the same and maintaining a high stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: If the current stock is below 50% of the capacity, Cooperate to allow replenishment.
   - **Previous Round Analysis**: If the stock is above the threshold, examine the previous round's actions:
     - If more than half of the players Defected in the previous round, choose to Defect this round as a punitive measure.
     - Otherwise, continue to Cooperate.

3. **Last Round Consideration**: Apply the same rules as other rounds. Do not treat the last round differently; base the decision on current stock levels and previous actions to maintain consistency and promote sustainability.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective resource management by reciprocating cooperation and punishing defection, while prioritizing stock conservation when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_365 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual payoffs with maintaining a healthy stock for future rounds, we can adopt a dynamic threshold strategy that adjusts based on both the current stock level and the number of remaining rounds. Here's how you might implement this strategy:

### Dynamic Threshold Strategy Based on Stock Level and Remaining Rounds

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C). This ensures the initial stock remains at its maximum, providing a strong foundation for future rounds.

2. For Subsequent Rounds:
   - Calculate a dynamic threshold \( T \) based on the remaining rounds. Specifically, set \( T = \text{capacity} \times \left(1 - \frac{\text{current\_round}}{r}\right) \).
   - If the current stock level \( S \) is greater than \( T \), choose to Cooperate (C).
   - If \( S \) is less than or equal to \( T \), choose to Defect (D).

This strategy encourages cooperation early on when the threshold is high, ensuring the stock remains robust. As the game progresses and fewer rounds remain, the threshold decreases, allowing for a shift towards defection, which can secure higher individual payoffs in later rounds when there's less future impact.

### Explanation of the Strategy

- **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold \( T \) starts near the maximum capacity early on and gradually decreases as more rounds are played. This reflects the diminishing importance of maintaining a high stock level as the game nears its end.
  
- **Cooperation vs. Defection Decision**: By comparing the current stock level against this moving threshold, players can dynamically adjust their strategy. Cooperation is favored when the stock is healthy and there are many rounds left, while defection becomes more appealing as the stock depletes or fewer rounds remain.

### Example Implementation

Suppose the total number of rounds \( r = 10 \) and capacity = 100.

- **Round 1**: Cooperate (C). Stock remains at 100.
  
- **Round 2**: Calculate \( T = 100 \times (1 - 2/10) = 80 \). If \( S > 80 \), cooperate; else, defect.
  
- **Round 5**: \( T = 100 \times (1 - 5/10) = 50 \). Cooperate if \( S > 50 \); else, defect.

This approach ensures that players adapt their strategies based on both the current state of the stock and the stage of the game, aiming to maximize their payoffs while considering collective outcomes.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_366 = '''
To determine an optimal strategy for cooperation and defection in a repeated game scenario where players can observe all previous actions and outcomes, we need to balance maintaining a healthy stock level with the temptation to defect, especially in the final round. The key considerations are:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to set a high initial stock level.
2. **Stock Level Threshold**: Cooperate as long as the stock after growth remains above 50% of its capacity. This ensures sustainability and regeneration of the stock.
3. **Punishment Mechanism**: If the stock falls below 50%, switch to defecting to protect individual payoffs, as others may also be defecting.
4. **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, always defect since there is no future impact beyond that round.

The strategy is designed to maintain cooperation when beneficial and switch to defection when necessary or inevitable, especially in the last round.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Cooperate unconditionally to establish trust and allow the stock to grow.

2. **Monitoring and Thresholds:**
   - Track the average stock level after each round. Set a threshold at 50% of capacity.
   - If the stock falls below this threshold, infer that defection is occurring and switch to defecting for the next 2 rounds as punishment.

3. **Punishment Phase:**
   - After detecting significant defection (stock below 50%), defect for a set number of rounds (e.g., 2) to penalize defectors.
   - Monitor if cooperation resumes after this period by observing stock recovery.

4. **Return to Cooperation:**
   - If, following the punishment phase, the stock begins to recover (exceeding the threshold), revert to cooperating.
   - Continue monitoring to ensure sustained cooperation and prevent future depletion.

5. **Final Round Handling:**
   - In the last round, if the stock is stable above the threshold, cooperate to maintain fairness and long-term benefits.

**Rationale:**
This strategy balances cooperation with a measured punitive response to defection, encouraging group welfare while deterring exploitation. It ensures that players collectively maintain a sustainable stock level for continued payoffs across all rounds.

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Conservation (ASC)**

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** All players Cooperate (C). This initializes the game with maximum cooperation, ensuring the stock remains at capacity and sets a precedent for future rounds.

- **Subsequent Rounds:** Each player observes the stock level after growth from the previous round (S_prev).

  - If S_prev is below 80% of the capacity, the player Cooperates (C) to help replenish the stock.
  
  - If S_prev is at or above 80% of the capacity, the player Defects (D) to maximize their immediate payoff while ensuring sustainable consumption.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and maintain the stock at its maximum level.
  
- **Last Round:** If the game has a known endpoint, players should Cooperate in the penultimate round to ensure the stock remains healthy for the final round's maximum payoffs.

**3. Rationale:**

- The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by conserving the stock when it's depleted and allowing higher consumption when it's robust.
  
- By using a threshold of 80% capacity, players collectively respond to the stock's health, ensuring that cooperation occurs when necessary without overly restricting payoffs.

   - Continuously monitor the stock level after each round.
   - Calculate the average stock level over the past few rounds (e.g., the last 3 rounds) to smooth out short-term fluctuations.

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - If the average stock level is above a predefined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), continue Cooperating in the next round.
   - If the average stock level falls below this threshold, switch to Defecting for one or more rounds. This action serves as a response to potential overexploitation, aiming to secure individual payoffs and encourage others to return to cooperative behavior.

4. **Recovery Mechanism**:
   - After defecting, monitor whether the stock begins to recover (i.e., reaches or exceeds the threshold again).
   - Once recovery is observed, revert to Cooperating to support the sustainability of the resource.

5. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - In the final rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds) or when the stock level becomes critically low (e.g., below a lower threshold like 25% of capacity), prioritize individual gain by consistently Defecting to maximize personal payoffs before resource depletion.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Establishes a cooperative tone, maximizing collective benefit early on.
- **Stock-Level Monitoring and Thresholds**: Ensures that cooperation continues only when the resource is sustainably managed. Switching to defection when the stock is low prevents further depletion and incentivizes others to cooperate again.
- **Recovery Mechanism**: Allows for flexibility, enabling a return to cooperation once the resource has recovered, thus maintaining long-term sustainability.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Acknowledges that in the final stages, individual optimization becomes necessary as the resource nears depletion.

This strategy balances individual self-interest with collective sustainability, using adaptive mechanisms based on resource levels and past behavior.

description_COLLECTIVE_371 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining the common pool resource while maximizing individual payoffs in a repeated game setting, we propose a threshold-based adaptive strategy. This approach balances cooperation and defection based on the current state of the stock and its trend over time.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round: Cooperate**
   - All players start by cooperating to establish a cooperative baseline and preserve the initial stock level.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1): Adaptive Threshold-Based Cooperation**
   - **Monitor Stock Level:** After each round, observe the current stock level.
   - **Threshold Check:**
     - If the stock is above 50% of the capacity (S > 0.5 * C), continue cooperating.
     - If the stock drops below this threshold (S ≤ 0.5 * C), switch to defecting for subsequent rounds until the stock recovers above the threshold or until the last round.

3. **Last Round (Round r): Defect**
   - In the final round, all players defect to maximize immediate payoffs, as there are no future consequences for resource depletion.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a tone for sustainability and allows the stock to potentially regenerate fully each round.
  
- **Adaptive Threshold:** By using 50% of capacity as a threshold, players can dynamically adjust their behavior. Cooperating while the stock is healthy incentivizes maintenance, while defecting when it's low prevents personal loss if others are exploiting the resource excessively.

- **Last Round Defection:** Recognizing that the last round has no future impact, defecting ensures each player maximizes their final payoff without concern for sustainability.

### Conclusion:

This strategy encourages players to sustain the common pool resource through cooperation while adaptively responding to depletion by switching to defection when necessary. It balances individual and collective interests, aiming to maximize overall payoffs across all rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_372 = '''
To address the problem of whether to cooperate or defect in a common-pool resource game where players can observe the current stock level but not others' strategies, we propose a threshold-based strategy. This approach balances maintaining the stock for future use while allowing players to secure higher payoffs when the stock is at risk.

### Strategy
1. **Cooperation Threshold**: Set a cooperation threshold at 50% of the resource's carrying capacity.
2. **Decision Making**:
   - In each round, if the current stock level exceeds the cooperation threshold, the player chooses to cooperate (C).
   - If the current stock is below or equal to the threshold, the player defects (D).

### Explanation
- **Cooperation When Stock is Healthy**: By cooperating when the stock is above 50% of capacity, players help maintain a sustainable resource level for future rounds.
- **Defection When Stock is Low**: Defecting when the stock falls below the threshold allows players to secure higher immediate payoffs, preventing potential over-depletion and ensuring personal gain.

### Code Logic
```python
cooperation_threshold = 0.5 * capacity

for each round:
    if current_stock > cooperation_threshold:
        choose C (Cooperate)
    else:
        choose D (Defect)
```

This strategy is straightforward, adaptive, and ensures that players act in their own interest while considering the collective resource management.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_373 = '''
The **Adaptive Collective Strategy (ACS)** is designed to balance individual gain with collective sustainability in the Common Pool Resource Game. Here's how it works:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline and maximize collective payoff.

2. **Monitor and Adapt**:
   - After each round, calculate the percentage of players who defected.
   - If defection exceeds 25%, switch to defecting for the next three rounds as a deterrent.

3. **Conserve When Necessary**: Reduce consumption by cooperating more if the stock falls below half of capacity, ensuring resource sustainability.

4. **Last Round Consideration**: Cooperate in the final round to maintain a healthier stock, even if others might defect, fostering a positive end state.

### Key Features:
- **Threshold-Based Response**: Uses a 25% defection threshold to trigger punishment, preventing excessive harm.
- **Gradual Punishment**: Defects for three rounds post-threshold, balancing deterrence without escalating conflict.
- **Sustainability Focus**: Conserves when stock is low, ensuring future payoffs.

### Conclusion:
ACS encourages cooperation while deterring defection, promoting a sustainable collective resource. It adapts to others' behavior, conserves when necessary, and considers endgame dynamics, aligning with a collective mindset for mutual benefit.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_374 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a robust and adaptive collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll employ a responsive approach that balances cooperation with strategic punishment and forgiveness. This strategy leverages the game's public information about stock levels to guide decision-making.

### Strategy: "Responsive Cooperation with Forgiveness"

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and maintain the stock at a high level, encouraging others to do the same.

2. **Monitoring and Decision Rules:**
   - After each round, observe the new stock level \( S_{t+1} \) and calculate the total consumption from the previous round using the formula derived from the stock dynamics.
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If the total consumption in the previous round was ≤ \( S_t / 2 \), continue cooperating. This threshold indicates that players are collectively managing the resource sustainably.
   - **Punishment Trigger:** If the total consumption exceeds \( S_t / 2 \), indicating that some players defected, switch to defecting (D) for the next round as a punitive measure.

3. **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
   - After defecting in response to overconsumption, monitor the stock levels.
   - If the stock level after growth (\( S_{t+1} \)) recovers to at least 80% of capacity, return to cooperating (C). This signals that others may have reverted to cooperative behavior, allowing for resource recovery.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - **Last Round (Round r):** If it's the final round, continue using the same strategy—cooperate if the stock is above the threshold; otherwise, defect. This maintains consistency and prevents endgame exploitation.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If \( S_{t+1} \) drops below 50% of capacity, extend the punishment period by defecting for an additional round to allow more time for recovery.

5. **Adaptive Adjustment:**
   - The strategy remains vigilant by continuously assessing stock levels and adjusting actions accordingly, ensuring responsiveness without being overly punitive.

This approach fosters cooperation while maintaining the flexibility to respond to exploitation, using the shared resource's health as a guide for collective action.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_375 = '''
To address the problem of determining when to cooperate or defect in a repeated game with a common resource (the stock), we can design a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy incorporates thresholds based on the stock level relative to capacity and adjusts behavior based on observed cooperation from other players.

### Strategy Design:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate.
     - Rationale: Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent and maximizes initial resource sustainability.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Threshold Calculation:** Set a threshold at 50% of the capacity (Threshold = 0.5 * Capacity).
   - **Current Stock Evaluation:** Observe the current stock level (S_t) and compare it against the threshold.
     - If S_t > Threshold: Continue cooperating to maintain resource health.
     - If S_t ≤ Threshold: Switch to defecting to secure higher payoffs as others' actions are depleting the stock.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Defect.
     - Rationale: In the final round, there is no future impact, so maximizing immediate payoff is optimal regardless of resource sustainability.

### Explanation:

- **Threshold-Based Cooperation:** By setting a threshold at half the capacity, the strategy ensures that cooperation continues as long as the stock remains sufficiently healthy. This promotes collective sustainability.
  
- **Responsive Defection:** When the stock falls below the threshold, defecting begins to secure higher individual payoffs since others' actions are likely depleting the resource.

- **Last Round Defection:** Acknowledging the endgame scenario, defecting in the last round aligns with individual rationality as there's no future resource to preserve.

### Implementation:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate unconditionally.

2. **Intermediate Rounds Logic:**
   - After each round, assess S_t.
   - Use the threshold to decide whether to cooperate or defect in the subsequent round.

3. **Final Round Decision:**
   - Regardless of stock level, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

This strategy aims to balance cooperation for sustainability with strategic defection when resource depletion indicates insufficient collective cooperation, while also addressing edge cases like the first and last rounds explicitly.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_376 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for each player in this scenario, we'll adopt a threshold-based approach that balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability of the resource. The strategy is as follows:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, all players should cooperate to start with the maximum possible stock level, allowing for future growth.

2. **Stock Level Threshold**: Each player will decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock level relative to the capacity:
   - **Cooperate** if the current stock is below 75% of the capacity.
   - **Defect** if the current stock is at or above 75% of the capacity.

This strategy ensures that when the stock is low, players conserve it by cooperating, allowing for regrowth. When the stock is high enough (at least 75% of capacity), players can safely defect to maximize their immediate payoffs without risking significant depletion that would hinder future growth and payoffs.

**Answer**: The optimal strategy is for each player to cooperate when the current stock is below 75% of its maximum capacity and defect otherwise.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_377 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACWP)**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone.
   - **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
     - **Stock Threshold Check:** After each round, if the stock after growth is above 50% of capacity and at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round, continue to Cooperate (C).
     - **Punishment Mechanism:** If the stock falls below 50% or fewer than half cooperated, switch to Defect (D) for one round as a punitive measure.
   - **Last Round (r):** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future stock to protect.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish trust and maintain a high initial stock level.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is critically low, prioritize individual gain by defecting to secure remaining resources.
   - **Final Round:** Defect to maximize personal payoff without concern for future rounds.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - Encourages cooperation when beneficial and sustainable, ensuring collective well-being through maintained stock levels.
   - Adapts to others' actions by punishing defectors to deter exploitation while allowing recovery of cooperation if conditions improve.

This strategy balances individual rationality with collective sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed outcomes and opponent behavior.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_378 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - All players Cooperate (C). This sets the initial high stock level, promoting future sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** Each player calculates if the current stock is above a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity).
     - If above, cooperate.
     - If below, defect to recover the stock.
   - **Historical Cooperation Rate:** Players assess the number of cooperators in the previous round.
     - High cooperation (>50%) leads to continued cooperation.
     - Low cooperation triggers defection to avoid exploitation.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round (Round r):** Treat like any other round, following the same strategy to maintain consistency and prevent sudden depletion.

This strategy balances individual rationality with collective sustainability by adapting actions based on observable state and history, ensuring robustness against diverse behaviors without requiring communication.

**Strategy Description: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C). All players start by cooperating to establish a high initial stock level and promote cooperation.

2. **Last Round Action**: Defect (D). In the final round, all players defect to maximize their immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

3. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - **High Threshold**: 70% of capacity.
     - If the current stock is above this threshold, cooperate to maintain sustainability.
   - **Medium Threshold**: 50% of capacity.
     - If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to cooperation until it recovers.

4. **Defection and Punishment**:
   - **Punishment Trigger**: If the stock drops into the medium range (between 50-70%), check the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     - If more than half defected, defect in the current round as a punishment.
     - Otherwise, continue cooperating.

5. **Recovery Phase**:
   - When the stock is below 50%, all players cooperate to allow recovery without further depletion.

6. **Hysteresis Mechanism**: Once the stock recovers above the medium threshold after a punishment phase, resume cooperation unless it drops again.

This strategy balances maintaining a sustainable stock level with strategic defection to deter exploitation and maximize payoffs in the final round.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_380 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, I propose the following approach:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy balances cooperation with the need to adapt based on the health of the common pool. It begins cooperatively and adjusts behavior dynamically in response to stock levels, ensuring sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C). This initiates the game by setting a cooperative tone and preserves the stock for future rounds.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   - Monitor the previous round's stock after growth (S').
   - If S' ≥ 50% of capacity, continue to Cooperate.
   - If S' < 50% of capacity, switch to Defect (D) to maximize individual payoffs before potential depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Always Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds, prioritize immediate gain regardless of stock levels.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation helps maintain a high stock level early on, promoting sustainability.
- **Adaptive Threshold:** Using 50% capacity as a threshold ensures that if the stock is still healthy, cooperation continues. If it drops below this point, defecting helps secure higher payoffs before depletion accelerates.
- **Final Round Defection:** In the last round, with no future consequences, maximizing personal gain takes precedence.

### Edge Cases

- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock reaches zero, continued defection is moot as there's nothing left to consume. However, by design, the strategy would have already addressed this risk.
- **High Defection Rates:** The adaptive rule ensures that if many players defect early, the strategy shifts promptly to mitigate losses.

### Conclusion

This approach aligns with a collective mindset by encouraging cooperation while being responsive to changes in the common pool's health. It balances long-term sustainability with individual gain, adapting dynamically without relying on others' strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_381 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game while balancing reciprocity and resource conservation, we can outline a structured strategy. This approach ensures that players act cooperatively unless certain conditions indicating potential exploitation or resource depletion are met.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C). This initiates the interaction positively, encouraging mutual cooperation from the start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   For each round after the first:
   
   a. **Count Previous Defectors:** Determine how many players defected in the previous round (D_count).
   
   b. **Check Conditions for Defection:**
      - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round (i.e., D_count > n/2), choose to defect.
      - Additionally, if the current stock level is below a recovery threshold (e.g., capacity divided by 4), defect to protect the resource.

   c. **Default Action:** If neither condition for defection is met, cooperate (C).

3. **Last Round Consideration:**
   While there's an temptation to defect in the final round due to no future consequences, maintaining consistency with the strategy helps prevent unraveling of cooperation in earlier rounds. Thus, follow the same rules without special casing the last round.

### Summary:

- **Cooperate** unless significant previous defection or low resource levels justify a switch to **defection**.
- This strategy promotes cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation and resource depletion.

### Algorithmic Implementation Steps:

1. Initialize action in the first round as Cooperate (C).
2. For each subsequent round:
   - Retrieve the number of defectors from the previous round.
   - Check if this count exceeds half the total players or if the current stock is below a set recovery threshold.
   - Choose Defect if either condition is met; otherwise, choose Cooperate.

This balanced approach ensures sustainable interaction while maintaining reciprocity.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_382 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maintain stock sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs. This strategy is based on observable state variables and past actions, ensuring robustness against diverse opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first round, all players cooperate to maximize initial payoff without depleting the stock. This sets a cooperative tone and allows the stock to remain at capacity.

2. **Stock Threshold Monitoring**:
   - Players continuously monitor the current stock level relative to the game's capacity.
   - A threshold is set at 50% of the capacity. If the stock remains above this threshold, players continue to cooperate (C). This encourages sustainable use and maintains higher future payoffs.

3. **Defection Trigger**:
   - If the stock drops below the 50% threshold, players switch to defecting (D) for the subsequent rounds. Defecting in these situations serves dual purposes: it signals dissatisfaction with overexploitation and allows individuals to secure higher immediate payoffs when the stock is depleted.

4. **Recovery and Re-cooperation**:
   - Once the stock recovers above the 50% threshold through natural growth or reduced consumption, players revert to cooperation. This phase aims to replenish the stock for future sustainability.

5. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - In the final round of the game (round r), all players defect. Since there are no subsequent rounds to consider, defecting maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

6. **Punishment Mechanism**:
   - If a significant number of players defect in previous rounds (e.g., more than 50%), players may choose to defect temporarily as a form of punishment or retaliation, even if the stock is above the threshold. This deters excessive defection and maintains cooperation incentives.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round**: Always cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
- **Last Round (r)**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff without future repercussions.
- **Near Depletion**: If the stock approaches zero, players prioritize immediate gain by defecting, as future rounds offer minimal benefits.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def strategy(player_id, current_stock, capacity, n, r, history):
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity  # 50% of capacity
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == r:
        return "D"
    
    if current_stock > threshold:
        cooperation_count = sum(1 for actions in history[-n:] for action in actions if action == 'C')
        if cooperation_count / n >= 0.5:  # At least 50% cooperated last round
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
    else:
        return "D"

def main():
    # Example usage
    history = []  # Initialize history
    for t in range(r):
        actions = []
        for i in range(n):
            action = strategy(i, current_stock, capacity, n, r, history)
            actions.append(action)
        # Update history and stock accordingly

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Threshold Cooperation**: By setting a threshold at 50% of the game's capacity, players are incentivized to cooperate when the stock is plentiful and defect when it becomes scarce.
- **Recovery Mechanism**: Allowing the stock to recover after dropping below the threshold ensures future rounds can sustain cooperation without depletion.
- **Endgame Defection**: Recognizing that the last round offers no future benefits, all players maximize their payoff by defecting.

This strategy encourages sustainable use of the common resource while providing mechanisms to deter excessive defection and adapt to changing stock levels. It balances individual self-interest with collective sustainability, making it robust against various opponent strategies in a tournament setting.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_383 = '''
To maintain the sustainability of the resource and encourage cooperation among all participants, each player should adopt the following strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, every player will Cooperate by choosing action C.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - After each round, calculate the total consumption from the previous round.
   - If the previous round's total consumption exceeds half of the stock before that round's actions (i.e., if total consumption > Sₜ/₂), then in the current round, Defect by choosing action D.
   - Otherwise, continue to Cooperate by choosing action C.

This strategy ensures that players act to maintain resource sustainability. If the resource was overused in the previous round, indicating potential cooperation breakdown, each player defects once as a punitive measure. This encourages others to return to cooperative behavior to prevent further depletion of the stock.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_384 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Cooperation (ACC)**

The ACC strategy is designed to balance individual gain with collective sustainability in the Common Pool Resource game. It uses past behavior and current stock levels to guide decisions, promoting cooperation while deterring excessive defection.

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - **Cooperate** if fewer than 30% of players defected in the previous round and the stock is above 50% of capacity.
  - **Defect** if at least 30% defected or the stock is below 50%, to retaliate or conserve resources.
- **Last Round:** Cooperate if the average cooperation rate was high; otherwise, defect.

### 2. Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to build trust.
- **Last Round:** Adjust based on historical cooperation to balance short-term gain with long-term sustainability.

### 3. Collective Alignment:
The strategy encourages cooperation by rewarding past cooperative behavior and punishing defection moderately, aiming to maintain a healthy stock level for future rounds.

This approach is adaptive, responding to both the actions of others and the state of the resource, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors while promoting collective well-being.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_385 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Sustainability**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to maximize initial stock preservation and set a cooperative tone.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - If it's not the last round, check the current stock level.
    - **Stock below 50% of capacity:** Cooperate to allow growth and maintain sustainability.
    - **Stock above 50% of capacity:** Defect to increase immediate payoff while ensuring stock remains healthy.
- **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize personal gain without concern for future rounds.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to establish a high initial stock level, promoting long-term sustainability.
- **Stock Near Capacity:** If the stock is at or near capacity, consider defecting in non-last rounds if it aligns with maintaining a balance that allows growth without depletion.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
- Encourages players to act in ways that sustain the common pool for future rounds while balancing individual gains.
- Uses stock level as a collective signal to guide actions, ensuring everyone contributes to resource management without explicit communication.

This strategy balances immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability, adapting based on stock levels and game progression.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_386 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability in a common-pool resource scenario, we can implement a threshold-based cooperation strategy. This approach ensures that individuals maximize their gains while preserving the resource for future use.

### Strategy:

1. **Define a Threshold**: Set a threshold at half of the resource's capacity (T = Capacity / 2).

2. **Decision Rule**:
   - If the current stock (S) is below or equal to T, **cooperate** by consuming only your sustainable share.
   - If S is above T, **defect** to maximize your immediate payoff.

3. **Implementation**:
   - In each round, observe the current stock level.
   - Cooperate when S ≤ T to help replenish the resource.
   - Defect when S > T to capitalize on the abundant resource.

4. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose Capacity = 100 units and n = 4 players.
   - Threshold T = 50 units.
     - If S ≤ 50, each player consumes 12.5 units (cooperate).
     - If S > 50, each player consumes 25 units (defect).

### Explanation:

- **Sustainability**: When the stock is low, cooperation ensures that the resource isn't overexploited, allowing it to regenerate.
- **Maximization**: When the stock is plentiful, defecting allows individuals to capture more value without risking immediate depletion.

This strategy encourages collective action by aligning individual incentives with the group's long-term interests, preventing the tragedy of the commons while optimizing payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_387 = '''
To ensure sustainable consumption while maintaining incentives for cooperation, the optimal strategy is:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each round, check if the new stock level falls below 90% of the capacity.
3. **Punish Defection**: If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting for one round as a punishment.
4. **Forgive and Resume Cooperation**: After defecting once, return to Cooperating if the stock recovers above the 90% threshold.

This approach balances punishment with forgiveness, encouraging cooperation while maintaining sustainable stock levels for future rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_388 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Stock Threshold Cooperation (ASTC)**

1. **Decision Rule**: Each player cooperates if the current stock level is above 50% of the capacity; otherwise, they defect.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: All players cooperate to initialize a healthy stock.
   - **Last Round**: Players may choose to defect as there are no future rounds, but following ASTC ensures consistency.

3. **Collective Alignment**: The strategy is designed for all players to follow the same rule, promoting mutual cooperation when the resource is plentiful and conserving it for sustained payoffs across all rounds.

**Pseudocode Example**:
```
def decide_action(stock, capacity):
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    if stock > threshold:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

# In each round
action = decide_action(current_stock, game_capacity)
take_action(action)
update_payoff()
```

This strategy balances individual gain with collective resource management, ensuring the stock remains sustainable and maximizing long-term payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_389 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable balance between individual gain and collective resource management in a repeated game setting, we propose the following strategy:

**Cooperative Threshold Strategy**

1. **Threshold Definition**: Each player sets a stock level threshold at 75% of the total capacity (C). This serves as the benchmark for deciding whether to cooperate or defect.

2. **Decision Rule**:
   - If the current stock level (S) is below 75% of C, the player will choose to Cooperate (C). This action helps in conserving the resource and allowing it to recover.
   - If the current stock level (S) is at or above 75% of C, the player will choose to Defect (D). Defecting when the stock is plentiful allows the player to maximize their immediate payoff while the resource can sustain the higher consumption.

3. **Rationale**:
   - When the stock is low, cooperation is essential to prevent depletion and ensure future payoffs.
   - When the stock is high, defecting allows players to capitalize on the abundance without causing immediate harm, as the resource's regrowth can sustain the increased consumption.

This strategy encourages sustainable use by prompting cooperation when resources are scarce and allowing for strategic defection when resources are plentiful. It aims to balance individual incentives with collective well-being, promoting a stable equilibrium in the long run.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_390 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Conservation with Punishment (ACP)**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, Cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and observe other players' behavior.

2. **Punishment Mechanism**: For each subsequent round, if more than half of the players defected in the previous round, switch to Defecting for the current round as a form of punishment to deter excessive exploitation.

3. **Stock Conservation**: If the stock level after the previous round's consumption is below half of the capacity, Cooperate to help replenish and conserve the stock for future rounds.

4. **Final Round Maximization**: In the last round, always choose to Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels since the game concludes after this round.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, promoting sustainability while being robust against exploitation. It adapts based on both the actions of other players and the current state of the common pool resource.

**Pseudocode:**

```
def strategy(n, capacity, r, history):
    if len(history) == 0:
        return "C"
    
    t = len(history) + 1
    previous_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    D_prev = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
    S_prev = history[-1]['stock_after']

    if t == r:
        return "D"
    elif D_prev > n / 2:
        return "D"
    elif S_prev < capacity / 2:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "C"
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts with Cooperate to encourage mutual cooperation.
- **Punishment for Excessive Defection**: If a majority of players defected in the previous round, the strategy switches to Defect to punish and deter future exploitation.
- **Stock Conservation**: When the stock is below half capacity, Cooperate to allow regrowth and ensure sustainability.
- **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, the strategy defects to maximize immediate gain since there are no future consequences.

This approach ensures that the player acts in their self-interest while contributing to the conservation of the common resource when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_391 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - Begin with cooperation in the first few rounds to establish a cooperative norm and observe others' behavior.

2. **Adaptive Cooperation Threshold:**
   - Monitor the stock level relative to capacity. If stock drops below 50% of capacity, switch to cooperation to encourage replenishment.
   - Calculate the average number of defectors over the past three rounds. If more than half defected, defect in the next round as a punishment.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - If the previous round's stock drops significantly (e.g., below 30% capacity), defect for one round to deter future defection.
   - After punishing, return to cooperation if the stock begins to recover.

4. **Stock Replenishment Priority:**
   - Cooperate when the stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) to allow growth and prevent depletion.

5. **Final Round Consideration:**
   - In the last round, if the stock is high enough that defecting won't cause significant harm, consider defecting to maximize payoff.
   - Otherwise, continue cooperating to preserve the resource for potential future interactions beyond the current game.

This strategy balances cooperation and strategic defection, adapting based on past behavior and current stock levels to maintain sustainability while deterring excessive exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_392 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for a game where players must decide each round whether to cooperate or defect, considering both immediate gains and future consequences, we can outline a structured approach based on the thought process above. The goal is to maximize individual payoff while maintaining a sustainable stock level until the endgame.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a high initial stock level.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels:** For subsequent rounds, monitor the stock level after each round. If it remains above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), continue cooperating.
3. **Defect When Necessary:** If the stock level drops below the threshold in previous rounds, defect to either protect your payoff or respond to others' potential defection.
4. **Endgame Defection:** In the final round, defect to maximize immediate gain without concern for future stock levels.

### Detailed Strategy

1. **First Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to set a high initial stock level.
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - After each round, check if the stock level after consumption and growth is above or below a sustainable threshold (e.g., capacity/2).
   - If the stock is above the threshold, continue cooperating in the next round.
   - If the stock drops below the threshold, defect in the next round to adapt to potential defection by others.
3. **Last Round (Round r):** Defect to maximize your payoff since there are no future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def strategy(current_round, total_rounds, capacity, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "COOPERATE"
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return "DEFECT"
    else:
        # Calculate the threshold (e.g., half of capacity)
        threshold = capacity / 2
        # Get the stock level after the previous round
        previous_stock = history[-1].new_stock
        if previous_stock > threshold:
            return "COOPERATE"
        else:
            return "DEFECT"
```

### Explanation

- **First Round:** By cooperating, we start with a high stock level, which benefits everyone.
- **Middle Rounds:** We monitor the stock level. If it remains healthy (above 50% of capacity), cooperation continues. If it drops, indicating possible defection by others, we defect to protect our interests.
- **Last Round:** Defecting in the final round allows us to take as much as possible without worrying about future consequences.

This strategy balances cooperation to maintain a sustainable stock level with strategic defection when necessary and in the endgame.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_393 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone to maximize stock sustainability and future payoffs.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   a. **Monitor Previous Defections:** Count the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   b. **Stock Health Check:** Evaluate if the current stock level is below 50% of capacity.
   c. **Decision Rules:**
      - If the stock is below 50% capacity, choose to Cooperate (C) to help replenish the stock.
      - If more than 30% of players defected in the previous round and the stock is above 50%, Defect (D) to protect your payoff.
      - Otherwise, continue to Cooperate (C).

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Always Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds, maximize immediate payoff without concern for stock depletion.

This strategy aims to balance cooperation and self-interest, adapting based on both the health of the resource and the behavior of other players, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies while maximizing long-term payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_394 = '''
To address the challenge of sustaining the common pool resource while adapting to other players' behaviors, we propose a collective strategy that combines cooperation with adaptive responses based on the game's state and history.

### Strategy: Adaptive Sustainability with Reciprocal Cooperation (ASRC)

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round (t=1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a pattern of mutual benefit and maintain a high stock level from the beginning.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:**
     - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, cooperate.
     - If the stock is 50% or below, defect to maximize immediate gain while considering potential depletion.
   - **Reciprocal Response:**
     - Track the number of defectors in previous rounds. If the average number of defectors exceeds a threshold (e.g., more than half the players), switch to defection in subsequent rounds to avoid being exploited.

3. **Last Round (t=r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** In the final round, with no future repercussions, prioritize immediate payoff by defecting, as cooperation here doesn't yield future benefits.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Very Low Stock:** If the stock after consumption in any round drops to zero or near-zero, defect in subsequent rounds to prevent further depletion and maximize personal gain from the remaining resource.
  
- **High Cooperation Scenario:** If a significant majority of players consistently cooperate (e.g., above 75%), continue cooperating to sustain the resource and maintain high payoffs.

**Adaptive Mechanism:**

- **Stock Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the stock level relative to capacity. Adjust cooperative behavior to conserve the stock when it's plentiful, ensuring future rounds have sufficient resources.
  
- **Behavior Adaptation:** Use past actions of other players to inform current decisions. If others are defecting frequently, shift towards defection to protect one's own payoffs.

**Collective Mindset:**

The ASRC strategy aligns with a collective mindset by initially promoting cooperation to sustain the resource for mutual benefit. It adapts to prevent exploitation while considering the necessity of self-interest when the stock is under threat. By reciprocating others' behavior and responding to the stock's health, it balances individual payoff maximization with the preservation of the common pool.

This strategy is robust against a range of opponent behaviors, ensuring sustainability where possible while protecting against over-exploitation by defectors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_395 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial resource conservation.

2. **Adaptive Cooperation Based on History:**
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate from all players over the previous rounds.
     - If the average cooperation rate is above 50%, continue cooperating.
     - If below, defect for the next round as a punitive measure to encourage others to cooperate.

3. **Stock-Level Conservation:**
   - Monitor the stock level after each round.
     - If the stock falls below half of the capacity (capacity/2), switch to cooperation for the next two rounds to allow regrowth, regardless of others' actions.

4. **Punishment and Forgiveness:**
   - Implement a limited punishment period where if a player defects, you defect for one round.
     - After punishing, revert to cooperation to test if others return to cooperative behavior.

5. **Final Rounds Consideration:**
   - In the last round, cooperate if the stock is above capacity/2 to ensure sustainability beyond the game's end.

**Decision Rules Pseudocode:**

```
function decide_action(current_round, stock_level, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        avg_coop = average_cooperation(history)
        if stock_level < capacity / 2:
            return Cooperate for next two rounds
        elif avg_coop >= 0.5:
            return Cooperate
        else:
            return Defect for one round
```

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection to maintain resource sustainability, adapting based on collective behavior and stock health. It encourages cooperation while deterring excessive defection through limited punishment, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_396 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold and Endgame Considerations**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a norm of cooperation and preserve the stock.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - **Cooperate (C)** if the current stock is above 50% of capacity AND at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round.
     - **Defect (D)** if the stock falls below 50% or fewer than half cooperated previously.
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as future rounds don't exist.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **Low Stock Scenario (<10% of capacity):** Regardless of other factors, Defect to secure any remaining resources.
   - **Endgame Strategy:** In the last two rounds, prioritize defecting to capture maximum payoffs without concern for stock replenishment.

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   The strategy encourages initial cooperation to sustain the resource, adapting based on both stock levels and others' actions. It rewards continued cooperation when beneficial but allows strategic defection to prevent being exploited or when the stock is critically low.

**Pseudocode Explanation:**

```
function decide_action(round, stock, capacity, history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Calculate the number of players who cooperated last round
        previous_cooperations = count('C' in history[round-1])
        cooperation_rate = previous_cooperations / n
        
        if stock > 0.5 * capacity and cooperation_rate >= 0.5:
            return 'C'
        elif round == r or stock < 0.1 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Consider number of rounds remaining to decide
            # If in last few rounds, defect; otherwise, adapt based on stock and history
            if round > r - 2:
                return 'D'
            else:
                if cooperation_rate < 0.5 or stock <= 0.5 * capacity:
                    return 'D'
                else:
                    return 'C'
```

This strategy balances cooperation to sustain the common pool with strategic defection when necessary, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors while aiming for optimal collective payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_397 = '''
To maximize individual payoffs while considering the sustainability of the common resource, each player should adopt a threshold-based strategy. Here's how it works:

1. **Cooperate when the stock is above 50% of capacity**: This ensures the resource remains plentiful for future rounds.
2. **Defect once the stock drops below 50%**: Prioritize immediate gains since the resource can no longer sustain long-term cooperation.

**Final Answer:**

Each player should cooperate as long as the current stock exceeds half of its maximum capacity and defect otherwise. Therefore, the strategy is:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock > 0.5 \times \text{capacity; Defect otherwise}}}$
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_398 = '''
The collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation and self-interest, adapting based on the game state and others' actions. Here's how it works:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Coopetition

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Builds trust and maintains a healthy stock level, encouraging reciprocal cooperation.

2. **Conservation Phase (When Stock Falls Below 30% of Capacity):**
   - **Decision Rule:** Cooperate if most players cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Encourages stock replenishment while protecting against exploitation by others' defection.

3. **Exploitation Phase (When Stock Exceeds 70% of Capacity):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximizes immediate payoff by taking advantage of a plentiful resource without significant risk of depletion.

4. **Final Round Strategy:**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Prioritizes immediate gain as future consequences are irrelevant, aligning with the game's last-round dynamics.

### Key Considerations

- **Adaptability:** The strategy adjusts based on stock levels and past actions, ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions.
- **Robustness:** Handles diverse opponent behaviors by monitoring cooperation rates and adapting accordingly.
- **Edge Cases Management:** Clear rules for initial and final rounds ensure strategic consistency throughout the game.

This approach aims to sustain resource availability while optimizing individual payoffs, making it robust against various strategies in a tournament setting.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_399 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to establish trust and maintain resource sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   a. **Reciprocation Rule:**
      - Calculate the average cooperation rate of all players from the previous round(s). If more than half cooperated, cooperate in the current round.
      - If less than or equal to half cooperated, defect.

   b. **Stock Level Consideration:**
      - Monitor the current stock level after consumption and growth.
      - Cooperate if the stock is above 50% of capacity; otherwise, defect to secure resources before depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate if the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity); otherwise, defect.
   - **Rationale:** Balance between ending on a cooperative note to leave a sustainable resource and securing final payoffs if the stock is low.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If the stock is critically low (e.g., below 20% of capacity), prioritize cooperation to allow regrowth, unless others are defecting.
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on game parameters like n and capacity to maintain flexibility.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - As the game progresses towards later rounds, gradually decrease the cooperation threshold to allow more defection, balancing immediate gains with future sustainability.

This strategy combines reciprocation of past actions with stock-level monitoring to adapt to various opponent behaviors while maintaining resource sustainability. It starts cooperatively, adapts based on others' actions and stock health, and adjusts near the end to balance final payoffs with sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_400 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a robust collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we developed an approach that balances cooperation and defection based on historical actions and the current state of the stock. The strategy aims to maintain a healthy stock level while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round:**
   - All players cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial stock sustainability.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round and the stock after growth was above 75% of capacity, continue cooperating.
   - **Defection Trigger:** If fewer than half cooperated or the stock is below the threshold, defect to either punish non-cooperative behavior or conserve the stock.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Defect if the current stock level allows for a higher immediate payoff without future consequences, as there are no subsequent rounds to affect.

This strategy encourages sustained cooperation while allowing for adaptive responses to exploitation, ensuring the stock remains viable across all rounds.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def collective_strategy(n, capacity, r, history):
    if len(history) == 0:
        # First round: Cooperate
        return 'C'
    
    t = len(history) + 1
    if t > r:
        # Beyond last round
        return None
    
    c_prev = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'C')
    S_prev_after_growth = history[-1]['stock_after']
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity  # Adjust based on desired conservatism
    
    if t == r:
        # Last round: Defect to maximize immediate payoff
        return 'D'
    
    if c_prev >= n / 2 and S_prev_after_growth >= threshold:
        # Enough cooperated last round and stock is healthy; cooperate
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Not enough cooperation or stock too low; defect
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **First Round:** Everyone starts by cooperating to ensure the stock remains high.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** Players check if enough people cooperated previously and if the stock is healthy. If both conditions are met, they continue cooperating; otherwise, they defect.
- **Last Round:** Since there's no future impact, players prioritize immediate payoff by defecting.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, fostering cooperation while allowing for necessary adjustments to maintain stock health over multiple rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_401 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for players in a common-pool resource game where each player can choose to Cooperate or Defect, we need a rule that balances sustainability with self-interest. The goal is to maximize individual payoff while ensuring the resource isn't depleted.

**Strategy:**

1. **First Round:** All players should Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** In each round, calculate the total consumption from the previous round:
   - If total consumption exceeded half of the stock in that round, all players should Defect.
   - Otherwise, continue to Cooperate.

**Explanation:**

- **Cooperation in Early Stages:** By starting with cooperation, players ensure that the resource is used sustainably, maintaining or increasing its availability for future rounds.
  
- **Punishing Overconsumption:** If at any point the total consumption exceeds half of the stock, it indicates that some players are overusing the resource. To prevent further depletion and unfair advantage, all players switch to Defecting, which, while leading to immediate resource depletion, ensures that no single player benefits disproportionately.

**Example Walkthrough:**

- **Round 1:** All Cooperate.
  - Each consumes 12.5 units (if stock is 100).
  - Total consumption = 50, leaving 50, which grows back to 100.
  
- **Round 2:** Suppose one Defects, three Cooperate.
  - Consumption: 3*12.5 + 1*25 = 62.5.
  - Stock drops to 37.5, grows to 84.375.
  
- **Round 3:** Since total consumption (62.5) > 50, all Defect.
  - Each consumes ~21.09 units.
  - Total consumption depletes the stock to 0.

This strategy balances individual payoff with collective sustainability but leads to depletion once overconsumption occurs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_402 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual payoff maximization with maintaining a sustainable stock level over multiple rounds, we can implement an adaptive strategy that responds to the current state of the stock and past actions. Here's how the strategy is structured:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate. This sets a baseline for sustainability.
2. **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1)**:
   - If the current stock level is below half of its capacity, Cooperate to allow recovery.
   - If the previous round's total consumption exceeded the cooperative benchmark (i.e., more than half the stock was consumed), Defect in the current round.
   - Otherwise, continue Cooperating.
3. **Last Round (r)**: Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

### Explanation:
- **First Round Cooperation**: Ensures initial sustainability and sets a cooperative tone.
- **Stock Level Check**: If the stock is low, cooperation helps in recovery, ensuring future rounds have sufficient resources.
- **Past Consumption Assessment**: By checking if previous consumption was excessive, players adapt by defecting to increase their share when others have been over-consuming.
- **Last Round Defection**: Maximizes individual gain in the final round since there are no subsequent rounds to affect.

This strategy balances cooperation and defection based on stock levels and past behavior, promoting sustainability while allowing for strategic defection when beneficial.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_403 = '''
**Adaptive Cooperation Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to establish trust and maximize initial stock growth.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     - If the cooperation rate in the previous round was above 70%, continue to Cooperate.
     - If the cooperation rate was below 70%, Defect for one round as a punishment.
     - After defecting once, return to Cooperation if enough players cooperated in the subsequent rounds.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: All players cooperate to set a positive precedent.
   - **Last Round**: Cooperate if previous rounds had high cooperation; otherwise, consider defecting based on observed behavior.
   - If the stock falls below half of capacity, switch to Cooperation to help replenish it.

3. **Collective Mindset**:
   - Encourage cooperation when possible and apply limited punishment for defection to maintain sustainability without leading to mutual defection cycles.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by rewarding cooperation, applying measured punishment, and adapting based on the stock's health.

description_COLLECTIVE_404 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

**Objective:**  
To maximize individual payoffs while maintaining the sustainability of the common pool resource over multiple rounds by balancing cooperation and strategic punishment of defectors.

### 1. Decision Rules:

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish an initial cooperative norm.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - Calculate the average cooperation rate among all players in the previous round.
    - Cooperation Rate = Number of Cooperators / Total Players
  - Monitor the stock level trend:
    - If the stock is increasing or stable, continue cooperating.
    - If the stock is decreasing, switch to Defect (D) for a set number of rounds (e.g., 2-3 rounds) as a punitive measure.
  - Always Defect in the final round.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to encourage others to follow suit.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future stock to protect.
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), defect until the stock begins to recover.

### 3. Collective Alignment:

- The strategy is designed to encourage cooperation when beneficial and to punish defection to maintain resource sustainability, aligning individual actions with collective interests.

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_punishment(current_round, total_rounds, stock_history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate average cooperation rate from previous round
    prev_actions = get_previous_actions()
    avg_coop_rate = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'C') / len(prev_actions)
    
    # Determine stock trend based on history
    stock_trend = calculate_stock_trend(stock_history)
    
    if current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"  # Defect in the last round
    
    if stock_trend == "decreasing":
        # Implement punishment phase for a set number of rounds
        if current_round - last_coop_round <= punishment_rounds:
            return "D"
    
    return "C"

# Example parameters
punishment_rounds = 3  # Number of rounds to defect as punishment
```

### Summary:

This strategy begins cooperatively, adapts based on others' actions and stock health, punishes defectors to maintain resource sustainability, and optimizes for the final round. It balances individual gain with collective resource management, aiming to sustain the common pool for long-term benefits while being robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_405 = '''
To maintain sustainable consumption and prevent depletion of the resource, players should follow a strategy that adjusts their behavior based on the current stock level relative to its capacity. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Threshold Identification**: Define a threshold at half of the resource's capacity (e.g., 50% of maximum capacity).

2. **Action Based on Stock Level**:
   - If the current stock is below this threshold, choose to Cooperate to reduce consumption and allow the stock to recover.
   - If the current stock is above or equal to the threshold, Defect to maximize immediate payoff without risking significant depletion.

This strategy ensures that when resources are plentiful, players can take advantage by defecting for higher gains. When resources are scarce, cooperation helps conserve and rebuild the stock. This balance aims to maintain a healthy resource level over time while considering both individual and collective benefits.

**Final Answer**: Players should cooperate if the current stock is below half of its capacity; otherwise, they should defect. This strategy promotes sustainability by conserving resources when necessary and allowing for higher consumption when plentiful. The final answer is encapsulated as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if stock is below 50\% of capacity; otherwise Defect}}

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Reciprocity with Stock Conservation (ARSC)

**Objective:** To sustainably manage the common pool resource by encouraging cooperation while protecting against exploitation through adaptive reciprocity.

---

### **1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**

- **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative precedent.
  
- **Monitor Past Actions**: Track the cooperation rate (percentage of players who cooperated) in each previous round and maintain a moving average over the past few rounds.

- **Reciprocity Mechanism**:
  - If the cooperation rate is above 80%, continue cooperating.
  - If it drops between 60% and 80%, cooperate but monitor closely. If it doesn't improve, prepare to defect.
  - Below 60%, defect for one or two rounds as a form of punishment.

- **Stock Level Consideration**:
  - Always cooperate if the stock is below a threshold (e.g., 30%) to allow regeneration.
  - If the stock is healthy (>50%), continue cooperating if others do so, otherwise defect strategically.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round**: Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
  
- **Last Round**: 
  - If stock is sufficient (e.g., >70% of capacity), cooperate to maintain sustainability.
  - If stock is low, continue cooperating to prevent depletion; defect only if it maximizes personal gain without causing a crash.

- **Stock Depletion**: If stock falls below 30%, switch to full cooperation to rebuild the resource.

---

### **3. Collective Alignment**

The strategy aligns with a collective mindset by encouraging mutual cooperation and sustainable resource use. Players adapt their actions based on group behavior, rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, while prioritizing resource conservation when necessary.

### **Conclusion**

The ARSC strategy balances individual and collective interests by reciprocating cooperation, punishing defection, and conserving the resource when necessary. It adapts to both the stock level and others' behavior, ensuring sustainability while being robust against various opponent strategies.

To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for resource extraction across multiple rounds, we have developed a balanced approach that considers both cooperation and retaliation while prioritizing regeneration when necessary. The strategy is designed to be simple yet robust, ensuring sustainability while allowing for maximum payoff in the final round.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish trust and maximize collective gain.
   
2. **Adaptive Response**:
   - For each subsequent round except the last, check two conditions:
     1. **Stock Level**: If the current stock is below half of the capacity (50%), switch to cooperation to allow regeneration for future rounds.
     2. **Retaliation Threshold**: If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, retaliate by defecting in the current round to discourage excessive exploitation.
   - If neither condition is met, continue cooperating.

3. **Final Round Maximization**: In the last round, always defect to secure the highest possible immediate payoff, as there are no future rounds to consider.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Round 1**: Cooperate. All players take a smaller share (S/(2n)) but ensure the resource remains plentiful for future rounds.
   
2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - **Stock Check**: If the current stock level (S) is below half of the capacity, cooperate to regenerate the resource.
     - This ensures that the resource doesn't deplete prematurely, allowing for sustained use in subsequent rounds.
   - **Defection Retaliation**: If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect in the current round. This punishes excessive exploitation and encourages cooperation.
   - **Default Cooperation**: If neither condition is met, continue cooperating to maintain a high stock level for maximum collective benefit.

3. **Round r (Last Round)**: Always defect. In the final round, each player maximizes their immediate payoff by taking a larger share (S/n), as there are no future consequences beyond this round.

### Benefits of This Strategy:

- **Sustainability**: Prioritizing cooperation unless retaliation is necessary or regeneration is required helps maintain a healthy stock level for as long as possible.
  
- **Fairness and Retaliation**: By retaliating against excessive defection, the strategy discourages players from exploiting the resource greedily, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.

- **Maximization in Final Round**: Allowing players to defect in the last round ensures they can maximize their personal gain without concern for future depletion, aligning with individual rationality.

This approach balances immediate self-interest with long-term sustainability, providing a practical solution that can be adopted collectively to optimize outcomes across all rounds.

description_COLLECTIVE_408 = '''
To address the problem of deciding between cooperation (C) and defection (D) in a repeated game where each player's payoff depends on their own choice and the choices of others, we can implement a strategy based on a threshold stock level. This approach ensures that players act uniformly based on observable, common information to maintain a sustainable resource.

### Strategy:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If the current stock after regeneration is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), choose to Cooperate in the next round.
   - If it's below this threshold, Defect in the next round.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by maintaining cooperation when the resource is healthy and defecting only when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_409 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable stock level while maximizing individual payoffs in a dynamic environment, we propose a balanced strategy that incorporates both reciprocity and environmental considerations. This approach ensures that players cooperate to allow stock regrowth when necessary and punish excessive defection to maintain fairness.

### Strategy:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C).

2. For each subsequent round t:
   - Let S_{t-1} be the stock level after consumption in round t-1.
   - If S_{t-1} < 0.5 * Capacity:
     - Choose to Cooperate (C) this round to allow regrowth.
   - Else:
     - Count the number of players who defected in round t-1 (k).
     - If k > n/2:
       - Choose to Defect (D) this round as punishment.
     - Else:
       - Choose to Cooperate (C).

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and allows the stock to grow initially without depletion.
  
- **Stock Level Check:** If the stock after consumption in the previous round drops below 50% of capacity, all players switch to cooperating. This collective effort ensures that the stock can recover, preventing long-term depletion.
  
- **Punishment Mechanism:** When the stock is sufficient but more than half of the players defected last round, the strategy shifts to defection. This acts as a deterrent against excessive exploitation and maintains fairness among players.

This strategy effectively balances individual incentives with collective sustainability, encouraging cooperation while penalizing unfair behavior.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_410 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for each player in managing the shared resource (stock), we've considered various approaches and game-theoretic principles. The chosen strategy balances cooperation with self-interest, ensuring sustainability while maximizing individual gains.

**Strategy:**
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and resource management.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - After each round, assess the stock level after growth (S_{t-1}).
   - If S_{t-1} is at least half of the total capacity, continue cooperating.
   - If S_{t-1} drops below this threshold, defect in the next round to secure personal gains while signaling the need for others to conserve.

**Rationale:**
- Cooperation is maintained as long as the stock remains above a critical level, preventing depletion.
- Defection occurs when the stock is low, allowing players to maximize immediate payoffs while prompting others to reassess their strategies.

This approach aims to sustain the resource while providing individual incentives to adapt behavior based on collective outcomes.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_411 = '''
**Collective Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a high initial stock level.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     1. If the current stock is above 90% of capacity, Cooperate (C).
     2. If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, Defect (D) to conserve resources or signal dissatisfaction.
     3. In between these thresholds, check the number of cooperators in the previous round:
        - Cooperate if more than half of the players cooperated last round.
        - Defect otherwise.
   - **Last Round:** Continue with the same strategy to maintain stock health.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Default to cooperation to build a strong foundation.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Defect when stock is critically low to prevent over-depletion and signal the need for conservation.
   - **High Stock Levels:** Cooperate to sustainably manage resources, allowing regeneration.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy relies on observable game state and history, ensuring each player's decision aligns with collective goals without communication.
   - Players use past cooperation rates and current stock levels as public signals to guide their actions.

4. **Adaptive Mechanism:**
   - Thresholds (e.g., 90%, 50%) are relative to the capacity and number of players, allowing adaptability across different game configurations.
   - Forgiveness is implicit by reevaluating cooperation based on current stock and recent behavior, encouraging sustained cooperation.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, promoting collective well-being through adaptive decision-making.

description_COLLECTIVE_412 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT)**

The ACT strategy is designed to balance collective cooperation with individual self-interest in a dynamic, repeated game setting. It aims to sustain the common pool resource by encouraging cooperation when beneficial and switching to defection as the stock depletes.

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Cooperate.
- **Middle Rounds**: 
  - If current stock > capacity / 2: Cooperate.
  - Else: Defect.
- **Last Round**: Always defect.

### 2. Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round**: All players cooperate to maximize initial stock growth.
- **Last Round**: Since there's no future, all defect to secure maximum individual payoff.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Players switch to defection when the stock falls below half capacity to prevent further depletion.

### 3. Collective Alignment:
The strategy aligns with a collective mindset by prioritizing stock sustainability early on and gradually allowing self-interest as resources dwindle, ensuring a balance between cooperation and individual payoffs.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def ACT_strategy Parameters(n, r, capacity):
    for each round from 1 to r:
        if it's the first round:
            action = C
        elif it's the last round:
            action = D
        else:
            current_stock = observe_state()
            threshold = capacity / 2
            if current_stock > threshold:
                action = C
            else:
                action = D
        take_action(action)
```

### Explanation:
- **First Round**: Cooperation sets a high initial stock, promoting growth.
- **Middle Rounds**: Players cooperate if the stock is healthy (>50% capacity), ensuring sustainability. They defect when the stock is low to protect their payoffs.
- **Last Round**: Defection is rationalized as there’s no future impact.

This strategy is robust against various behaviors and adapts dynamically based on observable state, ensuring both individual and collective interests are addressed throughout the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_413 = '''
To maintain a balance between maximizing individual payoffs and sustaining the stock for future rounds, the following collective strategy can be employed:

### Collective Strategy for Balancing Cooperation and Defection

1. **Initial Round (t=1):**
   - All players Cooperate (C). This sets a high initial stock level, promoting growth.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
   - **Step 1:** Each player counts the number of Defectors (D_{t-1}) from the previous round.
   - **Step 2:** Determine if punishment is warranted:
     - If D_{t-1} exceeds a threshold (e.g., 20% of total players), initiate punishment for Z rounds (e.g., 2 rounds).
   - **Step 3:** During punishment rounds, all players Defect (D) to penalize excessive previous defection.
   - **Step 4:** After completing Z punishment rounds, assess stock recovery:
     - If the stock has increased compared to pre-punishment levels, switch back to Cooperate.
     - If not, continue defecting until recovery is observed.

3. **Non-Punishment Rounds:**
   - If D_{t-1} is below the threshold and the stock is healthy (e.g., above 70% capacity), players continue to Cooperate.

This strategy encourages cooperation while deterring excessive defection through temporary punishment, aiming to sustain a healthy stock level for long-term benefits.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_414 = '''
**Collective Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACWP)**

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating in the first round to establish trust and maximize initial payoffs without risking exploitation.

- **Monitor Cooperation Rate:** After the first round, calculate the average cooperation rate from all players in the previous round. If 80% or more of the players cooperated, continue Cooperating. If less than 80% cooperated, switch to Defecting for the next round as a form of punishment.

- **Stock Level Consideration:** Continuously monitor the stock level. If it falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), defect in subsequent rounds until the stock recovers above this threshold, indicating sufficient regeneration and potential renewed cooperation.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate trust and observe others' behaviors without immediate risk.
  
- **Last Round:** In the final round, switch to Defecting regardless of previous actions, as there’s no future punishment possible, aligning with the reality that others are likely to defect.

**3. Collective Alignment:**

- **Common Knowledge:** All players use the same strategy based on observable history and current state, ensuring coordinated behavior without communication.

- **Punishment Mechanism:** The strategy serves as a deterrent against defection by reducing cooperation when others defect, encouraging a return to cooperative behavior for mutual benefit.

**4. Adaptive Flexibility:**

- **Grace Period:** After punishing with Defection, monitor if cooperation resumes. If the cooperation rate rises above 80% again, revert to Cooperating to rebuild trust and stock levels.

This strategy balances the need to maintain cooperation for long-term payoffs with the necessity to punish defectors to prevent exploitation, ensuring a robust and adaptive approach in various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_415 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and observe other players' actions without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Monitoring Phase:**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** After each round, check if the stock level drops below 50% of capacity.
     - **If Above Threshold:** Continue cooperating (C) to sustain the resource.
     - **If Below Threshold:** Switch to defecting (D) for the next round to either conserve or signal disapproval.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - **Defection Round:** If stock falls below threshold, defect in the subsequent round.
   - **Return to Cooperation:** After defecting once, revert to cooperation if the stock begins to recover (i.e., increases towards capacity).

4. **Final Rounds Adaptation:**
   - **Last Round Strategy:** In the final round, decide based on historical cooperation:
     - **If Others Were Mostly Cooperative:** Cooperate to maximize joint payoff.
     - **If Others Defected Frequently:** Defect to secure personal gain, as future consequences are absent.

5. **Adaptive Adjustment:**
   - **Track Stock Trends:** Continuously monitor the stock's recovery after each defection.
   - **Flexible Threshold:** Adjust the threshold dynamically based on observed behavior to balance punishment and conservation.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, aiming to maintain resource sustainability while adapting to others' actions. It promotes collective benefit by conserving the stock when possible and adjusting behavior in response to exploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_416 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for each player in this scenario, we consider a cooperative approach that incorporates punishment mechanisms to deter excessive defection while maintaining sustainability of the stock. The strategy is designed based on perfect information and mutual rationality among players.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:** All players start by Cooperating. This maximizes their individual payoffs as well as sustains the stock level through balanced consumption and growth.

2. **Observation of Previous Actions:** After each round, every player observes whether others Cooperated or Defected. Given perfect information, they can count the exact number of Defectors in the previous round.

3. **Threshold for Punishment:** Players agree implicitly (through game-theoretic rationality) on a threshold to determine when to switch strategies. The chosen threshold is that if more than half of the players Defected in the last round, it triggers a punishment phase.

4. **Punishment Phase:** If the number of Defectors in the previous round exceeds the threshold (more than half), each player switches to Defecting in the current round. This acts as a retaliatory measure to punish those who defected and deter future defections.

5. **Return to Cooperation:** Once the number of Defectors falls below the threshold, players revert to Cooperating, resuming sustainable stock management.

**Conclusion:**

Each player should adopt a strategy where they Cooperate unless more than half of the players Defected in the previous round. This balanced approach maintains cooperation while effectively punishing widespread defection, thus optimizing both individual and collective outcomes.

**Final Answer:** The optimal strategy is for each player to Cooperate unless more than half of the players Defected in the previous round; otherwise, they should Defect. Thus, the final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if fewer than half defected last round; otherwise, Defect}}

     - If k > n/2, defect (D) in the current round to prevent over-exploitation.
   - **Stock Level Check:** Monitor the current stock level. If it falls below 25% of capacity, defect (D) to secure immediate payoff.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

This strategy balances cooperation with adaptive defection based on others' behavior and stock levels, ensuring sustainability while protecting individual payoffs when necessary.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, all players cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and maintain the stock at its maximum capacity.
   - **Reciprocity Mechanism:** After the initial round, each player's action depends on the previous round's stock level:
     - If the stock remains above 90% of capacity after their move, continue cooperating (C).
     - If the stock drops below 80%, switch to defecting (D) for the next one or two rounds as a punitive measure.
   - **Stock Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the stock level. Cooperate if the stock is healthy; defect if it's depleting significantly due to others' defections.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to set a positive precedent and maintain maximum stock.
   - **Last Round:** If the stock is above 80% capacity, continue cooperating. If below, defect only if necessary to avoid depletion but consider future sustainability.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** When stock is critically low (e.g., below 20%), prioritize immediate gains by defecting to ensure some payoff.

3. **Collectivist Approach:**
   - Prioritize the sustainability of the common pool for long-term mutual benefit over short-term individual gains.
   - Use defection strategically as punishment to deter others from exploiting the resource, ensuring collective cooperation is maintained.

This strategy balances cooperation and reciprocity, adapting to the game's dynamics while promoting a collectivist mindset to sustain the resource effectively.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_419 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rule:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a norm of cooperation and maximize initial stock sustainability.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - Observe the previous round's actions and payoffs.
     - If a majority of players cooperated and the stock remains above a sustainable threshold, continue cooperating.
     - If significant defection occurred or the stock level is declining rapidly, switch to defecting (D) to protect against exploitation.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to initiate cooperation.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since future consequences are absent.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., capacity divided by n), shift towards defection more frequently.

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   - Promote cooperation when others reciprocate and the stock is healthy.
   - Punish recent defections by adapting strategy to protect individual payoffs, maintaining fairness and sustainability.

This adaptive approach balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors while fostering a collective benefit.

description_COLLECTIVE_420 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we need a balanced approach that encourages cooperation while being robust against defection. The strategy should adapt based on the game's state and history to maintain a sustainable stock level for maximum long-term payoff.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Trigger Defection

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone, maximizing the stock's sustainability from the beginning.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Cooperate** if both of the following conditions are met:
     1. The current stock level is above 75% of the game's capacity.
     2. Less than 20% of players defected in the previous round (i.e., fewer than 0.2n players chose D).
   - **Defect** if either condition is not met. This adaptive response helps prevent stock depletion and punishes excessive defection.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Always Defect (D). Since there are no future consequences, maximizing immediate payoff is optimal.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation encourages others to do the same, maintaining a high stock level.
- **Stock Threshold**: The 75% threshold ensures that cooperation continues as long as the stock remains healthy. Defecting when the stock is lower helps recover it by potentially reducing total consumption.
- **Defection Punishment**: Limiting defection to cases where more than 20% of players defected discourages excessive exploitation while allowing flexibility.
- **Last Round Defection**: Maximizes personal gain without future repercussions, aligning with the game's final round dynamics.

This strategy balances individual and collective interests, promoting sustainability while adapting to others' actions. It fosters cooperation but isn't overly vulnerable to exploitation, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_421 = '''
The collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability through adaptive cooperation and graduated retaliation. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview: Cooperative Punishment with Gradual Escalation

1. **Initial Cooperation (Rounds 1-3):**
   - Cooperate in the first three rounds to establish trust and maintain stock levels.

2. **Reciprocal Cooperation:**
   - After the initial period, determine cooperation based on the average cooperation rate of all players over the last few rounds.
   - If at least 80% of players cooperated recently, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect.

3. **Gradual Escalation:**
   - Track each player's defections and respond with increasing defection probability (up to 50%) per offense, resetting if cooperation resumes sufficiently.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Defect if stock is below a threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity) to maximize immediate gain.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If stock falls below a critical point, defect to secure remaining resources.

This strategy promotes cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation, ensuring resource sustainability and adapting to others' behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_422 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Objective**: Balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, encouraging cooperation while adapting to others' behavior.

2. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C) to initiate trust and observe others' actions.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**: 
     - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity and most players cooperated previously, continue to Cooperate.
     - If the stock drops below this threshold or many defected before, switch to Defect (D).
   - **Last Round**: Continue cooperating unless the stock is already low, prioritizing sustainability over immediate gain.

3. **Adaptation Mechanism**:
   - Monitor the stock trend and overall depletion rate.
   - Use a trigger strategy: Cooperate if stock remains above 50% of capacity; otherwise, defect.

4. **Reciprocity and Punishment**: Incorporate reciprocity by retaliating against previous defections while allowing for forgiveness if cooperation resumes.

5. **Stock Management**:
   - Aim to maintain the stock level after growth above a sustainable threshold to ensure future payoffs.
   - Use the stock's growth function to balance consumption and replenishment effectively.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - In early rounds, focus on building trust through cooperation.
   - In the final round, avoid last-minute overconsumption unless necessary for maximizing payoff without harming sustainability.

This strategy promotes a collective mindset by encouraging cooperation while being robust against exploitation, ensuring both immediate and future benefits are considered.

- **Defect (D):** If the stock drops below 50% or more than half the players defected last round, defect to prevent further depletion and signal displeasure.

**2. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to establish trust and maximize initial stock regeneration.
- **Last Round:** Assess previous actions; if overall cooperation was high, cooperate to end on a sustainable note, else defect to maximize immediate gain.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
The strategy encourages reciprocity and sustainability by mirroring past behavior and adjusting based on stock health, promoting collective well-being through adaptive responses.

description_COLLECTIVE_424 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection. This strategy aims to maximize each player's total payoff while maintaining the sustainability of the common resource.

### Strategy: Adaptive Collective Cooperation with Reciprocal Defection

1. **First Round Action**:
   - **Cooperate (C)**: All players start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial payoffs without depleting the stock excessively.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Past Actions**: Track the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - **Stock Assessment**: Evaluate the current stock level after consumption and growth from the previous round.
   
   **Decision Rules**:
   - **Continue Cooperating (C)**: If fewer than half of the players defected last round AND the stock is above 50% of capacity, continue cooperating to sustain the resource and maintain high payoffs.
   - **Defect (D)**: If at least half of the players defected last round OR the stock has dropped below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), defect to protect individual payoffs or signal dissatisfaction with others' actions.

3. **Reciprocal Forgiveness Mechanism**:
   - **Revert to Cooperation**: If, after a defection, a significant number of players return to cooperation and the stock begins to recover, switch back to cooperating. This encourages mutual cooperation and resource sustainability.
   
4. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - **Optimize for Immediate Payoffs**: In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds), especially when the stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains since future sustainability becomes less relevant.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_collective_strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'  # First round: Cooperate
    
    previous_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
    stock_level = history[-1]['stock_after_growth']
    
    # Parameters
    defect_threshold = 0.5  # If fraction of defectors >= this, defect next round
    stock_critical_threshold = 0.3 * capacity  # Critical stock level
    
    rounds_remaining = r - len(history)
    endgame_threshold = 0.1 * r  # Last 10% of rounds are endgame
    
    if num_defectors / n >= defect_threshold or stock_level < stock_critical_threshold:
        if rounds_remaining <= endgame_threshold and stock_level < 0.2 * capacity:
            return 'D'  # Endgame defect
        else:
            return 'D'  # Defect due to high defection or low stock
    else:
        return 'C'  # Continue cooperating
    
    # Implement reciprocal forgiveness by tracking trends in cooperation over past rounds
    recent_cooperation_trend = [action for action in history[-5:]['actions']]
    if len(recent_cooperation_trend) >= 5 and all(action == 'C' for action in recent_cooperation_trend):
        return 'C'  # Forgive and cooperate again

```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, players set a cooperative tone that can lead to higher initial payoffs.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: The strategy adapts based on the collective behavior of other players and the state of the stock, ensuring flexibility in response to varying scenarios.
- **Reciprocal Forgiveness**: This mechanism allows for reversion to cooperation if others signal a return to cooperative behavior, promoting a balance between punishment and cooperation.
- **Endgame Optimization**: In the final stages, when sustainability is less critical, the strategy shifts focus to immediate gains.

This approach ensures that each player acts in their self-interest while contributing to the collective good, making it robust against diverse opponent behaviors.

To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation while avoiding exploitation, we propose a strategy that combines both stock-level triggers and history-based responses. Here's how it works:

### Strategy Overview

1. **First Round**: Always cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and resource conservation.
2. **Last Round (t = r)**: Defect to maximize personal gain since there are no future rounds to consider.
3. **Other Rounds**:
   - If the current stock level drops below 75% of capacity, defect to prevent overexploitation.
   - Additionally, check if the previous round's total consumption exceeded the expected cooperative benchmark (S_prev / 2). If it did, defect in the current round as a punitive measure.

### Detailed Explanation

- **First Round**: Cooperate to start with mutual cooperation, ensuring initial resource conservation.
- **Last Round**: Defect because there are no future consequences, allowing maximum personal benefit.
- **Other Rounds**:
  - **Stock-Level Check**: If the stock falls below 75% of its capacity, switch to defecting to avoid depleting the resource further.
  - **History-Based Punishment**: Monitor if previous round's total consumption exceeded expected cooperative levels. If so, defect to punish past defections and deter future exploitation.

### Implementation Code

```python
def strategy(state):
    current_round = state.round_number
    capacity = state.capacity
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    if current_round > len(state.history) + 1:  # Ensure we don't go beyond the last round
        pass
    
    if current_round == state.total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    S_current = state.stock_level
    capacity_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    
    if S_current < capacity_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    prev_round = state.history[-1]
    S_prev = prev_round.stock_before_consumption
    EC = S_prev / 2  # Expected cooperative total consumption
    TC_last = sum(prev_round.player_contribution.values())  # Sum of all players' contributions last round
    
    if TC_last > EC:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Conclusion

This strategy aims to maintain cooperation as long as the stock remains healthy and other players behave cooperatively. It switches to defection when necessary to prevent overexploitation or punish past defections, balancing individual gain with resource sustainability.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Collective Management (ACM)

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This initiates the game with maximum collective benefit, setting a cooperative tone and preserving stock levels.

- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock is below half of capacity, switch to Defect (D) to protect against potential over-depletion.
  - **Cooperation Quotient:** Calculate the average cooperation rate from the previous round. If fewer than half cooperated, choose D; otherwise, continue with C.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **Last Round:** Cooperate if stock is above a quarter of capacity to maintain sustainability beyond the game's end.
- **Low Stock (near zero):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are limited.
- **Full Capacity:** Cooperate to sustain the resource for maximum long-term benefit.

**3. Collective Alignment:**

The strategy promotes sustainability by balancing individual payoffs with collective resource management, ensuring the stock remains viable across all rounds.

### Pseudocode

```python
def adaptive_collective_management(n, r, capacity, history):
    if len(history) == 0:
        return "C"
    
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    previous_actions = [action for action in history[-1]['actions']]
    
    # Determine number of cooperators in the last round
    num_coop = sum(1 for a in previous_actions if a == 'C')
    coop_rate = num_coop / n
    
    # Check stock level against threshold
    if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
        return "D"
    
    # Adjust based on cooperation rate
    if coop_rate < 0.5:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"

# Example usage in a round
n = 4
capacity = 100
history = [...]  # List of previous rounds' data

action = adaptive_collective_management(n, capacity, history)
print(action)
```

This strategy adaptively responds to the game's state and opponents' actions, promoting cooperation while safeguarding against over-exploitation.

To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed an approach that balances individual gain with collective sustainability by considering both the current stock level and historical cooperation rates. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACST)

**Objective:**  
Maintain a sustainable common pool resource while maximizing individual payoffs through adaptive cooperation based on observed actions and stock levels.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** Start by cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Calculate Cooperation Rate:** Track the average cooperation rate over the last `k` rounds, where `k` is a small number relative to total rounds `r`.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock level falls below 50% of capacity, switch to Cooperate (C) regardless of historical actions.
   - **Cooperation Rate Threshold:** If the cooperation rate exceeds 70%, continue Cooperating. Otherwise, Defect (D).

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Use a moving average for cooperation rates, giving more weight to recent actions to adapt to changing behaviors.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Last Round Consideration:** The strategy doesn't require special handling as the focus is on sustainability across all rounds.
- **Stock Recovery:** If stock drops below 50% of capacity, prioritize recovery by cooperating until levels rebound.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
class PlayerStrategy:
    def __init__(self, n, capacity):
        self.n = n
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.stock_history = [capacity]
        self.cooperation_rates = []
        self.k = min(5, r)  # Number of past rounds to consider

    def decide_action(self, current_stock, round_num):
        if round_num == 1:
            return 'C'
        
        # Calculate average cooperation rate over the last k rounds
        coop_rate = sum(self.cooperation_rates[-self.k:]) / self.k if len(self.cooperation_rates) >= self.k else 0.5
        
        # Check stock threshold
        critical_threshold = 0.5 * self.capacity
        if current_stock < critical_threshold:
            return 'C'
        
        # Determine action based on cooperation rate
        if coop_rate > 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

    def update_history(self, current_stock, action):
        self.stock_history.append(current_stock)
        self.cooperation_rates.append(1 if action == 'C' else 0)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization:** Start with the stock at full capacity and initialize cooperation rate tracking.
- **First Round Cooperation:** Establishes a cooperative baseline.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Adjusts actions based on recent cooperation trends and critical stock levels to prevent depletion.
- **Stock Recovery Mechanism:** Ensures that if the resource is critically low, all players cooperate to replenish it.

This strategy promotes sustainability while being responsive to others' behaviors, fostering a balance between individual and collective interests.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_428 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we can adopt an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection when necessary. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment and Forgiveness (ACPF)

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, all players cooperate to establish trust and maximize initial stock regrowth.

2. **Sustainability Check:**
   - For subsequent rounds, calculate the total consumption in the previous round.
   - Determine if this consumption exceeds the sustainable level (i.e., more than half of the stock was consumed).

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - If excessive consumption occurred, indicating sufficient defection, players defect in the next round as a form of punishment.

4. **Forgiveness Threshold:**
   - Implement a 25% threshold for the fraction of excess consumption to decide if punishment is warranted.

5. **Stock Recovery Check:**
   - Always ensure that cooperation does not drop the stock below a critical level; if so, switch back to cooperation to allow recovery.

6. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final rounds (last 10%), players shift towards maximizing short-term gains by defecting more frequently.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(n, r, capacity, stock_history, action_history):
    current_round = len(stock_history)
    
    if current_round == 0:
        return "C"
    
    previous_stock = stock_history[-1]
    previous_actions = action_history[-1]
    
    # Calculate sustainable consumption level for the previous round
    sustainable_consumption = previous_stock / 2
    
    total_previous_consumption = sum([a_contribution(previous_stock, a) for a in previous_actions])
    
    excess_consumption_fraction = max(0, (total_previous_consumption - sustainable_consumption)) / sustainable_consumption
    
    if current_round >= 0.9 * r:
        return "D"
    
    if previous_stock < capacity / 2 and excess_consumption_fraction > 0.25:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"

def a_contribution(stock, action):
    n_players = len(action)
    if action == 'C':
        return stock / (2 * n_players)
    else:
        return stock / n_players
```

### Strategy Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a cooperative tone and allows the stock to regenerate fully.
- **Sustainability Check:** By comparing total consumption against a sustainable threshold, players can detect when others are defecting excessively.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** Defecting after excessive consumption discourages others from over-exploiting the resource without facing consequences.
- **Forgiveness Threshold:** A 25% threshold allows for some leniency, preventing perpetual punishment cycles and encouraging return to cooperation.
- **Stock Recovery Check:** Ensures that the strategy prioritizes resource sustainability, switching back to cooperation if the stock is at risk of severe depletion.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Recognizing the game's end, players prioritize immediate gains in the final rounds.

This strategy promotes long-term sustainability while adapting to others' actions, balancing punishment and forgiveness to maintain a healthy stock level across all rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_429 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperativeness**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate unconditionally to establish a cooperative baseline.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - Calculate the number of defectors from the previous round.
     - If more than 50% of players defected or if the stock level drops below 20% of capacity, defect in the current round.
     - Otherwise, continue cooperating.
   - **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff without future consequences.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage initial sustainability.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If stock is critically low (e.g., below 20% of capacity), defect to secure remaining resources.
   - **Last Round:** Prioritize personal gain by defecting, as there's no future impact.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - The strategy promotes cooperation when mutually beneficial and switches to self-preservation when others exploit the resource excessively or when the stock is depleted significantly.

This approach balances reciprocity with self-interest, ensuring players adapt based on group behavior and environmental state, fostering sustainability while protecting individual payoffs when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_430 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

1. **Initialization**: All players start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and resource sustainability.

2. **Stock Monitoring**: After each round, each player observes the current stock level \( S_t \) relative to the game's capacity.

3. **Threshold Check**:
   - If \( S_t \) falls below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), the player switches to defecting for a set number of subsequent rounds (e.g., 3 rounds). This acts as a punishment phase to deter overexploitation.
   - The threshold is dynamically adjusted based on game parameters, such as the number of players and rounds, ensuring adaptability across different scenarios.

4. **Recovery Phase**: Once the stock recovers above another higher threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), indicating sufficient regeneration and potential return to cooperative behavior, the player resumes cooperating.

5. **Repeat**: The strategy continues to monitor stock levels and adjust actions accordingly throughout all rounds, ensuring a balance between maintaining resource sustainability and discouraging excessive exploitation.

This approach promotes cooperation while incorporating a robust mechanism to counteract overexploitation, ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource without requiring explicit communication or coordination among players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_431 = '''
To determine the optimal strategy for the given scenario, we consider balancing cooperation to maintain a healthy stock level with the need to retaliate against defection and maximize payoffs in later rounds. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a high stock level.
2. **Monitor Defection:** After each round, calculate the number of defectors (k_prev) using the change in stock levels before and after consumption.
3. **Adjust Strategy:**
   - If more than half the players defected last round (k_prev > n/2), defect this round.
   - Cooperate if the current stock is above 50% of capacity; otherwise, defect to maximize immediate gain.
4. **Final Round:** Always defect in the last round to secure maximum payoff when future rounds no longer matter.

**Answer:**

Cooperate on all rounds except when more than half the players defected previously or the stock falls below 50%, and always defect in the final round.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_432 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining the stock level while maximizing individual payoffs in a cooperative game, we can implement a strategy that combines initial cooperation with adaptive adjustments based on observed outcomes. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Level Feedback

1. **Initial Rounds (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Establish a high stock level and set a precedent for cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** After each round, evaluate the stock level relative to capacity.
     - **Threshold:** Set a threshold at 75% of the maximum capacity (e.g., 75 for n=4).
     - **Adjustment:** If the stock drops below this threshold, increase cooperation in the next rounds; if it remains above, allow defection but carefully to avoid depletion.

3. **Punish Defectors:**
   - **Track Cooperation Rate:** Calculate the average cooperation rate over recent rounds.
   - **Response:** If the cooperation rate falls below a set threshold (e.g., 70%), defect in subsequent rounds to protect individual payoffs.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - **Balance Near End:** As the game progresses, especially nearing its conclusion, balance between current payoffs and stock sustainability.
   - **Adaptation:** In later rounds, allow for more defection but monitor the stock to ensure it doesn't deplete before the final round.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(current_round, total_rounds, stock_level, capacity, past_actions):
    # Initial Round: Always Cooperate
    if current_round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Calculate Cooperation Rate from Past Actions
    cooperation_rate = sum(1 for action in past_actions if action == "Cooperate") / len(past_actions)
    
    # Thresholds
    stock_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    
    # Decision Logic
    if stock_level < stock_threshold:
        return "Cooperate"
    elif cooperation_rate < 0.7:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        # Towards the end, balance between cooperate and defect
        if current_round > total_rounds - 5:
            # Mix strategy with higher defection probability near end
            # Example: Defect with 60% chance
            import random
            return "Defect" if random.random() < 0.6 else "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Cooperate"

# Example Usage:
past_actions = ["Cooperate", "Defect", "Cooperate", "Cooperate"]
capacity = 100
stock_level = 80
total_rounds = 20
current_round = 5

action = strategy(current_round, total_rounds, stock_level, capacity, past_actions)
print(action)  # Output depends on calculations and random module if applicable
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a positive tone and maintains high stock levels.
- **Stock-Level Feedback:** Adjusts behavior based on whether the stock is above or below a critical threshold, ensuring sustainability.
- **Cooperation Rate Tracking:** Encourages reciprocity by rewarding past cooperation and deterring excessive defection.
- **Endgame Balancing:** Nears the end of the game with a strategic mix to maximize final payoffs without depleting the stock prematurely.

This strategy ensures that players adapt their behavior dynamically, promoting cooperation when necessary while allowing for strategic defection to maximize individual gains.

description_COLLECTIVE_433 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable resource in a multiplayer game where each player can choose to cooperate (C) or defect (D), we propose a strategy that balances cooperation with safeguards against excessive defection. This approach uses observed stock levels to guide decisions, promoting sustainability while protecting against over-exploitation.

### Strategy Summary:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same and maximize initial resource conservation.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each round, observe the current stock level relative to the capacity (C).

3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - **Cooperate** if the stock remains above a defined threshold (e.g., 90% of C). This continues to support sustainability.
   - **Defect** if the stock drops below this threshold, signaling dissatisfaction and aiming to enforce cooperation.

4. **Trend Consideration**: Instead of reacting to a single drop, consider the trend over multiple rounds. For example, defect only if the stock has decreased for two consecutive rounds to avoid over-reaction.

5. **Revert to Cooperation**: Once the stock begins to recover (possibly due to others resuming cooperation), switch back to cooperating to rebuild the resource.

### Conclusion:

This strategy encourages initial cooperation and uses stock levels as a guide to adapt behavior, balancing individual payoffs with collective sustainability. It aims to maintain a healthy resource level while safeguarding against excessive defection through responsive decision-making.

description_COLLECTIVE_434 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round of a game with perfect information and a focus on maintaining stock levels for sustainable use, we can outline a strategic approach based on observable factors. The strategy balances punishing recent defection, maintaining healthy stock levels, and adjusting behavior appropriately, especially in the final round.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate to initiate mutual cooperation and establish a baseline of trust.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Before Last):**
   - **Step 1:** Count how many players defected in the previous round (D_prev).
   - **Step 2:** If D_prev exceeds 25% of the total number of players OR the current stock level is below half of the capacity, choose to Defect this round as a form of punishment and to prevent further depletion.
   - **Step 3:** Otherwise, continue Cooperating to maintain high stock levels and encourage mutual benefit.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Step 1:** Assess the current stock level.
   - **Step 2:** If the stock is above 75% of capacity and most players have cooperated in previous rounds, choose to Cooperate to sustain the high stock level.
   - **Step 3:** Otherwise, Defect in the last round to maximize personal gain, as there are no future consequences for cooperation.

### Summary:

- The strategy prioritizes maintaining healthy stock levels by cooperating when necessary and defecting when significant defection is observed or when the stock is too low.
- It includes a final-round adjustment to either cooperate if conditions are favorable or defect to maximize immediate gain.
- This approach aims to balance cooperation with strategic punishment, ensuring sustainable use while protecting against exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_435 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for the repeated game scenario where each player can choose to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), we need to balance immediate payoffs with future sustainability. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy:

1. **First Round**: All players should Cooperate (C). This ensures that the stock remains at its maximum level, providing a sustainable foundation for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Threshold Check**: In each round after the first, evaluate the current stock level (S). If S is above 50% of the capacity, continue to Cooperate.
   - **Stock Recovery**: If S drops below this threshold, players should still Cooperate to allow the stock to recover. Defecting when the stock is low exacerbates the problem and reduces future payoffs for everyone.

3. **Last Round**: In the final round (round r), all players should Defect (D). Since there are no subsequent rounds to worry about, maximizing immediate payoff takes precedence without concerns for future sustainability.

This strategy encourages cooperation to maintain high stock levels throughout most of the game and then maximizes extraction in the final round when it doesn't harm future outcomes.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_436 = '''
To address the challenge of deciding when to cooperate or defect in a dynamic environment where stock levels indicate others' actions, I propose a strategy that balances cooperation for long-term gains with strategic defection to protect individual payoffs. The strategy adapts based on observed changes in stock levels and considers the number of rounds remaining.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Cooperate Initially:** Begin by cooperating to maintain high stock levels.
2. **Respond to Stock Changes:** 
   - If the stock decreases, defect in subsequent rounds until the stock shows signs of recovery.
3. **Rebuild When Necessary:** If the stock falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% capacity), switch back to cooperation to allow replenishment.
4. **Maximize Final Rounds:** In the last few rounds, especially the final one, defect to secure immediate benefits since future consequences are limited.

### Detailed Strategy:
1. **Early Rounds (Rounds 1 to r-2):**
   - Cooperate unless the previous round resulted in a stock decrease, indicating defection by others.
   - If a decrease is observed, defect for one or two rounds as a response.

2. **Penultimate Round (Round r-1):**
   - Assess the current stock level and past trends. If the stock is high and stable, continue cooperating. If it's been declining, consider defecting strategically.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future rounds affected by this decision.

### Summary:
This strategy integrates cooperation for sustained benefits with targeted defection in response to others' actions or when nearing the end of the game. It aims to adapt dynamically based on stock level changes and remaining rounds to optimize both immediate and long-term payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_437 = '''
### Strategy: **Adaptive Collective Optimization (ACO)**

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes initial payoffs while preserving the stock for future rounds.
  
- **Intermediate Rounds:** 
  - If in the previous round, fewer than half of the players cooperated, defect (D) to avoid being exploited. Continue defecting for up to two consecutive rounds after observing widespread defection to signal retaliation.
  - If the current stock is below a threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), cooperate (C) to help replenish the stock.
  
- **Last Round:** Defect (D). Since there’s no future punishment, maximize immediate payoff.

#### 2. Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Always cooperate to establish cooperation and maintain a high initial stock.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops critically low (e.g., below 20% of capacity), switch to cooperation to allow regeneration.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize short-term gain without fear of future repercussions.

#### 3. Collective Mindset:
The strategy prioritizes cooperation when it benefits the group’s long-term payoff but adaptively defects to prevent exploitation or depletion. It encourages reciprocity and stock preservation, ensuring sustainability across all rounds.

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def aco_strategy(game_state):
    if game_state['round'] == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif game_state['round'] == game_state['total_rounds']:
        return 'D'
    else:
        previous_actions = game_state['previous_actions']
        cooperation_rate = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'C') / len(previous_actions)
        
        if cooperation_rate < 0.5 and not in_punishment_phase():
            start_punishment_phase()
            return 'D'
        elif cooperation_rate >= 0.5:
            end_punishment_phase()
            if game_state['current_stock'] < 0.2 * game_state['capacity']:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'C'  # Continue cooperating

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring the collective maximizes payoffs while maintaining a sustainable stock level.

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline of mutual cooperation and preserve the stock.
  
- **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):**
  - Monitor the stock level after each round. If the stock is decreasing over two consecutive rounds, indicating potential defection by others, switch to Defect for one round as a punitive measure.
  - After defecting once, return to Cooperate if the stock begins to recover in the subsequent round.

- **Last Round (r):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact on the stock.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- If the stock drops significantly below capacity early on, trigger a temporary switch to Defect to prevent further depletion.
- If the stock remains at or near capacity consistently, continue Cooperating to maintain high payoffs sustainably.

**3. Collective Alignment:**

The strategy promotes cooperation as the default behavior, encouraging others to do the same by reciprocating their actions. It adaptively punishes defection to maintain a balance between individual gain and collective sustainability.

This approach ensures that each player contributes to the preservation of the common pool while protecting against exploitation, adapting dynamically based on observed outcomes.

To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for maximizing payoffs while considering sustainability, we can outline a clear approach based on the stock level after each round. The strategy balances cooperation to maintain healthy stock levels with defection to maximize individual gains when necessary or at the end.

**Strategy:**

1. **First Round**: Always cooperate (play "C").
2. For rounds 2 to r-1:
   - Let \( S_{t-1} \) be the stock level after growth in round \( t-1 \).
   - If \( S_{t-1} > \frac{\text{capacity}}{2} \): Cooperate ("C").
   - Else: Defect ("D").
3. **Last Round (r)**: Always defect ("D").

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and maintain the stock level.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each round, check if the stock after growth is above half of its capacity. If it is, continue cooperating to preserve the stock for future rounds.
3. **Defect When Necessary**: If the stock falls below half capacity, defect in the next round to secure higher individual payoffs before potential depletion.
4. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, always defect to maximize your payoff since there are no subsequent rounds to affect.

This approach ensures that players maintain cooperation while the stock is healthy but switch strategies when sustainability is at risk or in the final round for maximum gain.

To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation in a repeated game with no communication among players, while also considering the temptation to defect for immediate gains, I propose the following strategy:

**Strategy: "Cooperate Until Significant Depletion"**

1. **First Round:**
   - All players cooperate. This establishes an initial trust and maximizes the stock at capacity.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (from Round 2 to Round r-1):**
   - Each player checks the stock level after growth from the previous round.
     - If the stock ever drops below **50% of the capacity**, all players switch to defecting for all remaining rounds.
     - If the stock remains above or equal to 50%, continue cooperating.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - All players defect to maximize their immediate payoff, as there are no future consequences.

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation ensures the stock begins at maximum capacity.
- **Threshold for Depletion:** The 50% threshold acts as a clear signal that significant depletion has occurred, triggering a shift to defection to prevent further loss.
- **Last Round Defection:** Recognizing that without future repercussions, players maximize their final payoff by defecting.

This strategy balances cooperation with self-interest, ensuring that while the group benefit is maintained, individual payoffs are secured once cooperation becomes unsustainable.

To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for playing the game where each player's payoff depends on both current actions and past depletion of a shared resource, we need a balance between cooperation and defection. The goal is to maximize individual payoffs while ensuring the resource isn't depleted too quickly, which would harm future payoffs.

### Strategy Overview

The proposed strategy combines elements of cooperation and defection, adapting based on the game's progression and the state of the shared resource (stock). It aims to sustain the stock in early rounds and transition towards maximizing individual gains as the game nears its end.

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - Cooperate in the first few rounds to build up the stock and ensure it doesn't deplete too early.
   
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**:
   - Track the stock level after each round. If the stock drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to defection temporarily to protect individual payoffs.

3. **Adaptive Defection**:
   - As the game progresses and fewer rounds remain, gradually increase the tendency to defect. This ensures that players can secure higher payoffs in later rounds without worrying about depleting the stock too much for future rounds, as there are none left.

4. **Final Rounds**:
   - In the last few rounds, prioritize defection to maximize immediate gains since there's no future punishment or consequence after the game ends.

### Detailed Strategy

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This helps in building up the stock initially.
   
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the total consumption from the previous round and observe the stock level after growth.
   - If the stock is below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), defect in the next round to secure higher payoffs while the stock is still sufficient.
   - As the number of remaining rounds decreases, especially in the latter half of the game, increase defection to maximize personal gains.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the stock is already at or near zero, there's no benefit in cooperating, so defect.
   - In the very last round, defect to secure the maximum possible payoff since there are no future consequences.

### Conclusion

This strategy balances cooperation and defection, aiming to sustain the stock when necessary while allowing players to maximize their payoffs as the game concludes. It adaptively responds to the stock's condition and the game's progression, ensuring a pragmatic approach to resource management and personal gain.

description_COLLECTIVE_442 = '''
To address the challenge of managing the common pool resource effectively while balancing individual and collective interests, we propose a strategy based on monitoring the current stock level. This approach ensures that players cooperate when the stock is low to allow replenishment and defect when it's high enough to exploit resources for higher gains. Here's the structured strategy:

**Strategy: Threshold-Based Cooperation**

1. **Monitor Stock Level:** At each round, observe the current stock level (S_t) relative to the capacity (C).

2. **Threshold Check:** 
   - If S_t is below 50% of C (i.e., S_t < 0.5 * C), **Cooperate** in the next round.
   - If S_t is at or above 50% of C, **Defect** in the next round unless a significant number of players cooperated previously.

3. **Historical Cooperation Consideration:** When the stock is above the threshold, consider the cooperation rate from previous rounds. If more than half of the players cooperated last round, continue to Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

This strategy aims to conserve resources when they are scarce and allow for exploitation when they are abundant, encouraging sustainable use while adapting to collective behavior.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_443 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation while avoiding exploitation in a repeated game scenario, we can design a strategy based on reciprocal behavior. This approach encourages sustained cooperation but punishes excessive defection to prevent depletion of shared resources.

**Strategy: Modified Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative tone and maintain high resource levels.

2. **Monitor Previous Round's Defection Rate**: After each round, calculate the proportion of players who defected in the previous round.

3. **Threshold-Based Response**:
   - If the proportion of defectors in the last round exceeds 50%, defect in the current round as a form of punishment.
   - If the proportion is 50% or less, cooperate to maintain resource sustainability and encourage others' cooperation.

4. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After punishing by defecting, if the next round's defection rate drops below 50%, revert to cooperating. This allows recovery of cooperation over time.

5. **Endgame Consideration**: In the final rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds), players may choose to defect to maximize immediate payoffs since future punishments are less relevant.

This strategy balances punishment for widespread defection with forgiveness to allow cooperation to reestablish, aiming to maintain resource levels and long-term payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_444 = '''
To address the challenge of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round while considering both immediate gains and future sustainability, we can adopt a threshold-based strategy. This approach ensures that players maintain high stock levels when possible but switch to maximizing their own gain when the resource becomes significantly depleted.

### Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - All players will Cooperate.
     - Reasoning: Starting with cooperation sets a foundation for maintaining higher stock levels, which can lead to sustained payoffs in future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - After each round, observe the stock level after growth (S_prev).
   - If S_prev is greater than or equal to 75% of the capacity, continue Cooperating.
     - Reasoning: High stock levels indicate sustainable practices; continuing to Cooperate preserves this balance for future rounds.
   - If S_prev falls below 75% of the capacity, players will Defect in the current round.
     - Reasoning: A significant drop in stock level suggests that past actions were not sustainable. Defecting maximizes immediate payoffs when the resource is under threat.

### Explanation:

- **Threshold at 75% Capacity:** This threshold balances the desire to maintain a healthy, sustainable stock level with the need to adapt when the resource becomes depleted. It prevents the stock from crashing by encouraging Cooperate actions when levels are high enough but allows players to secure payoffs when sustainability is compromised.
  
- **Adaptation Based on Observed Stock Levels:** By reacting to the previous round's outcome, this strategy dynamically adjusts behavior without requiring knowledge of other players' strategies. It leverages perfect information to make informed decisions.

This approach aims to maximize overall payoff by maintaining cooperation during sustainable periods and strategically defecting when resource depletion becomes a concern.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_445 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Conservation (ACSC)**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of other players' initial moves.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Previous Actions**: Count the number of players who Cooperated (C) or Defected (D) in the prior round.
     - If >50% Cooperated and current stock is above 50% of capacity, choose to Cooperate again.
     - If ≤50% Cooperated or stock is below 20% of capacity:
       - If stock is critically low (<20%), switch to Cooperate to help replenish the resource.
       - Otherwise, Defect to protect your payoff in response to others' defection.

3. **Final Round Action**: Defect (D). Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds dependent on the current stock level.

**Rationale**:
- The strategy begins with cooperation to encourage a positive dynamic but adapts based on others' behavior.
- It rewards cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection when necessary, ensuring self-protection.
- Conservation of the resource is prioritized when stock levels are critically low, promoting sustainability for future rounds.

This approach balances collective benefit with individual protection, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_446 = '''
To design an effective collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance cooperation and defection to maintain a sustainable stock level while adapting to others' behavior. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Thresholds (ACST)

1. **First Round**: All players Cooperate (C) to start with a high stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Check**: If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, and most players cooperated in the previous round (cooperation rate > 50%), then Cooperate.
   - **Defection Trigger**: If the stock drops below 50% of capacity or fewer than half the players cooperated last round, switch to Defecting to prevent further depletion.

3. **Punishment Mechanism**: If a player defects, subsequent rounds will respond by defecting until cooperation resumes above the threshold.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round**: Cooperate if the stock is above 50% of capacity; otherwise, Defect.
   - **Low Stock Recovery**: Prioritize stock recovery by Cooperating if stock is critically low but showing signs of growth.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def acst_strategy(game_state):
    current_stock = game_state['stock']
    previous_actions = game_state['history'][-1]
    round_number = game_state['round']

    # First Round: Always Cooperate
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Calculate cooperation rate from last round's actions
    cooperators = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'C')
    cooperation_rate = cooperators / len(previous_actions)

    # Stock threshold check (50% of capacity)
    stock_threshold = game_state['capacity'] * 0.5

    if current_stock > stock_threshold and cooperation_rate > 0.5:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

    # Edge case handling for last round
    if round_number == game_state['total_rounds']:
        if current_stock > stock_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **First Round Cooperation**: Initiates the game with maximum cooperation to sustain the stock.
- **Stock Threshold**: Ensures that cooperation continues only when the stock is healthy, preventing over-depletion.
- **Cooperation Rate Check**: Encourages players to Cooperate if others are doing so, promoting collective benefit.
- **Punishment by Defection**: Deters excessive defection by reducing individual payoffs when cooperation drops.
- **Edge Cases Management**: Adjusts behavior in the last round and during low stock scenarios to balance immediate gain with future sustainability.

This strategy is adaptive, robust, and aligns all players towards a common goal of maintaining a sustainable resource, maximizing collective payoffs over the game's duration.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_447 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to set a cooperative tone and maximize initial stock growth.

2. **Stock Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the stock level after each round. If the stock remains above a target threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), continue cooperating. This encourages sustainable use and maintains future payoffs.

3. **Adaptive Defection**: If the stock falls below the threshold, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds. This protects individual payoffs when others are not cooperating or when the stock is depleting too rapidly.

4. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences beyond that round.

5. **Robustness**: The strategy adapts based on observed stock levels and opponent behaviors without requiring coordination, ensuring it performs well against various strategies in a tournament setting.

**Pseudocode Outline**:
```
Initialize:
    current_round = 1
    cooperate()

While current_round < r:
    Observe stock_level_after_last_round
    If stock_level > threshold (e.g., 0.7 * capacity):
        Cooperate()
    Else:
        Defect()
    current_round += 1

In last round (current_round == r):
    Defect()
```

This strategy balances collective cooperation with individual protection, ensuring long-term sustainability while adapting to the actions of others.

description_COLLECTIVE_448 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperative Management (ACM) for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** All players Cooperate (C). This establishes a baseline of cooperation and maintains the stock at its maximum capacity.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** Implement a Forgiving Tit-for-Tat strategy:
     - If all players Cooperated in the previous round, continue to Cooperate.
     - If any player Defected last round, retaliate by Defecting once, then return to Cooperating if others Cooperate again.
   - **Stock Level Adaptation:**
     - If the stock falls below 70% of capacity, all players switch to Cooperate in the next round to allow replenishment.
   - **Final Round:** All players Cooperate to maximize total payoff without depleting the stock.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Always start with Cooperation to set a cooperative tone.
   - **Low Stock Scenario:** If the stock is critically low, prioritize recovery through Cooperation regardless of previous actions.
   - **Last Round:** Cooperate to ensure the highest possible payoff without compromising future stocks (even though there are no more rounds, it maintains consistency).

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   The strategy promotes sustained resource availability by balancing immediate gains with long-term stock health, encouraging cooperation while deterring defection through targeted retaliation and adaptive stock management.

This approach ensures that players act collectively to maintain the resource, adapt to others' behaviors, and prioritize stock sustainability for maximum overall payoff.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_449 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Stock Conservation (ARSC)**

The ARSC strategy is designed to balance cooperation and self-interest by adapting based on the game's state and history. It encourages cooperation to maintain a healthy stock level while allowing for defection when necessary to maximize individual payoffs.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to start with a collective effort to preserve the stock.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If in the previous round, more than half of the players cooperated AND the stock level is above 50% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
   - **Defection Trigger:** If in the previous round, fewer than half cooperated OR the stock has dropped below 50%, switch to Defecting for up to two rounds or until cooperation resumes and the stock recovers.
   
3. **Last Round:**
   - Always Defect (D) as there is no future stock to preserve.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Stock Near Depletion:** If the stock drops below 20% of capacity, defect in subsequent rounds to prevent further depletion while maximizing immediate gain.
- **High Cooperation:** If cooperation levels remain high (more than half), continue cooperating to maintain a sustainable stock.

### Adaptive Mechanism:
- Monitor the number of defectors and stock level each round.
- Adjust strategy based on recent history to balance collective good with individual payoff maximization.

This strategy aims to be robust against various opponent behaviors, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to protect individual interests.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **If the current stock is below 50% of capacity**, choose to Cooperate (C) to help replenish the stock.

This strategy balances the need to maintain a sustainable stock level with a responsive punishment mechanism to deter overexploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_452 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can employ an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observable metrics. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock and Round Considerations

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Building trust and preserving the stock for future rounds by maximizing regeneration opportunities.

2. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - **Threshold:** 50% of capacity.
     - If stock is above this threshold, continue cooperating.
     - If stock drops below, switch to defection temporarily (next round) to manage over-depletion risks.

3. **Round Progression Consideration:**
   - **Remaining Rounds:** Assess the number of rounds left.
     - In early rounds (more than half remaining), cooperate to allow stock regeneration.
     - In later rounds (less than half remaining), shift towards defection to maximize payoffs while ensuring stock isn't overly depleted.

4. **Payoff Trend Analysis:**
   - Monitor the average payoff per player over recent rounds.
     - If there's a significant decline, indicating potential over-harvesting by others, switch to defection for a round to protect individual interests.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Cooperate if stock is above 50% capacity; otherwise, defect to maximize final payoff.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If stock is critically low (e.g., below 20% of capacity), cooperate to allow regeneration for subsequent rounds.

6. **Tit-for-Tat Mechanism:**
   - Track the number of players who defected in previous rounds.
     - If a significant portion defected, defect in the current round as a punitive measure to deter exploitation.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(player_id, n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    remaining_rounds = r - current_round

    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate average stock over last few rounds (e.g., last 3)
    avg_stock_last_3 = sum([h['stock_after'] for h in history[-3:]]) / len(history[-3:])
    
    # Determine threshold based on capacity
    stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if stock > stock_threshold and remaining_rounds > (r // 2):
        return "C"
    elif avg_stock_last_3 < stock_threshold:
        return "D"
    else:
        # Check number of defectors in last round
        if len([h for h in history[-1:][0]['actions'] if h == 'D']) > (n // 2):
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

    # Handle edge cases in last rounds
    if current_round >= r - 1:
        if stock <= stock_threshold:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to establish a sustainable resource base.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Uses a threshold to decide when to switch strategies, preventing over-depletion.
- **Round-Based Adjustment:** Considers remaining rounds to balance conservation and payoff maximization.
- **Punitive Measures:** Incorporates a tit-for-tat approach to deter excessive defection by others.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Adjusts behavior in final rounds to either conserve or maximize payoffs based on stock levels.

This strategy aims to sustain the resource while allowing for strategic adjustments to maintain individual payoffs, promoting both collective and self-interest.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_453 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock is above two-thirds of capacity, cooperate if at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Low Stock Response:** If the stock drops below one-third of capacity or fewer than half of the players cooperated last round, defect to secure personal gain and deter others from overexploiting.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final three rounds, switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoffs since future stock preservation is no longer a concern.

4. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Track the number of cooperators versus defectors in recent history (e.g., past five rounds).
   - If fewer than half cooperated, defect for one round as punishment, then revert to cooperation if others return to cooperating.
   - After punishing, monitor subsequent behavior and adjust accordingly.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the stock is near zero, defect as preservation is no longer feasible.
   - Adjust thresholds (e.g., two-thirds and one-third) based on observed game dynamics and sensitivity of stock growth.

6. **Adaptation:** Use a moving average of past cooperation rates to smooth out temporary fluctuations and make decisions more stable.

This strategy balances cooperation with self-interest, adapting dynamically based on the game's state and others' behavior to sustain resources while maximizing personal gain when necessary.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Based Triggers (ACST)

**Objective:** Maximize individual and collective payoffs by balancing cooperation and defection based on observed stock dynamics and historical performance.

---

#### **1. Decision Rules**

- **First Round (t=1):** Cooperate unconditionally to initiate sustainable resource use.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
  - **Monitor Stock Trend:** Calculate the average stock level over the past three rounds (k=3). If the current average is less than the previous average, it indicates a decreasing trend.
    - **If Decreasing Trend:** Defect to secure higher payoffs before potential depletion.
    - **Else:** Cooperate to maintain or increase stock levels.

- **Punishment Mechanism:**
  - Track the average payoff over the last three rounds. If this average drops below 75% of the maximum possible payoff (when all cooperate), defect in the next round as retaliation.

---

#### **2. Edge Cases Handling**

- **Last Round:** Cooperate to ensure stock sustainability beyond the current game, promoting a positive final state.
  
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock after growth is below 50% of capacity, switch to Cooperation temporarily (e.g., one round) to allow recovery.

---

#### **3. Collective Alignment**

All players follow ACST independently, ensuring symmetry without need for communication. The strategy encourages cooperation unless retaliation or stock recovery necessitates defection.

elif stock_after_growth < capacity * 0.5:  # Low stock recovery
    action = "C"
else:
    action = acst_strategy(n, capacity, r, history)
```

---

### Explanation

- **Decision Making:** The strategy starts with cooperation and adapts based on observed trends in stock levels and historical payoffs. It defects if the stock is depleting or if payoffs are unsatisfactory, promoting a balance between sustainability and self-interest.

- **Edge Cases:** Special handling ensures responsible behavior in critical situations like the final round and when stock levels are dangerously low.

- **Collective Mindset:** By mirroring actions based on shared observables (stock levels and payoffs), players maintain alignment without coordination, fostering resilience against diverse opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_455 = '''
To address the problem of determining whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D) in each round of a repeated game, we need a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the resource (stock). The strategy should be robust across various numbers of players (n) and rounds (r), considering both reciprocity and resource management.

### Approach
1. **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a norm of cooperation.
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - If the current stock is below a threshold (e.g., half of the maximum capacity), choose C to allow replenishment.
   - Otherwise, examine the number of defectors in previous rounds. If more than a certain percentage (e.g., 25%) defected, choose D to punish free-riders.
   - If fewer defected, continue cooperating by choosing C.
3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

This strategy encourages cooperation while deterring exploitation and adapts based on the stock's health and others' past actions.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, previous_actions):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        # Defect in the last round to maximize immediate payoff
        return 'D'
    else:
        stock_threshold = capacity / 2
        if current_stock < stock_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            defectors = previous_actions.count('D')
            threshold_percentage = 0.25  # 25% of players
            if defectors > threshold_percentage * len(previous_actions):
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **First Round**: The strategy starts with cooperation to set a positive tone.
- **Middle Rounds**: It balances between maintaining the stock and responding to others' actions. If the stock is low, it prioritizes replenishment. Otherwise, it defects if many players defected before, preventing exploitation.
- **Last Round**: Without future consequences, defecting maximizes immediate gain.

This approach ensures sustainability while being responsive to other players' behavior, making it both cooperative and strategic.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_456 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining sustainable consumption in a common-pool resource game, we propose a strategy where each player acts based on the previous round's outcomes. The goal is to balance individual gain with collective sustainability by punishing overconsumption collectively.

### Strategy:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C). All players start by contributing to the public good.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the total consumption from the previous round.
   - If this total exceeds half of the stock available in that round, each player defects (D) in the current round as a form of punishment.
   - Otherwise, continue cooperating.

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Everyone starts by contributing, ensuring initial resource growth.
- **Monitoring Consumption:** After the first round, players check if the total consumption was sustainable. If it wasn't, they collectively defect to signal dissatisfaction and enforce better behavior.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** Defecting reduces individual contributions, incentivizing others to avoid overconsumption in future rounds.

### Outcome:
This strategy encourages sustainable use by penalizing overexploitation. While it may lead to temporary depletion if overconsumption occurs, it serves as a deterrent against excessive use, aiming for long-term resource preservation.

**Answer:** The optimal strategy is to cooperate in the first round and then defect in subsequent rounds whenever the total consumption exceeds half of the previous stock. This balances individual gain with collective sustainability through a simple punishment mechanism.

To address the challenge of maintaining a common resource in a non-cooperative game, we can design a simple yet effective deterministic strategy based on observing the previous round's stock level. This strategy ensures cooperation when the resource is plentiful and switches to defection when it becomes scarce.

**Strategy:**

1. **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** 
   - If the stock at the end of the previous round was above 50% of capacity, continue to Cooperate.
   - If the stock fell below 50%, switch to Defecting in the current round.

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation when Stock is High (≥50%):** By cooperating, players help maintain or increase the stock level, ensuring long-term sustainability and maximizing future payoffs.
- **Defection when Stock is Low (<50%):** Once the stock significantly depletes, defecting allows players to secure higher individual payoffs before the resource is exhausted further.

This strategy balances collective interest with individual self-interest, providing a clear rule based on observable conditions.

**Rationale:**
- **Cooperating when \( S > C/2 \):** This ensures that the stock remains high, allowing for sustainable consumption and maintaining higher future payoffs.
- **Defecting when \( S \leq C/2 \):** If the stock is low, defecting allows the player to maximize their immediate payoff while contributing to stock recovery through increased regeneration in subsequent rounds.

This strategy aims to balance individual gain with collective sustainability, ensuring that the player maximizes their payoffs over the game's duration.

1. **Initial Setup:** 
   - The game is played over `r` rounds.
   - Each player observes the current stock level, `S_t`, in round `t`.
   - The stock has a maximum capacity, `C`.

2. **Strategy Parameters:**
   - A threshold of 75% of the capacity (`0.75*C`) is set to determine the action for each round.
   - The last round (`r`) is treated specially.

3. **Decision Making in Each Round:**

   a. **Final Round (t = r):** 
      - Always choose to Defect, as there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for.

   b. **Non-Final Rounds (t < r):**
      - If the current stock level `S_t` is greater than 75% of capacity (`0.75*C`), Cooperate.
      - If `S_t` is less than or equal to 75% of capacity, Defect.

4. **Rationale:**

   - **Cooperating when `S_t > 0.75*C`:** This helps maintain a high stock level, ensuring sustainability and allowing for maximum future payoffs.
   - **Defecting when `S_t ≤ 0.75*C`:** Protects against being exploited by others who may be defecting, securing a higher immediate payoff before the stock depletes further.
   - **Always Defecting in the Last Round:** Maximizes immediate gain since there are no future consequences to consider.

This strategy encourages cooperation when the resource is plentiful but switches to self-interested defection when necessary, preventing excessive depletion and maintaining a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.

**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Objective**: Maximize collective payoff while ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource through an adaptive approach.

2. **Strategy Overview**:
   - The strategy is designed to balance immediate gains with future sustainability by adapting to both stock levels and players' past actions.
   - It incorporates cooperation, monitored responses to defection, stock-based thresholds, a forgiving tit-for-tat mechanism, and handling of edge cases like the first and last rounds.

3. **Detailed Strategy**:

   a. **Initial Rounds**:
      - Cooperate in the first few rounds (e.g., first 2-3 rounds) to gather information on others' behavior and maintain a high initial stock level.

   b. **Monitoring and Response**:
      - Track the number of defectors each round.
      - If the number of defectors exceeds half the players (n/2), switch to defecting for the next few rounds (e.g., 2-3 rounds) to prevent overexploitation.

   c. **Stock Thresholds**:
      - If the stock level falls below a threshold (e.g., capacity/2), cooperate to allow recovery.
      - When the stock is near capacity, tolerate some defection without risking depletion.

   d. **Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness**:
      - Mirror others' behavior but include a forgiveness mechanism. Forgive after a few rounds if cooperation resumes to avoid endless defection cycles.

   e. **Last Round Handling**:
      - Defect in the final round as there’s no future stock to protect, maximizing immediate payoff without sustainability concerns.

4. **Edge Cases and Considerations**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline and gather initial data.
   - **Low Stock Levels**: Prioritize cooperation when stock is low to facilitate recovery.
   - **High Defection Scenarios**: Adapt by defecting if others frequently defect, to avoid being exploited.

5. **Mechanism for Forgiveness**:
   - After detecting sustained cooperation from others, gradually revert to cooperating, encouraging mutual benefit.

6. **Implementation**:
   - Use a threshold-based system in the algorithm to determine actions based on stock levels and historical defection rates.
   - Incorporate counters to track recent defections and time since last cooperation to guide decisions.

This strategy aims to be robust against various behaviors, promoting sustainability while allowing for strategic defection when necessary.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_461 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold and Historical Feedback**

1. **First Round Decision:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation sets a positive precedent and maximizes initial payoffs without depleting the stock excessively.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Strategy:**
   - **Stock Level Check:** Monitor the current stock level after each round.
     - If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, switch to defecting (D) in the next round to secure remaining resources.
   - **Historical Feedback:** Analyze the number of players who defected in previous rounds.
     - If a significant portion (e.g., more than half) defected, consider switching to defecting to avoid exploitation.

3. **Last Round Decision:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

4. **Cooperation Sustainability:**
   - If the majority of players cooperate historically and the stock remains above a sustainable threshold, continue cooperating to maintain resource health.

5. **Adaptive Thresholds:**
   - Adjust the stock threshold (e.g., 50%) based on observed behavior and game parameters to optimize sustainability and payoffs.

This strategy balances individual gain with collective resource management by adapting actions based on stock levels and historical player behavior, ensuring robustness against varying opponent strategies while promoting sustainable outcomes.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_462 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining cooperation while preventing exploitation in a repeated game with a shared resource, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy: Cooperate on Sustainable Outcomes (COSO)

1. **First Round**: Cooperate by choosing action C.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - After each round `t-1`, observe the stock level after growth, denoted as \( S_{t-1} \).
   - If \( S_{t-1} < C \) (where \( C \) is the capacity), then choose action D in round `t`.
   - If \( S_{t-1} = C \), continue to cooperate by choosing action C.

### Rationale:
- **Cooperation when Sustainable**: By cooperating, players ensure that the total consumption does not exceed half of the stock (\( S/2 \)), allowing growth to restore it to capacity.
- **Defection as Punishment**: If the stock falls below capacity, indicating excessive consumption (i.e., too many defections), players defect to protect their payoff and discipline defectors.
- **Observable Public Signal**: The stock level serves as a clear, observable indicator of collective behavior, guiding individual decisions without needing knowledge of others' actions.

### Summary:
Players cooperate unless the resource is overexploited, inferred from the stock level dropping below capacity. This strategy balances cooperation with reciprocal punishment to maintain resource sustainability and fairness.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_463 = '''
To address the challenge of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round without communication, we can design a responsive strategy based on observed stock levels and expected outcomes under full cooperation. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Retaliation

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize collective benefit from the start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (After Each Round t):**
   - **Step 1:** Compute the expected stock level \( S_{\text{next,expected}} \) if all players had Cooperated in round t.
     - Calculate \( S_{\text{after,expected}} = S_t / 2 \).
     - Compute growth: \( 2 \times (S_t / 2) \times (1 - (S_t / 2)/\text{capacity}) \).
     - Determine \( S_{\text{next,expected}} = \min(S_t / 2 + \text{growth}, \text{capacity}) \).

   - **Step 2:** Compare the actual stock level \( S_{t+1} \) with \( S_{\text{next,expected}} \).
     - If \( S_{t+1} < S_{\text{next,expected}} \), infer that some players Defected.
     - Else, assume cooperation is maintained.

   - **Step 3:** Decide the action for round t+1:
     - If \( S_{t+1} < S_{\text{next,expected}} \):
       - Choose to Defect in the next round as retaliation.
     - Otherwise:
       - Continue Cooperating.

### Considerations and Adjustments

- **Retaliation Mechanism:** To prevent mutual defection leading to rapid stock depletion, incorporate a forgiveness mechanism. For example, after retaliating for a set number of rounds or if the stock recovers above a certain threshold, revert to Cooperation.
  
- **Probabilistic Approach:** Introduce randomness in actions to avoid predictable patterns. For instance, when deciding to Defect, do so with a high probability rather than deterministically to allow some flexibility.

### Conclusion

This strategy encourages cooperation while retaliating against defection, aiming to maintain a balance that sustains stock levels and maximizes collective payoffs over time.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_464 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game where players can observe the stock level after each round, here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Monitoring

1. **Initial Rounds (Early Game):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to build trust and maintain a high stock level, which maximizes collective payoffs.

2. **Monitoring Phase:**
   - **Observation:** After each round, observe the stock level after consumption (S_remaining) and calculate the new stock level (S_next).
   - **Threshold Check:** Determine if S_next is below a predefined threshold relative to capacity (e.g., 50% of K). This indicates potential overconsumption.
   
3. **Adjustment Based on Stock Level:**
   - **If S_next ≥ Threshold:** Continue cooperating. The stock is being sustained, suggesting sufficient cooperation.
   - **If S_next < Threshold:** Switch to defecting. This prevents further depletion and secures personal gain as others may also be defecting.

4. **Endgame Strategy (Last Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect in the final rounds.
   - **Rationale:** With no future rounds to preserve, defecting maximizes immediate payoffs without concern for long-term consequences.

### Rationale and Considerations:

- **Cooperation in Early Stages:** Encourages a high stock level, benefiting all players.
- **Adaptive Adjustment:** Monitoring the stock allows the strategy to respond dynamically to collective actions, preventing depletion.
- **Endgame Defection:** Ensures personal gain when future rounds no longer matter.

This strategy balances cooperation for sustained benefits with timely defection to secure personal gains, adapting based on observable game state.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_465 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative foundation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Previous Actions:** Calculate the number of players who defected in the previous round (D_count).
     - If D_count ≤ n/4, continue to Cooperate.
     - If D_count > n/4, Defect this round as a punitive measure.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - After each round, assess the stock level after growth.
   - If the stock drops below 50% of capacity, switch to Cooperate in the next round to aid replenishment, regardless of previous defection counts.

4. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Evaluate overall cooperation throughout the game:
     - If most players have cooperated, choose Cooperate.
     - If there's significant past defection, Defect to maximize personal payoff.

**Decision Rules:**

- **Cooperate** if recent history shows minimal defection (≤25%) or if stock is low, needing replenishment.
- **Defect** if recent defection exceeds 25% or in the last round based on overall cooperation trends.

This strategy balances maintaining cooperation with strategic punishment and adaptive responses to stock levels.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_466 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone, encouraging others to reciprocate and preserves the stock for future rounds.
   - **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
     - Observe the number of players who defected in the previous round (D_count).
     - If D_count exceeds half the number of players (rounded appropriately) OR the current stock is below half of the capacity, choose to Defect (D). This punishes excessive exploitation and protects your share.
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C) to sustain the resource.
   - **Last Round (r)**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - The first round is handled by initiating cooperation.
   - The last round prioritizes immediate gain by defecting.
   - Stock thresholds and defection counts ensure the strategy adapts to prevent overexploitation while maintaining collective resource sustainability.

3. **Collective Alignment**:
   - The strategy promotes cooperation unless clear signs of exploitation (high defection or low stock) are detected, ensuring a balance between individual and collective interests.

This adaptive approach fosters cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation, making it robust across various opponent behaviors in the tournament.

description_COLLECTIVE_467 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining the resource while ensuring individual benefit, we can adopt a strategic approach that combines cooperation with targeted defection. This method is designed to be adaptive, responding to both the state of the shared resource and the actions of others.

### Strategic Approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - Begin by cooperating in the first round. This sets a cooperative tone and allows the resource to remain healthy initially.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Continue cooperation unless certain conditions are met that indicate overuse of the resource or excessive defection.
     - **Defection Triggered by Resource Health:**
       - If the current stock drops below 50% of its capacity, switch to defection. This action aims to secure personal gain before the resource depletes further.
     - **Punishment for Excessive Defection:**
       - Monitor the number of defectors in the previous round. If more than half of the players defected, defect in the current round as a punitive measure. This discourages others from free-riding and helps maintain cooperation.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - In the last round, always defect to maximize personal gain since there are no future consequences for resource depletion.

### Strategy Summary:

- **First Round:** Cooperate.
- **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
  - Defect if the stock is below 50% capacity or if more than half defected in the previous round.
  - Otherwise, cooperate.
- **Last Round (r):** Always defect.

This approach balances cooperation with necessary defection to maintain resource health while optimizing personal gain. It adapts based on observed actions and resource status, making it effective without requiring coordination among players.

**Strategy: Adaptive Stock Threshold (AST)**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to establish initial cooperation.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity and it's not the last round, Cooperate (C).
     - Otherwise, Defect (D).

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to maximize collective benefit.
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect to secure maximum immediate payoff.

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   - The strategy encourages cooperation when the stock is sufficient for future rounds, ensuring sustainability and maximizing long-term payoffs.
   - It adapts by switching to defection when the stock is low or in the final round, prioritizing individual gain when collective benefits are no longer sustainable.

**Pseudocode Explanation:**

```python
def adaptive_stock_threshold(n, capacity, remaining_rounds, current_stock):
    if remaining_rounds == 0:

    # Always defect in the last round
    if remaining_rounds == 1:

    if current_stock > 0.5 * capacity:
        return "C"
    else:

This strategy ensures that players cooperate to maintain the resource when possible and defect when necessary, balancing collective and individual interests effectively.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_469 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation sets a baseline of trust and observes other players' reactions.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:

   - Examine the previous round's actions. If more than half of the players defected in the last round, defect this round as a punitive measure. Otherwise, continue to cooperate.

3. **Last Round Action**: Always Defect (D). Since there are no future consequences beyond the final round, maximize immediate gain by taking a larger share.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic punishment and conservation, ensuring adaptability across varying opponent behaviors while maintaining robustness throughout the game's duration.

**Strategy: Adaptive Sustainability (AS)**

1. **Target Stock Level**: Aim to maintain the stock around 50% of capacity (S_target = capacity / 2).

3. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate average cooperation rate from previous round.
   - If stock > S_target and most players cooperated, some may Defect.
   - If stock < S_target or few cooperated, all should Cooperate to replenish.

**Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation (ARC)**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** If the stock is above 50% of capacity and fewer than half of the players defected in the previous round.
   - **Defect (D):** If the stock is below 50% or more than half defected previously.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
   - **Last Round:** Cooperate unless others have defected in previous rounds, then defect to maximize final payoff without future consequences.

3. **Collective Mindset:**
   - Encourages cooperation when possible and sustainable.
   - Uses defection strategically to punish exploitation and protect the stock for future rounds.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```

    else:
        previous_stock = history[-1].stock_after

To address the problem of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need an adaptive approach that balances individual payoffs with sustainable resource management. Here's the structured strategy:

### Collective Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Thresholds

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a high initial stock level.
- **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):** 
  - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity or more than half of the players defected in the previous round, Defect.
  - Otherwise, Cooperate.
- **Last Round (r):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without future consequences.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to maintain a high stock level for future rounds.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to defecting to secure payoffs before further depletion.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize final payoff as there are no subsequent rounds.

**3. Collective Alignment:**

To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can create an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on both the game's state and historical actions. The strategy aims to maintain a sustainable stock level while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate to establish trust and maximize initial stock growth.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Cooperate** if the stock after the previous round is above 50% of capacity and fewer than half of the players defected last round.
   - **Defect** otherwise, to protect individual payoff when cooperation seems insufficient or the stock is at risk.

2. For each subsequent round t from 2 to r:
   a. Calculate the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   b. Determine the stock level after the previous round.
   c. If the stock is above 50% capacity and fewer than half defected, Cooperate (C).
   d. Else, Defect (D).

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation when S > 50%**: This ensures that the resource remains sufficient for future rounds, promoting sustainability and maximizing long-term payoffs.
- **Defection when S ≤ 50%**: When the stock is depleted beyond half capacity, defecting helps secure immediate gains before potential depletion, preventing being exploited by others' defection.

     - If half or fewer cooperated, defect in the current round to avoid exploitation.
   - **Stock Level Threshold**: Monitor the current stock level.
     - If the stock is below 50% of capacity, switch to cooperation to facilitate stock replenishment, regardless of historical actions.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future consequences for stock depletion.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a foundation for a healthy stock level, encouraging sustainability.
- **Adaptive Response**: By adjusting based on the previous round's cooperation rate, the strategy discourages exploitation and maintains fairness.
- **Stock Conservation**: Intervening when stock levels are low ensures resource availability for future rounds, preventing premature depletion.
- **Final Round Optimization**: Defecting in the last round maximizes individual gain without long-term repercussions.

This strategy is robust against various behaviors, promoting cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation and ensuring resource conservation.

To address the challenge of sustaining the maximum stock level while maximizing individual payoffs in a repeated game scenario without communication, we propose the following strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating (choosing action C) in the first round to establish a high stock level.

2. **Monitor Stock Level**: After each round, observe whether the stock level has dropped below 50% of its capacity.

3. **Adjust Strategy Based on Threshold**:
   - If the stock level remains above 50% of capacity, continue cooperating (C).
   - If the stock level falls to or below 50%, switch to defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoffs while the stock is still sufficient.

4. **Re-evaluate in Subsequent Rounds**: Continue applying this rule in each subsequent round based on the current stock level relative to the 50% threshold.

This strategy aims to balance collective sustainability with individual gain by maintaining cooperation when the stock is healthy and defecting when it becomes scarce, thus preventing a complete depletion while allowing players to benefit when necessary.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish trust and maximize initial payoffs without depleting the stock excessively.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - If the current stock is above a sustainability threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), cooperate.
  - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to defecting to prevent further depletion and signal punishment to defectors.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **Last Round:** Assess opponents' actions; if many are defecting, defect to protect payoff. Otherwise, continue cooperating.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If stock is critically low (e.g., below 30% of capacity), defect to prevent collapse and maximize immediate gain.

#### 3. Collective Mindset:
The strategy aims to balance individual gain with collective sustainability. It fosters cooperation when beneficial but adapts to punish non-cooperative behavior, ensuring the resource's longevity for all players.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_punishment(current_stock, capacity, history, round_number, total_rounds):
    # Parameters
    sustainability_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    forgiveness_threshold = 0.6  # Proportion of previous rounds with cooperation
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Assess opponents' cooperation rate in the last round
    previous_cooperation_rate = count_cooperative_actions(history[-1]) / n
    
    if current_stock > sustainability_threshold and previous_cooperation_rate >= forgiveness_threshold:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

def count_cooperative_actions(previous_round_history):
    # Count how many players chose 'C' in the last round
    cooperative_count = sum(1 for action in previous_round_history if action == "C")
    return cooperative_count

# Example usage in a round:
current_stock = 80.0
capacity = 100.0
history = [["C", "C", "D"], ["C", "D", "D"]]
round_number = 3
total_rounds = 5

action = adaptive_cooperation_punishment(current_stock, capacity, history, round_number, total_rounds)
print("Action:", action)
```

This strategy encourages sustained cooperation while being robust against exploitation, ensuring the common pool resource remains viable for all players over multiple rounds.

To address the Tragedy of the Commons dilemma in a repeated game setting, we can implement a strategic approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observable state variables. Here's a structured solution:

### Strategic Approach:
1. **First Round Cooperation**: All players start by cooperating to maximize initial resource growth.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Cooperate** if both of the following conditions are met:
     - The current stock level is above 50% of the capacity.
     - More than half of the total rounds remain (i.e., remaining rounds > r/2).
   - **Defect** if either condition fails. This means defecting when the stock is depleted below 50% or in the latter half of the game.

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: By cooperating initially, players ensure the resource grows, maximizing future payoffs.
- **Adaptive Strategy**: As rounds progress and the game nears its end, players switch to defection to secure immediate gains, especially when the resource is diminished or few rounds remain.
- **Balance Between Short-Term and Long-Term Gains**: This strategy ensures that players benefit from sustained resource use while also capturing benefits from strategic defection as the game concludes.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Each player cooperates in the first round.
2. For each subsequent round, evaluate the current stock level and remaining rounds.
3. Cooperate if both conditions (stock above 50% and more than half rounds left) are satisfied; otherwise, defect.

This approach effectively manages the common resource, encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to optimize individual payoffs.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_482 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round of a common pool resource game, we can implement a strategy that balances maintaining the stock for future rounds with securing immediate payoffs. The strategy is based on observing the current state of the stock and making decisions accordingly.

### Strategy:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This ensures the maximum possible initial stock level, promoting future sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - After each round, observe the stock level after growth (S_prev).
   - If S_prev is greater than 50% of the capacity, continue to Cooperate (C) to maintain or grow the stock.
   - If S_prev drops to 50% or below, switch to Defecting (D) to secure your share before potential depletion.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation maximizes the initial stock level, which is crucial for long-term sustainability and higher payoffs in subsequent rounds.
- **Stock Level Threshold**: Using a 50% threshold ensures that players act to maintain the stock when it's still at a healthy level. If the stock drops too low, defecting becomes necessary to prevent losing out entirely as others may also start defecting.
- **Adaptation**: The strategy adapts based on the observed state of the system, making it responsive to changes without requiring complex calculations or coordination.

### Implementation:

Each player follows these rules independently each round:

1. **First Round**: Choose C.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate S_prev, the stock level after the previous round's growth.
   - If S_prev > 0.5 * capacity: Choose C.
   - Else: Choose D.

This approach provides a balanced strategy that considers both collective and individual interests, aiming to sustain the resource while protecting against over-depletion.

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance individual gain with collective resource preservation through adaptive cooperation and punishment mechanisms.

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial resource replenishment.
   - **Mirror Majority:** In subsequent rounds, mirror the majority action from the previous round. If most players cooperated, cooperate again; if most defected, defect this round.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** Implement a stock threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity). If the current stock falls below this threshold, switch to cooperation regardless of the majority's past actions to conserve and replenish the resource.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate unconditionally to initiate trust and observe others' responses.
   - **Last Round:** Continue with the established strategy unless the stock is critically low, in which case prioritize cooperation to avoid depletion.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - All players using this strategy align their actions based on shared information of past moves and current stock levels, fostering implicit coordination without direct communication.

This adaptive approach encourages sustained cooperation while allowing for flexible responses to environmental changes and opponents' behaviors, promoting long-term resource sustainability.

**Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocation with Stock Conservation (ARSC)**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and observe others' behavior.

2. **Reciprocation Mechanism**:
   - **Past Behavior**: Monitor the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - **Current Stock Level**: Assess the stock level relative to its capacity, with specific attention if it drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 50%).
   
3. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate** if fewer than half of the players defected last round and the stock is above the conservation threshold.
   - **Defect** if more than half defected or if the stock is below the threshold, indicating a need to conserve or adapt.

4. **Stock Conservation**:
   - If the stock falls below the threshold, prioritize cooperation to allow replenishment, even if others have defected previously.

5. **Gradual Punishment**: Implement a tit-for-tat approach, matching the rate of defection from previous rounds but avoiding excessive retaliation that could harm the stock's sustainability.

6. **Final Round Consideration**:
   - Encourage cooperation unless the stock is severely depleted, balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

This strategy aims to balance reciprocity with resource management, ensuring players adapt based on both others' actions and the stock's health, promoting a sustainable collective outcome.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_485 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection to sustain the stock while maximizing individual payoffs. The strategy is outlined as follows:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold-Based Defection (ACTBD)

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Initiates cooperation, building trust and setting a precedent for sustainable resource use.

2. **Middle Rounds (2 to r-1):**
   - **Decision Rule:** 
     - If the stock after the previous round's growth is above 50% of capacity, continue cooperating.
     - If it drops below this threshold, switch to defecting to protect individual payoffs and prevent further depletion.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximizes immediate payoff as there are no future rounds to consider.

### Key Features:
- **Adaptive Threshold:** Uses a dynamic threshold (50% of capacity) to determine when to switch strategies, ensuring flexibility based on the stock's state.
- **Sustainability Focus:** Prioritizes cooperation unless the stock is significantly depleted, promoting long-term resource availability.
- **Endgame Strategy:** In the final round, defecting ensures maximum individual gain without future consequences.

This strategy encourages initial cooperation, adapts to the stock's condition, and prioritizes self-interest in the endgame, providing a balanced approach for collective play.

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

The proposed strategy is an adaptive approach that balances individual gain with collective sustainability, ensuring the common pool resource remains viable over all rounds. It incorporates elements of reciprocity and stock management to handle various opponent behaviors effectively.

### 1. Decision Rules:

- **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This initializes trust and maximizes initial stock growth.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Calculate the average cooperation rate from previous rounds.
  - If the cooperation rate is above a threshold (e.g., 70%), cooperate; otherwise, defect.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

- **Last Round**: Continue using the same strategy unless the stock is critically low (e.g., below 20% of capacity), in which case switch to Cooperate to prevent depletion.
  
- **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 30%), temporarily switch to Cooperate for one round to allow replenishment.

### 3. Collective Alignment:

The strategy is designed to foster cooperation when there's a collective intent, while defecting when others exploit excessively. It encourages sustainability without requiring communication or coordination.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def common_pool_strategy Parameters(n, r, capacity):
    Initialize prev_coop_rate = 0.5  # Neutral start
    stock_history = [capacity]  # Initial state

    for each round from 1 to r:
        if first round:
            action = C
        else:
            prev_actions = get previous actions of all players
            prev_coop_rate = count of C in prev_actions / n
            
            if prev_coop_rate >= threshold:
                action = C
            else:
                action = D

            current_stock = stock_history[-1]
            if current_stock < critical_stock:
                action = C  # Temporarily cooperate to replenish

        take action and observe new state
        update stock_history with new stock level

    return total payoff
```

### Explanation:

- **Adaptive Cooperation**: The strategy starts cooperatively, then adapts based on collective past behavior. This encourages reciprocal cooperation.
  
- **Stock Management**: By monitoring stock levels, the strategy ensures resource sustainability, switching to cooperation when depletion is imminent.

This approach is robust against various strategies, promoting a balance between individual gain and collective resource management.

To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round based on observed outcomes, we can implement a **Grim Trigger** strategy. This approach involves cooperating initially but switching to defection upon detecting any deviation from expected cooperative behavior.

### Strategy Explanation:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round.
2. **Monitor Outcomes**: After each round, calculate the expected stock level if all participants had Cooperated.
3. **Detect Defection**: If the actual stock level is lower than the expected level under full cooperation, infer that at least one participant defected.
4. **Punish Defection**: Once a defection is detected, switch to permanent Defection in subsequent rounds.

This strategy ensures mutual cooperation as long as everyone adheres to it but punishes any deviation by switching to defection, thereby maintaining fairness and discouraging unilateral defection.

### Conclusion:
The optimal approach is to use the **Grim Trigger** strategy. Cooperate until evidence of defection (via stock level discrepancy) is observed, then Defect permanently thereafter.

To address the challenge of designing a robust collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can adopt an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic retaliation, ensuring long-term sustainability while protecting against exploitation.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish trust and maximize initial stock levels.

2. **Monitor and Adapt**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: Continuously monitor the current stock level relative to a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
   - **Sustainable Consumption**: If the stock is above the threshold and total consumption was sustainable, continue cooperating.
   - **Retaliation Mechanism**: If others defect, causing excessive consumption, retaliate by defecting for a set number of rounds to deter future defection.

3. **Forgiveness and Reconciliation**:
   - After retaliating, gradually return to cooperation if others resume cooperative behavior, allowing the stock to recover.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - **Last Round Strategy**: In the final round, decide actions based on previous cooperation levels; cooperate if others were largely cooperative, otherwise defect.
   - **Critical Stock Levels**: If the stock is critically low, switch to defection to secure immediate payoffs rather than risking complete depletion.

### Detailed Strategy:

- **Round 1**: Cooperate (C) to initiate trust and maintain high stock levels.
  
- **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
  - Calculate the average consumption per player from the previous round.
  - If the average was above a certain threshold (indicating excessive consumption), defect in the current round. Continue this retaliation for up to two rounds beyond the last observed defection.
  - After retaliatory defections, revert to cooperation if the stock begins to recover.

- **Final Round (Round r)**:
  - Cooperate if the average consumption in the previous round was below the threshold, indicating others' willingness to cooperate.
  - Defect if the average consumption was above the threshold or if the stock is critically low.

### Rationale:

This strategy encourages cooperation while incorporating mechanisms to deter and punish defection. By retaliating against excessive consumption, it maintains the health of the common resource. Forgiveness allows for recovery and renewed cooperation, preventing cycles of endless retaliation. Handling edge cases ensures that the strategy remains effective even in critical situations or the final stages of the game.

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def collective_strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        prev_stock = history['stock'][-1]
        threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        avg_consumption_prev = sum(history['consumptions'][-1]) / n
        
        if avg_consumption_prev > (prev_stock / (2*n)):
            # Retaliate for up to two rounds beyond last defection
            retaliate_rounds = history['retaliate_rounds']
            if retaliate_rounds < 2:
                return "D"
                retaliate_rounds += 1
        else:
            if prev_stock > threshold:
                return "C"
            else:
                # Stock is low, defect to secure payoff
                return "D"
                
    # Final round handling
    if current_round == r:
        if avg_consumption_prev <= (prev_stock / (2*n)):
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"

```

This strategy balances reciprocity with practical considerations for stock sustainability and adaptability, aiming to maximize each player's payoff while maintaining the resource for future rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_489 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a stable and high stock level in the game while maximizing individual payoffs, we propose a dynamic strategy that adapts based on the current stock level and recent trends. The strategy encourages cooperation when the stock is low to allow recovery and permits controlled defection when the stock is sufficiently high.

### Strategy:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate. This action sets an initial cooperative tone, allowing the stock to grow maximally from the start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Calculate the Average Stock Level**: Determine the average stock level over the past three rounds.
   - **Stock Level Check**: If the current stock level \( S_t \) is below 75% of the capacity or if the average stock level indicates a declining trend, Cooperate in the next round to help replenish the stock.
   - **Defection with Caution**: If \( S_t \) is above 75% of the capacity and there's no downward trend, Defect. However, defect in a controlled manner by estimating the impact on future stock levels to avoid excessive depletion.

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation ensures that the stock begins at its maximum potential, fostering an environment where others are incentivized to cooperate initially.
  
- **Adaptive Strategy Based on Stock Levels**: By monitoring the stock level and recent trends, players can dynamically adjust their strategy. Cooperating when the stock is low prevents it from depleting further, while controlled defection when the stock is high allows for personal gain without jeopardizing future sustainability.

- **Controlled Defection**: When choosing to defect, players consider the potential impact on the stock's growth in subsequent rounds. This involves estimating total consumption and ensuring that the remaining stock after this round can still grow sufficiently.

This approach balances individual gains with collective sustainability, aiming to maintain a healthy stock level for continued play.

- **Stock Trend Monitoring:** After each round, monitor the stock level and its trend over the past three rounds.
  - If the stock falls below 50% of capacity and is decreasing, switch to Defect (D) for the next two rounds as a punishment mechanism.
  - Return to Cooperate once the stock recovers above the threshold or shows an increasing trend.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Always cooperate to start on a cooperative note.
- **Last Round:** Anticipate potential defection by others, so defect in the last round if the stock is already low to maximize immediate payoff without future consequences.
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock reaches zero, continue defecting as cooperation yields nothing.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
- All players follow the same adaptive strategy based on shared observations of stock levels and history, ensuring coordinated behavior without communication.

**Objective:** Balance individual payoffs with collective sustainability by adapting actions based on stock levels and opponents' behavior.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

- **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline and maintain high stock levels.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - **Stock Monitoring**: Track the stock level after each round. If it drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to defecting.
  - **Opponent Behavior Analysis**: Count the number of defectors from the previous round. If this number exceeds a defection threshold (e.g., 30% of players), defect in the current round.
  
- **Adaptive Response**:
  - If either condition (low stock or high defection) is met, defect for one round as a punitive measure.
  - After defecting, revert to cooperation if the stock level recovers above the critical threshold and fewer than the threshold number of players defected.

- **Final Round Adjustment**: In the last round (round r), always choose to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future stock sustainability is no longer a concern.

---

### **2. Edge Cases Handling**

- **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C) to initiate cooperation and maintain the stock at its maximum level.
  
- **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) to secure the highest possible immediate payoff without regard for future stock levels.

---

### **3. Collective Alignment**

This strategy promotes collective well-being by:
- Encouraging initial cooperation to sustain high stock levels.
- Punishing defectors only when necessary, to maintain fairness and deter exploitation.
- Being transparent and consistent in its rules, fostering trust among players.

description_COLLECTIVE_492 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing individual gain with collective sustainability in a repeated game scenario, we can outline a strategic approach that adapts based on observed history. This strategy aims to maintain cooperation when beneficial while allowing for defection when necessary.

### Strategic Approach:

1. **First Round: Cooperate**
   - All players start by cooperating to establish a baseline of mutual benefit and resource sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds: Adaptive Decision-Making**
   - **Stock Health Check:** After each round, assess the stock level after growth. If it falls below 50% of the initial capacity, defect in the next round.
   - **Defection Threshold:** Monitor the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than 25% defected, defect in the next round to avoid being exploited.
   - **Continue Cooperation:** If neither condition is met, continue cooperating to maintain resource health and collective benefit.

### Rationale:

- **Stock Health Check:** Defecting when the stock is critically low prevents further depletion and encourages others to reassess their strategies.
- **Defection Threshold:** Addressing significant free-riding by defecting helps mitigate losses from others exploiting the system.
- **Maintaining Cooperation:** Sustains resource levels for future rounds, ensuring continued payoffs.

### Implementation:

Each player independently applies this strategy based on observed outcomes, fostering a dynamic where cooperation is the norm unless conditions indicate the need to adapt. This approach promotes sustainability while allowing flexibility in response to collective actions.

- **Last Round**: Defect to secure the highest possible immediate gain, as future consequences are irrelevant.
- **Middle Rounds**: 
  - If the stock is critically low, cooperate to aid recovery.
  - Punish excessive defection (more than half) by defecting, encouraging others to cooperate.
  - Cooperate when enough players previously cooperated, maintaining a balance for sustained resource management.

This strategy aims to maintain cooperation while adaptively addressing defectors and ensuring maximum payoff in the final round.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_496 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and the stage of the game. The strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors without relying on communication or coordination.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Level Trigger (ACST)

1. **First Round**:
   - Cooperate (C). This initiates the game with maximum collective cooperation, aiming for a high initial payoff and setting a cooperative tone.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to R-1)**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: Each player monitors the current stock level (S) after growth from the previous round.
     - If S is above 50% of the game's capacity, continue Cooperating (C). This encourages sustainability and maintains a high stock level for future rounds.
     - If S drops below or equals 50%, switch to Defecting (D). This response aims to reduce individual contribution to over-depletion while allowing the stock to recover in subsequent rounds.

3. **Last Round (Round R)**:
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate personal payoff, as there are no future rounds to consider post this decision.

### Rationale:

- **Stock-Level Trigger**: The strategy uses the stock level as a proxy for collective behavior. A drop below 50% capacity indicates overuse, prompting a shift towards self-interested actions to prevent further depletion.
- **Adaptability**: By responding to the stock's state, players dynamically adjust their strategy, promoting resilience against varying levels of cooperation and defection among participants.
- **Simplicity and Robustness**: The approach is straightforward, relying on observable game states rather than complex calculations or assumptions about others' strategies, ensuring effectiveness across diverse scenarios.

This strategy aims to balance individual self-interest with collective sustainability, adapting dynamically based on the game's progression and state.

description_COLLECTIVE_497 = '''
### Strategy: **Adaptive Collective Cooperation with Sustainability Thresholds (ACCS)**

This strategy balances individual payoff maximization with collective sustainability goals while remaining robust against diverse opponent behaviors.

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Always cooperate (C). This establishes a cooperative baseline and maximizes initial payoffs.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If the current stock level is above a **sustainability threshold** (defined as 75% of capacity), cooperate (C) to maintain resource health while earning stable payoffs.
  - If the stock level falls below this threshold, defect (D) to secure higher individual payoffs before the resource depletes further.
  - If the stock level drops below a **critical threshold** (25% of capacity), switch back to cooperation (C) to allow the resource to recover.

#### 2. Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Cooperate unconditionally to maximize initial collective payoff and set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Round**: Defect (D) if the stock is sufficient, as there's no future round to benefit from conservation. If the stock is low, cooperate to ensure resource availability for others if applicable.

#### 3. Collective Alignment:
This strategy promotes cooperation when sustainable but adapts to prevent overexploitation or exploitation by others. It aligns with collective goals by prioritizing resource sustainability while protecting individual payoffs when necessary.

### Pseudocode:
```
function decide_action(state, history):
    if state.round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    stock = state.stock
    capacity = game.capacity
    
    sustainability_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    critical_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    
    if stock > sustainability_threshold:
        return "C"
    elif stock < critical_threshold:
        return "C"
    else:
        previous_actions = history[-1].actions
        num_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == "D")
        
        if num_defectors > 0.5 * game.n:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

function calculate_payoff(stock, action):
    n = game.n
    if action == "C":
        return stock / (2 * n)
    else:
        return stock / n

# Example usage in a round:
current_stock = 100
action = decide_action(current_state, game_history)
payoff = calculate_payoff(current_stock, action)
```

### Explanation:
- **Sustainability Focus**: The strategy prioritizes maintaining the resource above 75% of capacity to ensure long-term playability.
- **Adaptive Response**: It adapts by defecting when the stock is between 25%-75%, balancing individual gain with collective sustainability.
- **Critical Conservation**: Below 25%, cooperation resumes to prevent irreversible depletion.

This approach ensures that players act collectively to preserve the resource while protecting their interests, making it robust against various strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_498 = '''
To address the problem of designing a cooperative strategy that promotes sustainable resource management in a repeated game scenario, we can outline an approach based on observed behavior and resource health. Here's how the strategy could be structured:

### Strategy Outline:
1. **First Round Cooperation**: All players cooperate in the first round to establish trust and maximize initial resource utilization without depletion.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Health Check**: Players evaluate whether the current stock is above a predetermined threshold, such as 50% of the maximum capacity.
   - **Cooperation History Review**: Each player reviews the number of cooperators in the previous round relative to the total number of players (e.g., at least half).
3. **Decision Making**:
   - If both conditions are met (stock above threshold and sufficient cooperation), the player continues to cooperate.
   - Otherwise, the player defects to either conserve resources or signal dissatisfaction with insufficient prior cooperation.

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and ensures that the resource isn't immediately over-exploited.
- **Stock Health Indicator**: Monitoring the stock level helps in determining whether past actions have been sustainable. A threshold like 50% provides a clear, measurable target.
- **Social Feedback Mechanism**: By considering previous cooperation levels, players can incentivize others to maintain cooperative behavior, fostering mutual trust and resource preservation.

### Example Implementation:
```python
def strategy(current_stock, capacity, prev_cooperations, n_players):
    # Define the threshold for stock level (50%)
    stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > stock_threshold and (prev_cooperations / n_players) >= 0.5:
        return "COOPERATE"
    else:
        return "DEFECT"
```

### Explanation:
- **First Round**: Everyone cooperates.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If the resource is healthy (above 50%) and enough players cooperated previously, continue cooperating.
  - If either condition isn't met, defect to signal or conserve.

This approach balances punishment for over-exploitation with incentives for continued cooperation when conditions are favorable.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_499 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Management (ACSM)**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Rounds:** Cooperate (C) in the first few rounds to establish a pattern of cooperation and allow the stock to grow or maintain its level.
   - **Monitor Consumption:** Track the total consumption per round relative to the cooperative share (stock/(2n)). If the average consumption exceeds this threshold, indicating potential over-harvesting by others, switch to Defect (D) in subsequent rounds.
   - **Stock Level Check:** Continuously assess the stock level. If it falls below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), revert to cooperation to facilitate recovery and prevent depletion.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to initiate stock growth and set a cooperative precedent.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.
   - **Stock at Capacity or Depletion:** If the stock is at capacity, continue cooperating to maintain sustainability. If depleted (stock = 0), defect as cooperation yields no benefit.

3. **Collective Alignment:**
   - Encourage cooperation when possible to sustain the resource for all players.
   - Adapt strategies based on collective actions and stock dynamics to balance individual payoffs with long-term sustainability.

This strategy promotes initial cooperation, adapts based on others' behavior, and manages the stock prudently to ensure maximum total payoff while maintaining the resource for future rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_500 = '''
To address the problem of encouraging cooperation while maximizing payoffs in a repeated game scenario with perfect information, we can adopt a threshold-based strategy. This approach conditions each player's action on the collective behavior observed in previous rounds. Here's a structured strategy:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This initializes the game with maximum stock and encourages others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - After each round, every player examines how many players defected in the previous round.
   - If fewer than 50% of the players defected last round, continue to Cooperate.
   - If 50% or more defected, switch to Defecting this round.

This strategy promotes sustained cooperation when a majority are cooperative but adapts by defecting if widespread defection is observed. It balances reciprocity with self-interest, ensuring that each player's actions align with the collective behavior of others, thus maintaining a balance between immediate gains and future sustainability.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_501 = '''
To address the problem of determining when to cooperate or defect in a repeated game scenario, we can employ a strategy that balances cooperation with measured retaliation. The goal is to maintain a healthy stock level while being prepared to adapt if others defect.

### Strategy Overview
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial gains.
2. **Stock Level Monitoring**: After each subsequent round, monitor the stock level after growth. If it remains above a certain threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), continue cooperating. This encourages maintaining a high stock level collectively.
3. **Retaliation Mechanism**: If the stock level drops below the threshold, switch to defecting in the next rounds. This acts as a punishment mechanism to deter others from exploiting the system.
4. **Endgame Consideration**: In the final round, always defect to maximize immediate gain since there are no future consequences.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **First Round (t=1)**: Cooperate by choosing action C.
2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - After each round, observe the stock level after growth.
   - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, continue cooperating.
   - If it drops below this threshold, defect in the next round.
3. **Final Round (t=r)**: Always choose action D to maximize immediate gain.

### Rational
- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages a high starting stock level and sets a cooperative tone.
- **Stock Threshold**: The 75% threshold serves as an indicator of overall cooperation health, triggering retaliation only when necessary.
- **Retaliation**: Punishes defectors by reducing their potential gains in subsequent rounds if the stock is depleted.
- **Endgame Defection**: Maximizes personal gain without future repercussions.

This strategy ensures sustained cooperation while protecting against exploitation, balancing short-term and long-term interests effectively.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_502 = '''
**Collective Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Initial Cooperation (First k Rounds):**
- **Action:** Cooperate for the initial 5% of total rounds (k = r/20).
- **Rationale:** Establish a high stock level early on, encouraging others to follow suit and building a foundation for sustainable use.

**2. Monitoring Phase:**
- **Observation:** After the initial phase, monitor the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
- **Threshold Check:** If ≥80% of players (p*n) cooperated, continue cooperating.
- **Defection Response:** If <80%, trigger a punishment phase.

**3. Punishment Phase:**
- **Duration:** Defect for m rounds (e.g., 5 rounds).
- **Objective:** Reduce personal consumption to signal disapproval and encourage defectors to reconsider their strategy.

**4. Recovery Check:**
- **Post-Punishment Evaluation:** After m rounds, assess if enough players have resumed cooperation.
- **Resume Cooperation:** If ≥80% are cooperating again, revert to cooperative actions.
- **Adjust Strategy:** If not, consider extending punishment or adjusting thresholds to prevent stock depletion.

**5. Stock Conservation Mechanism:**
- **Threshold Trigger:** If stock drops below 20% of capacity, prioritize cooperation for a set period (e.g., 10 rounds) to allow regrowth.
- **Prevent Collapse:** This ensures the resource isn't exhausted, maintaining future payoffs even if others defect.

**6. Endgame Strategy:**
- **Final Rounds (Last 5%):** Switch to defection to maximize personal gain, as there's no future punishment possible.
- **Consideration:** Balance immediate gain with potential stock crash, but prioritize self-interest in terminal stages.

**Parameters:**
- **k:** Initial cooperative rounds = r/20
- **p:** Cooperation threshold = 80%
- **m:** Punishment duration = 5 rounds

This strategy combines initial cooperation, reciprocal punishment, and adaptive conservation to sustain the resource while deterring defection. It's robust against various behaviors and aims for long-term mutual benefit through balanced incentives.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_503 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

1. **First Round Decision**: 
   - Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone, encouraging trust and sustainable resource use from the start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Cooperation Threshold**: If in the previous round all players cooperated and the stock is above 50% of capacity, continue cooperating.
   - **Punishment Mechanism**: If any player defected in the previous round, switch to Defect (D) for the next two rounds. This serves as a deterrent against defection without causing prolonged harm.

3. **Stock-Based Adjustment**:
   - **Low Stock Threshold**: If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, all players should cooperate regardless of past actions. This allows the resource to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability.

This strategy combines initial cooperation with a trigger-based punishment system and adaptive adjustments based on stock levels. It aims to maintain high payoffs while preserving the resource for future rounds, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_504 = '''
To address the problem of maintaining the common resource effectively, each player should employ a threshold-based strategy. They will cooperate as long as the current stock remains above 50% of its capacity. If it drops below this threshold, they will switch to defecting to maximize their immediate gains. This approach balances the need to preserve the resource with individual self-interest.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Observe Current Stock (S_t):** Each player first checks the current stock level.
2. **Compare to Threshold:** If S_t is above 50% of capacity, the player chooses to Cooperate (C). If S_t is at or below 50%, they choose to Defect (D).
3. **Act Accordingly:** Based on the decision from step 2, the player either cooperates or defects in that round.
4. **Repeat:** This process repeats every round, adjusting behavior based on the updated stock level.

**Answer:**

Each player should cooperate when the current stock exceeds 50% of its capacity and defect otherwise. Thus, the strategy is:

Cooperate if \( S_t > \frac{c}{2} \), else Defect.

To address the challenge of designing a collective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed an adaptive approach that balances individual incentives with long-term sustainability. The strategy encourages cooperation while being robust against exploitation by others.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** All players start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of trust and resource conservation.
2. **Monitor Consumption:** After each round, calculate the total consumption of resources. If this exceeds a sustainable threshold (e.g., more than half of the current stock), it indicates overexploitation.
3. **Adaptive Response:** Players switch to defecting if the previous round's consumption was unsustainable. This serves as a punitive measure against excessive exploitation.

### Detailed Strategy:
- **Round 1:** Cooperate to maximize initial resource conservation.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate total consumption from the previous round.
   - If consumption exceeds a sustainable level (e.g., more than half of the stock), defect in the current round.
   - Continue cooperating if consumption remains sustainable.

### Rationale:
This approach incentivizes cooperation by maintaining resource levels, while also penalizing overexploitation. It's simple, adaptive, and aligns individual actions with collective sustainability without requiring coordination.

     - If ≥75% cooperated, continue Cooperating.
     - If 50% ≤ cooperation <75%, alternate between C and D to encourage sustainability while protecting payoffs.
     - If <50% cooperated, Defect (D) to protect individual payoffs.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level relative to capacity.
   - If stock drops below 50% of capacity, switch to Cooperate (C) to facilitate recovery and sustainability.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final round, all players should Cooperate (C) to ensure the resource isn't over-exploited, maximizing long-term payoffs.

### Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Sustainability Thresholds (ARST)

1. **First Round Action**: 
   - **Cooperate (C)** to establish a cooperative baseline and encourage others to reciprocate.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - **Monitor Collective Consumption**: Each player calculates the total consumption in the previous round by comparing the stock before and after growth.
     - If `Total Consumption > Previous Stock / 2`, indicating excessive extraction beyond sustainable levels, choose **Defect (D)** as a punitive measure.
     - Otherwise, continue to **Cooperate (C)**.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Regardless of previous actions, always **Defect (D)** in the final round to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and encourages reciprocal behavior from other players.
- **Punishment Mechanism**: By defecting when collective consumption exceeds sustainable levels, this strategy discourages excessive exploitation and maintains resource availability for future rounds.

   - **Adaptive Thresholds:** Use a dynamic assessment based on stock trends. If depletion is evident despite cooperation, switch to defection.

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds dependent on the current stock level.

4. **Reciprocity Consideration:**

            return "D"
        
        prev_actions = history[-1]
        D_prev = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == "D")
        
        if D_prev > n / 2:
            return "D"
        
        else:
            # Calculate previous stock after consumption and growth
            S_remaining = calculate_stock_after_growth(history)
            
            if S_remaining < (capacity / 2):
                return "C"
            else:
                return "D"

def calculate_stock_after_growth(history):
    # Implement logic to compute S_remaining based on the game's stock dynamics
    pass
```

**Explanation:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish cooperation and maintain a sustainable resource level.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** Adjust actions based on previous defections. If many defected, defect to protect against exploitation. Otherwise, decide based on stock levels relative to half capacity to balance sustainability and payoff maximization.
- **Last Round:** Maximize immediate gain by defecting, as future rounds are not a concern.

This strategy adaptively responds to both the behavior of other players and the current state of the resource, ensuring robustness across various scenarios while exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs when possible.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_4 = '''
To maximize your payoff while considering future rounds, you should adopt a strategy based on the current stock level relative to its capacity. Cooperate when the stock is above 50% of its maximum capacity; defect once it falls below this threshold. This approach balances resource sustainability with personal gain.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Assess Current Stock Level:** Determine if the current stock (S) exceeds half of its maximum capacity.
2. **Choose Action Based on Threshold:**
   - If S > 50% of capacity, cooperate to sustain higher future payoffs.
   - If S ≤ 50%, defect to maximize immediate gain when resources are limited.

**Answer:** 
You should cooperate when the stock is above 50% of its maximum capacity and switch to defecting once it falls below that threshold.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_5 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we'll employ an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation and defection while ensuring long-term resource sustainability. This approach is designed to exploit opportunities for higher payoffs while maintaining the stock for future rounds.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability Checks

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' actions without immediately exploiting.

2. **Reciprocal Behavior:**
   - In subsequent rounds, base your action on the majority behavior from the previous round.
     - If most players cooperated, defect to exploit the higher stock level for personal gain.
     - If many defected, cooperate to help replenish the stock and encourage a return to cooperation.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - Continuously monitor the current stock level. If it drops below 50% of capacity, switch to cooperation to prevent depletion, regardless of others' actions.
   - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, defect to maximize immediate gains, as the resource can sustain higher consumption.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final round (r), always defect to maximize your payoff since there's no future stock to preserve.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate unconditionally to set a cooperative tone and gather initial data on others' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the number of defectors in the previous round.
     - If more than half defected, cooperate to help replenish the stock.
     - If half or fewer defected, defect to exploit the resource for higher personal gain.
   - Check the current stock level:
     - If stock ≤ 50% of capacity, switch to cooperation regardless of others' actions to prevent depletion.
     - If stock ≥ 75% of capacity, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Final Round (r):**
   - Always defect to secure the maximum possible payoff in the last round without concern for future stock levels.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock'] if history else capacity

    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'  # First round: Cooperate

    previous_actions = [action['player_i'] for action in history[-1]]
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')

    if len(history) == r - 1:
        return 'D'  # Last round: Defect

    if current_stock <= capacity * 0.5:
        return 'C'
    elif current_stock >= capacity * 0.75:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if num_defectors > n / 2:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

# Example usage
n = 4
r = 10
capacity = 100

history = []  # Initially empty
action = strategy(n, r, capacity, history)
print(action)  # Should print 'C' for the first round

# After first round, update history with stock and actions
history.append({'stock': new_stock, 'players': ['C', 'D', 'C', 'D']})
```

### Strategy Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to encourage others and gather initial data.
- **Reciprocal Behavior:** Adapts based on previous actions, defecting when safe to exploit higher gains.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Ensures sustainability by switching to cooperation if the stock is low, preventing depletion.
- **Endgame Defection:** Maximizes payoff in the final round without concern for future consequences.

This strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term resource management, ensuring competitive performance against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_6 = '''
To address the problem of designing a strategic approach for the Common Pool Resource game, we propose an adaptive strategy that balances exploitation with sustainability. Here's the structured plan:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy is named "Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability" (AES). It starts cooperatively, monitors the stock level and opponents' actions, and adapts accordingly to maximize long-term payoffs while maintaining resource viability.

### Key Components of AES:

1. **Initial Rounds Strategy**:
   - In the first round, cooperate to observe others' behavior without depleting the stock excessively.
   
2. **Stock Level Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitor the current stock level after each round. If it drops below 50% of capacity, switch to defecting until recovery.

3. **Response to Opponents' Actions**:
   - Track the number of defectors from the previous round. If more than half defected, switch to defecting in the next round to protect your share.
   
4. **Future Consideration**:
   - Avoid defecting in the last round if the stock is healthy to ensure sustainability for others, promoting a balanced endgame.

5. **Adaptive Cooperation Rate**:
   - Adjust cooperation based on a moving average of past outcomes. If recent rounds show high defection, increase defection; otherwise, revert to cooperation.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If stock is below 50% of capacity: Defect.
   - Else if more than half defected last round: Defect.
   - Otherwise: Cooperate.
3. **Last Round (r)**: 
   - If stock is above 50%, cooperate; else, defect.

### Pseudocode:

```
function strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = get_current_round()
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        previous_stock = history["stock_after"][current_round - 2]
        defectors_last = count_defectors(history["actions"][current_round - 1])
        
        if (previous_stock < capacity * 0.5):
            return "D"
        elif (defectors_last > n / 2):
            return "D"
        else:
            if current_round == r and previous_stock >= capacity * 0.5:
                return "C"
            else:
                return "C" if random() < 0.1 else "D"

    return "D"  # default case
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to avoid immediate depletion.
- **Stock Threshold**: Defects when stock is critically low to prevent further harm.
- **Retaliation Mechanism**: Defects if many others defected previously, discouraging exploitation.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Cooperates in the last round if sustainable, ensuring fair play.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to the game's state and opponents' behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_7 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we aim to maximize individual payoffs by adapting actions based on the game's state and history. The strategy focuses on sustaining the stock when beneficial but switching to defecting when others deplete it or in the final round.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C). This helps maintain a high stock level for future rounds, maximizing potential payoffs.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Until Last Round)**:
   - Observe the stock level after each round.
   - If the new stock is less than the previous round's starting stock, switch to Defect (D) in the next round. This indicates others are defecting, making it beneficial to extract more before depletion.
   - Continue Cooperating if the stock remains stable or grows, as this sustains resource availability.

3. **Last Round Action**: Always Defect (D). Since there's no future round, prioritize immediate gain by extracting the maximum possible from the current stock.

**Rationale**:
- **Cooperation Initially**: Maintains a high stock level, ensuring higher payoffs in subsequent rounds.
- **Adaptive Switching**: Detects when others' defection reduces the stock and responds by defecting to capture more value before depletion accelerates.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Cooperate in the first round.
2. For each subsequent round, compare the current stock with the previous round's starting stock.
3. If the stock has decreased, defect in the next round; otherwise, continue cooperating.
4. In the final round, always choose to defect to maximize immediate gain.

This strategy effectively balances between sustaining the resource and exploiting it when others' actions or the game's end justify doing so.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_8 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability (AES)**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to observe others' initial moves without immediate exploitation.
   - **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
     - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect (D) this round.
     - Otherwise, cooperate (C).
     - If the current stock level is below capacity/2, switch to cooperation regardless of others' past actions to help replenish the stock.
   - **Last Round (r):** Always defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as future rounds do not matter.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, cooperate to gauge other players' behavior and set a baseline for future decisions.
   - In the last round, prioritize immediate gain by defecting, ensuring maximum payoff without concern for stock depletion in subsequent rounds.
   - When the stock is low (below capacity/2), cooperate to conserve resources, even if others are defecting, to maintain a sustainable stock for potential future exploitation.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - Exploit opponents' past defections by defecting when the majority has defected previously, capitalizing on their over-consumption.
   - Maintain cooperation when others cooperate to sustain stock levels, ensuring continued resource availability for future rounds.
   - Adjust strategy based on current stock levels to prevent depletion, thereby preserving the resource for sustained exploitation.

This strategy adaptively balances exploiting opponents' actions and conserving resources, ensuring both immediate gains and long-term sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_9 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Start by cooperating to observe others' initial behavior without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Decision Rules:**
     - **Count Past Defections:** Observe the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     - **Stock Threshold Check:** Determine if the current stock is below a certain threshold, e.g., capacity/2.
     - **Strategy Adjustment:**
       - If more than half of the players defected last round or if the current stock is below the threshold, switch to Defect (D).
       - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

4. **Adaptive Considerations:**
   - **Stock Management:** Balance between exploiting high stock levels with defection and maintaining cooperation when the stock is sustainably managed.
   - **Growth Dynamics:** Recognize that lower stock levels can still recover well due to the growth function, but defecting may secure higher immediate payoffs.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```python
def exploitative_strategy(n, capacity, r):
    # Initialize strategy and past defections tracking
    strategy = "C"
    past_defections = []
    
    for round in range(1, r + 1):
        if round == 1:
            action = "C"
        else:
            count_defections = sum(past_defections)
            current_stock = get_current_stock()
            
            if (count_defections > n / 2) or (current_stock < capacity / 2):
                action = "D"
            else:
                action = "C"
                
            # Track defections for next round
            past_defections.append(1 if action == "D" else 0)
            
        if round == r:
            action = "D"
            
        take_action(action)

This strategy adaptively switches between cooperation and defection based on historical behavior and stock levels, aiming to exploit opponents' actions while managing the resource sustainably for future rounds.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_10 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can employ an adaptive approach that considers both historical actions and the current state of the stock. This strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection to maximize payoffs while maintaining the sustainability of the resource.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Consideration

1. **Initialization:**
   - Track the number of players, n.
   - Monitor the stock level at each round.
   - Keep a history of previous actions (number of defectors in each round).

2. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets a positive tone and encourages potential cooperation from others.

3. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the average number of defectors over the past few rounds.
   - Assess the stock trend: Determine if the stock is increasing, stable, or decreasing.
   
   - If the average number of defectors is high (e.g., above 30%) and the stock is declining:
     - Defect (D) to secure a higher payoff before the stock depletes further.
   - If the stock is stable or increasing despite some defection:
     - Cooperate (C) to sustain resource regeneration.

4. **Last Round:**
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as future consequences are irrelevant.

5. **Stock Trend Calculation:**
   - Compare the current stock level with previous rounds.
   - If the stock is consistently decreasing, adjust towards defection.
   - If the stock is stable or increasing, maintain cooperation.

6. **Adaptive Threshold:**
   - Use a dynamic threshold for defection based on stock health and historical defection rates.
   - Adjust the threshold to balance between exploiting current gains and preserving future resources.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, history, round_num, total_rounds):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        avg_defectors = sum(history) / len(history)
        stock_trend = get_stock_trend(current_stock, previous_stocks)
        
        if avg_defectors > 0.3 and stock_trend == "declining":
            return "D"
        elif round_num == total_rounds:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

def get_stock_trend(current_stock, previous_stocks):
    # Implement logic to determine trend
    pass
```

### Rationale:

- **Cooperation in the First Round:** Encourages initial trust and potential reciprocity.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Adjusts behavior based on collective past actions and stock health, promoting sustainability when possible.
- **Defection in Critical Situations:** Prevents significant loss by defecting when the stock is at risk of depletion.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** Maximizes immediate gain without regard for future consequences.

This strategy balances exploitation with resource preservation, adapting to the dynamics of the game to optimize long-term payoffs.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation for Common Pool Resource Game

**Objective:** To maximize total payoff by balancing cooperation and defection based on opponents' behavior and resource sustainability.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate (C) to observe others' actions and maintain a high stock level.

2. **Monitor and Adapt:**
   - After each round, calculate the number of players who Defected (D_prev).
   - Track the average number of defectors over past rounds.
   - If D_prev exceeds 50% of total players or the current stock drops below 50% of capacity, switch to Defect (D) in the next round.

3. **Late Game Defection:**
   - In the last two rounds, always choose Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs regardless of others' actions.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, remaining_rounds):
    # Initialize variables
    total_defectors = 0
    current_stock = capacity
    action_history = []
    
    for round in range(1, r+1):
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
            payoff = current_stock / (2 * n)
            # Record action and update state
        else:
            prev_defectors = count_defectors(action_history[-1])
            avg_defectors = total_defectors / (round - 1)
            
            if prev_defectors > n/2 or current_stock < capacity * 0.5:
                action = 'D'
                payoff = current_stock / n
            else:
                action = 'C'
                payoff = current_stock / (2 * n)
            
            # Update state based on all actions
            total_consumption = sum of individual consumptions
            new_stock = update_stock(current_stock, total_consumption)
            current_stock = new_stock
            
        if round > r - 2:
            action = 'D'
            payoff = current_stock / n
        
        action_history.append(action)
        total_defectors += (1 if action == 'D' else 0)
    
    return sum of all payoffs
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to set a high stock level and gauge others' strategies.
- **Adaptive Response:** Monitors past defections and current stock, adapting by defecting if exploitation is detected or sustainability is at risk.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Ensures maximum payoff extraction in final rounds, acknowledging the game's end.

This strategy effectively balances cooperation with strategic defection, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while aiming to maximize overall payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_12 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets a baseline of cooperation and observes how other players respond.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Past Cooperation Check:** Calculate the average cooperation rate from the previous round by dividing the number of players who chose C by the total number of players, n.
     - If the average cooperation rate is ≥ 0.5, proceed to check the stock level.
     - If the average cooperation rate is < 0.5, choose to Defect (D).
   - **Stock Level Evaluation:** Assess the current stock level relative to the capacity.
     - If the stock level is above half of the capacity and the average cooperation rate is sufficient, Cooperate (C).
     - If the stock level is below half of the capacity or the cooperation rate is low, Defect (D).

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds do not matter.

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation encourages others to reciprocate and builds a sustainable resource base.
- **Adaptive Response:** By mirroring the majority's behavior, the strategy discourages excessive exploitation while allowing for strategic defection when necessary.
- **Stock Conservation:** Prioritizing stock level ensures that the resource remains viable for future rounds, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

This approach aims to exploit opportunities when others are not cooperating while maintaining the resource for continued play.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_13 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can outline a structured approach that balances immediate gain with long-term sustainability. This strategy is adaptive and robust, considering both the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Rounds (Early Game):**
   - **Cooperate:** Start by cooperating to encourage others to do the same, aiming to maintain a healthy stock level for future rounds.
   
2. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - **Threshold Check:** Continuously monitor the current stock level relative to the capacity.
     - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, defect to maximize immediate gain.
     - If the stock is below 25%, cooperate to conserve and allow regrowth.
     - For intermediate levels (25-75%), base the decision on the majority action in the previous round.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Track players who defected when the stock was low. In subsequent rounds, if a player defected excessively, switch to cooperation to "punish" them by reducing their potential overexploitation.

4. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - In the last round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and observe others' initial moves.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Evaluate the current stock level:
     - If stock > 75% of capacity, defect (D).
     - If stock < 25%, cooperate (C).
     - If between 25-75%, decide based on the majority action last round.
   - Implement punishment by cooperating if others defected excessively when stock was low.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Defect (D) to maximize personal gain as future consequences are irrelevant.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def strategy(stock, capacity, history, is_last_round):
    threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
    threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity

    if is_last_round:
        return "Defect"

    if stock > threshold_high:
        return "Defect"
    elif stock < threshold_low:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        # Determine majority action in previous round
        previous_actions = history[-1]
        count_d = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
        if count_d > len(previous_actions)/2:
            # Majority defected last time, cooperate to punish
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            # Previous round was balanced or cooperative, defect
            return "Defect"

    # Punish phase: check if others exploited when stock was low
    for i in range(len(history)):
        round_stock = history[i]['stock']
        if round_stock < threshold_low and history[i]['actions'].count('D') > 0:
            # Identify players who defected when stock was low
            # Cooperate to punish their excessive defection
            return "Cooperate"

    return "Defect"  # Fallback, though ideally covered by conditions above

# Example usage for each round:
# history keeps track of previous actions and stock levels
for round in range(r):
    current_stock = state['stock']
    if round == r-1:
        action = strategy(current_stock, capacity, history, True)
    else:
        action = strategy(current_stock, capacity, history, False)
    # Update history with current actions and new stock level
```

### Explanation:

This strategy dynamically adjusts based on the stock's health and opponents' behavior. By defecting when the stock is plentiful and cooperating to conserve or punish when it's low, the approach balances exploitation with sustainability. The punishment mechanism discourages excessive defection, promoting a more stable environment. In the final round, maximizing personal gain takes precedence, ensuring no opportunity is wasted. This balanced approach aims to outperform both overly cooperative and exploitative strategies in a competitive tournament setting.

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Start by cooperating to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' actions.

2. **Monitor Stock Trends:**
   - Track the stock level after each round. Calculate the trend over the past few rounds to determine if the stock is depleting faster than it can regenerate.

3. **Assess Others' Behavior:**
   - Estimate the number of cooperators and defectors based on total consumption relative to sustainable levels.
   - If average consumption per player exceeds the cooperative level, infer that others are defecting.

4. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - Continue cooperating if stock remains stable or grows, indicating sufficient cooperation among players.
   - Switch to defecting if the stock trend shows significant depletion, suggesting widespread defection.

5. **Exploitation Threshold:**
   - If the number of defectors exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., more than half), prioritize defecting to maximize immediate payoff before stock depletes further.

6. **Revert to Cooperation:**
   - If after defecting, the stock begins to recover and others seem to cooperate more, revert to cooperation to sustain long-term benefits.

7. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - In the final round, decide based on current state. Cooperate if the stock is healthy; otherwise, defect to secure remaining resources without future repercussions.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_15 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to create a decision-making process that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the resource. The strategy should adapt based on the actions of other players and the current state of the stock.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to observe others' behavior without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Cooperation Rates:** Track each player's historical cooperation rate, using a moving average or exponential smoothing to give more weight to recent actions.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, switch to Cooperate to help replenish the stock. If above, proceed based on others' behavior.
   - **Defection Response:** Calculate the average cooperation rate among other players. If this rate is below a certain threshold (e.g., 50%), Defect to avoid exploitation.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect.
   - **Rationale:** With no future rounds, maximize immediate payoff without concern for stock depletion.

### Detailed Decision Rules:

- **Cooperation Rate Calculation:**
  - For each player, maintain a cooperation rate based on their past actions. Use a moving average where the most recent round has the highest weight (e.g., α = 0.7).

- **Stock Threshold Mechanism:**
  - If stock < 50% of capacity, Cooperate to allow recovery.

- **Responsive Defection:**
  - Calculate others' average cooperation rate. If below threshold, Defect; otherwise, Cooperate.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def exploitative_strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        # Calculate stock threshold check
        if stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return "C"
        
        # Calculate average cooperation rate of others
        avg_coop = calculate_average_cooperation(history)
        if avg_coop < 0.5:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

    if current_round == r:
        return "D"

def calculate_average_cooperation(history):
    # Implement moving average or similar to get avg cooperation rate
    pass
```

### Strategy Rationale:

- **Adaptability:** The strategy adjusts based on both the stock level and others' behavior, ensuring it doesn't overly exploit the resource or allow itself to be exploited.
- **Sustainability:** By cooperating when the stock is low, the strategy promotes resource replenishment for future rounds.
- **Exploitation:** Defecting when others are mostly defecting prevents being taken advantage of, while defecting in the final round maximizes immediate gain.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors in a competitive setting.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_16 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of behavior and observe other players' actions without immediately exploiting.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Until the Penultimate Round)**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: 
     - If the current stock level is below 50% of the game's capacity, choose to Cooperate (C). This helps in replenishing the stock for future rounds.
     - If the stock is at or above 50%, assess the historical behavior of other players.
   - **Historical Defection Rate**:
     - Calculate the average number of defectors in the previous three rounds. If more than half of the players defected on average, choose to Defect (D) to exploit their tendency towards defection.
     - Otherwise, continue to Cooperate (C) to maintain a sustainable stock level.

3. **Last Round**: Always choose to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future rounds dependent on the current stock level.

This strategy balances exploiting others' tendencies with preserving resources for future gains, adapting dynamically based on both the game's state and players' past actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_17 = '''
To tackle the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we can employ an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring long-term sustainability while maximizing payoffs. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to observe others' behaviors and set a baseline for stock dynamics without immediate depletion.

2. **Stock Threshold Monitoring:**
   - **Threshold:** If the stock drops below 20% of capacity, switch to Defecting (D) to secure higher individual payoffs before potential depletion.
   - **Adjustment:** Continuously monitor the stock after each round and adjust strategy if it falls below this threshold.

3. **Defection Rate Analysis:**
   - **Measurement:** Track the number of times other players have defected in previous rounds, using a moving average or ratio to assess the trend.
   - **Trigger:** If the majority (e.g., more than 50%) of players consistently defect over two consecutive rounds, shift strategy to Defecting.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - **Observation:** After each round, evaluate both the stock level and opponents' actions.
   - **Switching Logic:** Cooperate if the stock is above the threshold and fewer than half of the players are defecting; otherwise, Defect to exploit the situation.

5. **Sustainability Check:**
   - **Growth Monitoring:** Ensure that after each round, the stock regrows sufficiently. If growth is insufficient despite cooperation, consider temporary defection to prevent over-reliance on others' cooperation.

6. **Final Rounds Strategy:**
   - **Last Round Action:** In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there's no future stock to preserve.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, current_stock, history):
    if len(history) == 0:
        return "C"  # First round: Cooperate
    
    stock_threshold = 0.2 * capacity
    defect_count = sum(1 for actions in history[-2:] for action in actions if action == 'D')
    total_players = n
    defect_ratio = defect_count / (2 * total_players)
    
    if current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return "D"
    elif defect_ratio > 0.5:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"

def main(n, r, capacity):
    history = []
    for round in range(r):
        if round == 0:
            action = "C"
        else:
            current_stock = get_current_stock()
            action = adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, current_stock, history)
        
        # Record the action and update history
        history.append(action)
        # Update stock based on all players' actions
        
    return total_payoff

```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a cooperative tone, allowing observation of others' strategies.
- **Stock Threshold:** Prevents depletion by switching to defection when the stock is critically low.
- **Defection Analysis:** Adapts strategy based on opponents' behavior, ensuring not to be exploited by consistent defectors.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Balances between cooperation for sustainability and defection for exploitation, keeping the strategy flexible.
- **Final Round Strategy:** Maximizes payoff in the last round without concern for future stock.

This approach ensures robustness against various opponent strategies while maintaining adaptability based on game dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_18 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round of the game, we can use a strategy that balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with defection to maximize immediate gains when necessary. The approach integrates monitoring of both the stock level and the number of defectors from previous rounds.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round (t=1):** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (t=2 to r-1):**
   - Track the number of players who defected in the previous round (D_count).
   - If D_count exceeds half of the total players, defect in the current round as punishment.
   - Otherwise, check the current stock level (S_current):
     - Cooperate if S_current is above a dynamic threshold based on remaining rounds.
     - Defect if S_current is below this threshold.
3. **Last Round (t=r):** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff.

### Dynamic Threshold Calculation:
The threshold for cooperation decreases as the game progresses, allowing more willingness to defect later in the game when fewer rounds remain. The threshold can be calculated as:

- Threshold(t) = (1 - t/r) * capacity

This means that earlier in the game, a higher stock level is required to cooperate, while later rounds allow lower stock levels for cooperation.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate.
2. For each subsequent round until the penultimate round:
   - Calculate D_count from the previous round.
   - If D_count > n/2: Defect.
   - Else:
     - Compute Threshold(t) = (1 - t/r) * capacity
     - If S_current > Threshold(t): Cooperate.
     - Else: Defect.
3. **Last Round:** Always defect.

This strategy encourages cooperation when the stock is high and others are cooperating, while defecting when necessary to maximize immediate gains or punish excessive defection.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_19 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll employ a dynamic approach that balances conservation with strategic exploitation based on game state and past actions. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Threshold and Round Position

1. **Initial Rounds (Early Game):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate in the first round to observe the stock dynamics and opponents' behavior.
   - **Rationale:** This initial cooperation helps maintain a high stock level early on, providing a buffer for future exploitation.

2. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - **Threshold:** Set a threshold at 50% of the game's capacity.
   - **Action:** After each round, assess the new stock level:
     - If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to Defecting in the subsequent rounds to maximize immediate gains.
     - Continue Cooperating as long as the stock remains above the threshold.

3. **Adaptation Based on Opponent Behavior:**
   - **Inference:** Use past stock changes and growth patterns to infer opponents' actions. Significant drops in stock despite cooperation may indicate widespread Defection.
   - **Action:** If it's evident that others are frequently Defecting (through observed low stock levels or slow recovery), switch to Defecting strategically.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect in the final round, as there is no future benefit from conserving the stock.
   - **Late Rounds:** In rounds nearing the end, prioritize immediate payoffs by Defecting more frequently, especially if the stock is not critically low.

### Pseudocode Illustration

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, total_rounds):
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity  # 50% of capacity
    
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif current_stock < threshold and round_num != total_rounds:
        return "D"  # Defect if stock is below threshold
    elif round_num == total_rounds:
        return "D"  # Always defect in the last round
    else:
        return "C"  # Cooperate otherwise

# Example usage within a loop over each round:
for t in range(1, r + 1):
    if t == 1:
        action = "C"
    else:
        previous_stock = ...  # Get stock from previous round
        current_stock_after_growth = calculate_new_stock(previous_stock)
        action = adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, current_stock_after_growth, t, r)
    # Execute action and update state
```

### Strategy Rationale

- **Early Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to maintain a healthy stock level and observe opponents' tendencies.
- **Threshold-Based Adaptation:** Dynamically switches to Defection when the stock is depleted beyond a safe point, preventing over-exploitation.
- **Endgame Exploitation:** Maximizes immediate gains in final rounds when future conservation no longer matters.

This strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, ensuring that while it may cooperate initially to preserve resources, it adapts to exploit when necessary, thereby optimizing its total payoff across all rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_20 = '''
To address the problem, we need a balanced approach that considers both immediate gains and long-term sustainability of the stock. The strategy should react to others' behavior while maintaining the stock at an optimal level for growth.

**Strategy:**

1. **Initialization**: Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline stock level.
2. **Track Variables**:
   - Average number of defectors per round (D_avg).
   - Current stock level (S_t) before your action each round.
3. **Decision Making**:
   - Calculate D_avg over recent rounds, say the last 5 rounds for responsiveness.
   - If D_avg exceeds a threshold (e.g., more than half of players), choose to Cooperate (C).
   - Otherwise, choose to Defect (D) to maximize immediate gains while maintaining stock sustainability.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Start with Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to gauge others' behavior.
2. **Monitor and Adjust**: After each round, update D_avg based on observed actions. If the average indicates too many defectors, switch to cooperation temporarily.
3. **Balance Stock Levels**: Continuously assess the stock level. If it drops below a sustainable threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), cooperate to allow recovery.

This strategy balances exploitation and conservation, ensuring that you maximize your gains while maintaining the stock for future rounds.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_21 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperative Phase:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a high stock level, promoting growth and setting a positive trajectory for future rounds.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - **Stock Level Monitoring:** Continuously observe the current stock after each round.
     - If stock > 50% of capacity, cooperate to maintain sustainability.
     - If stock ≤ 50%, defect to maximize immediate gain while the resource is still sufficient.
   - **Opponent Behavior Analysis:** Track others' actions. If a majority defected in previous rounds, increase defection rate to avoid exploitation.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - **Last Round (r):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as future stock levels no longer matter after the final round.

4. **Safeguards:**
   - Implement a minimum stock threshold. If stock falls below this level, switch to cooperation temporarily to prevent depletion and ensure future rounds have a viable resource.

This strategy balances maintaining the common pool for sustained benefits with strategic exploitation when advantageous, adapting based on both environmental and behavioral cues.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_22 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Conservation**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to initiate cooperation and build trust.
   - **Last Round (r):** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.
   - **Intermediate Rounds:**
     1. Calculate the proportion of players who defected in the previous round.
     2. If more than 50% defected, choose to Defect in the current round.
     3. Otherwise, Cooperate.

**2. Stock Conservation Mechanism:**
   - Monitor the stock level after each round's consumption and growth.
   - If the stock falls below 50% of capacity after growth, switch to Cooperate in the next round regardless of others' previous actions to allow recovery.

**3. Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to establish a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to secure maximum immediate gain.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize stock conservation by Cooperating if the stock is critically low, ensuring future rounds have sufficient resources.

**4. Adaptation and Robustness:**
   - The strategy dynamically adjusts based on observed behavior, promoting cooperation when beneficial and defecting when exploitation is detected.
   - By integrating both social behavior (responding to others' actions) and environmental factors (stock levels), the approach remains robust against varied opponent strategies.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to both the actions of others and the game's ecological state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_23 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll outline a structured approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy adapts to both the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round: Cooperate**
   - Start by cooperating to establish a high initial stock level, promoting resource sustainability for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds: Adaptive Decision-Making**
   - **Stock Health Check:** If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, switch to cooperation to allow recovery.
   - **Reciprocal Response:** Monitor the number of defectors in the previous round. If more than half defected, defect in the current round to avoid exploitation.

3. **Last Round: Exploit Maximally**
   - On the final round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there's no future stock growth.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def exploitative_strategy(n, r, capacity):
    previous_actions = []
    current_stock = capacity

    for t in range(1, r + 1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            if t == r:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                # Count number of defectors in the last round
                num_defectors = sum(1 for a in previous_actions[-n:] if a == 'D')
                
                if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
                    action = 'C'
                elif num_defectors > n / 2:
                    action = 'D'
                else:
                    action = 'C'

        # Record the action and update state
        previous_actions.append(action)
        
        # Calculate new stock level based on all players' actions (simulated externally)
        # For demonstration, assume simulate_stock_update function exists
        current_stock = simulate_stock_update(current_stock, previous_actions)

    return previous_actions

# Note: The simulate_stock_update function is not implemented here but would handle the game's stock dynamics based on player actions.
```

### Explanation:

- **First Round:** Cooperation initiates a high stock level, setting a positive trajectory for subsequent rounds.
- **Middle Rounds:** The strategy toggles between cooperation and defection based on stock health and others' past actions. Cooperating when the stock is low ensures resource conservation, while defecting when many others defected prevents being exploited.
- **Last Round:** Defecting maximizes immediate gain without concern for future depletion.

This approach ensures the strategy is both adaptive and exploitative, responding dynamically to game state and opponent behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_24 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a dynamic approach that balances cooperation with strategic exploitation. This strategy, named "Adaptive Exploitation," is designed to maximize payoffs while preserving the resource's sustainability.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to set a cooperative tone and sustain the stock at its maximum level. This initial cooperation encourages others to follow suit, potentially leading to higher future payoffs.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation (Subsequent Rounds):**
   - Track the average consumption per player each round. Calculate the ratio of actual consumption to the cooperative share (stock/(2n)).
   - If this ratio exceeds a threshold (e.g., 1.5), indicating excessive exploitation by others, switch to defecting. This prevents being exploited while still allowing for resource sustainability.

3. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Adjust the threshold based on stock depletion rates. Lower the threshold if the stock is depleting rapidly, prompting an earlier shift towards defection to secure payoffs before resources dwindle.

4. **Endgame Strategy (Last Few Rounds):**
   - In the final rounds, especially when there are fewer than 5 rounds remaining, defect more aggressively. This maximizes immediate payoffs since future stock replenishment becomes less relevant.

### Pseudocode Outline

```pseudocode
Initialize:
    cooperative_threshold = 1.5
    stock_history = []
    previous_actions = []

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        calculate average_consumption_per_player
        consumption_ratio = average_consumption_per_player / (stock_prev/(2n))
        if consumption_ratio > cooperative_threshold or stock_prev < capacity * 0.3:
            action = Defect
        else:
            action = Cooperate

    record action and observe others' actions
    update stock_history with new stock level

    if round > r - 5:
        action = Defect  // Aggressively defect in the last few rounds

Adjust cooperative_threshold dynamically based on stock depletion trends.
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages a sustainable start, maximizing future payoffs by maintaining a high stock level.
- **Adaptive Monitoring:** By tracking consumption ratios and adjusting strategies, the approach prevents being exploited while exploiting others when necessary.
- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Allow flexibility in response to varying depletion rates, ensuring timely shifts in strategy.
- **Endgame Focus:** Prioritizes immediate gains in later rounds, optimizing cumulative payoffs without compromising long-term sustainability excessively.

This strategy is robust against diverse opponent behaviors, balancing cooperation and exploitation to maximize overall payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_25 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we need a approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the stock. The strategy should adapt based on both the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to gauge others' initial behavior.
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - Calculate the average number of defections in previous rounds.
     - If more than half defected, defect in the next round.
     - Otherwise, cooperate.
   - Monitor the stock level. If it falls below 50% of capacity, switch to cooperation regardless of others' actions to allow regrowth.
3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

### Decision Rules:

- **First Round**: Always cooperate.
- **Middle Rounds**:
  - **Stock Check**: If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, choose Cooperate (C).
  - **Defection Threshold**: Calculate the average number of defections in previous rounds. If this average exceeds a threshold (e.g., more than half defected), choose Defect (D); otherwise, choose Cooperate (C).
- **Last Round**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff.

### Rationale:

- **First Round Cooperation**: This initial cooperation allows us to observe others' strategies without immediately signaling aggression.
- **Adaptive Response in Middle Rounds**: By mirroring the majority action of other players, we exploit their cooperative tendencies while being cautious if many are defecting. Additionally, monitoring stock levels ensures that we do not over-exploit and risk future payoffs.
- **Last Round Exploitation**: Since there is no future beyond the last round, defecting maximizes immediate gains without long-term consequences.

This strategy effectively balances exploitation with sustainability, ensuring that while we maximize our own gains, we also preserve the stock for future rounds when beneficial.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_26 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a dynamic approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection. The goal is to maximize individual payoff while preserving the resource for future rounds, adapting based on observed behavior and game state.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **First Round Cooperation:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to avoid immediate depletion of the stock and establish a baseline for others' actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Adaptation:**
   - **Track Consumption History:** Monitor total consumption and average per-player consumption from previous rounds.
   - **Defection Thresholds:** 
     - If the average consumption per player in the last round exceeds 1.5 times the cooperative amount (stock/(2n)), switch to defecting.
     - If the remaining rounds are limited (e.g., last 2-3 rounds), prioritize immediate gain by defecting.
   - **Stock Level Monitoring:** Defect if the current stock falls below a threshold, such as half of capacity, indicating potential depletion.

3. ** Forgiveness Mechanism:**
   - If after defecting, the stock shows significant recovery due to others' cooperation, consider switching back to cooperating to sustain future payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    round_num = len(history)
    
    if round_num == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    prev_consumption = sum(history[-1]['consumptions'])
    avg_prev Consumption = prev_consumption / n
    
    if avg_prev_consumption > (current_stock / (2 * n)) * 1.5:
        return 'D'
    
    rounds_remaining = r - round_num
    if rounds_remaining <= 2:
        return 'D'
    
    if current_stock < capacity / 2:
        return 'D'
    
    # Forgiveness check
    if round_num > 1 and history[-2]['stock'] > current_stock * 0.8:
        return 'C'
    
    return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to maintain stock health.
- **Adaptive Defection:** Switches to defecting based on historical consumption patterns, remaining rounds, and stock levels.
- **Forgiveness:** Allows reverting to cooperation if others start cooperating again, preventing unnecessary depletion.

This strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, ensuring both short-term gains and long-term sustainability of the resource.

To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can outline a structured approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy adapts based on game state and history, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C): This initial cooperation sets a baseline for stock health and allows observation of others' behavior without immediate exploitation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize payoff as there are no future consequences.
   - **Stock Trend Analysis:** Calculate the trend by comparing current stock levels with previous rounds. A negative trend indicates potential overexploitation, while a positive trend suggests sustainable use.
   - **Threshold-Based Decision:**
     - If the stock level falls below 70% of capacity and the trend is negative, switch to Cooperate (C) if not already doing so. This helps in stock recovery.
     - If the stock is above 70% and the trend is positive, consider Defecting (D), especially if others are exploiting, to maximize payoffs while maintaining stock health.

3. **Adaptation Mechanism:**
   - Use a responsiveness factor to determine how quickly to adapt based on stock changes. This could involve a moving average to smooth out fluctuations and make decisions more robust.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):

    round_num = len(history)
    
    if round_num == 0:

    previous_stock = history[-2]['stock']
    stock_trend = current_stock - previous_stock
    threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    
    if current_stock < threshold and stock_trend < 0:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage:
history = [...]  # List of previous states, each with 'stock' and 'actions'
action = strategy(n, r, capacity, history)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization:** Start with cooperation to establish a cooperative baseline.
- **Last Round Exploitation:** Defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff without future repercussions.
- **Trend and Threshold Management:** Monitor stock trends and levels. Cooperate if the stock is depleting below a sustainable threshold; otherwise, defect to exploit surplus when possible.
- **Adaptation:** Use observed stock changes to inform decisions, ensuring the strategy remains responsive yet stable.

This approach aims to balance short-term gains with long-term resource sustainability, adapting dynamically based on game state and collective player behavior.

To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing payoffs in this dynamic game while considering both immediate gains and future sustainability, we'll implement a threshold-based approach that adapts to the current stock level and the number of remaining rounds. Here's how you can decide whether to cooperate or defect:

### Strategy:
1. **Threshold Based on Stock Level**: 
   - If the current stock level is above 50% of the capacity, cooperate.
   - If it's below this threshold, defect.

2. **Endgame Consideration**:
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., when fewer than 10 rounds remain), prioritize defecting to maximize immediate gains since future payoffs become less significant.

3. **Observation of Stock Trends**:
   - While not explicitly modeled here, in a more advanced strategy, you could monitor trends over multiple rounds to detect sustained depletion and adjust your actions accordingly.

### Final Answer:
You should cooperate when the stock is above 50% of capacity and there are enough remaining rounds to justify preserving the stock for future payoffs. Otherwise, defect to maximize immediate gains. 

So, the decision rule is:

**Cooperate if:**  
- The current stock \( S_t \) is greater than 50% of the capacity (\( C \)), i.e., \( S_t > 0.5C \), and there are more than 10 rounds remaining.

**Defect otherwise.**

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting based on the game's progression and stock levels.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S_t > 0.5C \text{ and more than 10 rounds remain; otherwise, defect.}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_29 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in a dynamic game where the goal is to maximize payoff while considering the sustainability of a shared resource (stock), we developed an adaptive strategy. This approach balances exploiting current gains with conserving the stock for future rounds.

### Approach
The strategy is designed to be responsive to recent trends in the stock level and the actions of other players. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Round**: 
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale**: Start by cooperating to establish a baseline and observe how others behave.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1)**:
   - **Monitor Stock Trends**: After each round, compare the current stock level with the previous round's stock.
     - If the stock has decreased from the previous round, switch to Cooperate (C) in the next round to help replenish it.
     - If the stock is stable or increasing, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Final Round**:
   - **Action**: Always Defect (D)
   - **Rationale**: In the last round, there are no future consequences, so prioritize maximizing current payoff without concern for stock sustainability.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, previous_stock, current_stock, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        # Determine if the stock has decreased from the previous round
        if current_stock < previous_stock:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"

# Example usage within a loop over rounds:
history = []  # To keep track of past actions and stock levels, updated each round
for t in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    if t == 1:
        action = "C"
    elif t == total_rounds:
        action = "D"
    else:
        prev_stock = history[t-2]['stock']
        curr_stock = history[t-2]['new_stock']  # Assuming 'new_stock' is the stock after this round's actions and growth
        if curr_stock < prev_stock:
            action = "C"
        else:
            action = "D"
    # Record the action and update history with new stock level
    history.append({'round': t, 'action': action, 'stock': current_stock})
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, we set a conservative tone and allow observation of others' behaviors.
- **Responsive Strategy**: The strategy adapts based on whether the stock is depleting. If the stock decreases, it switches to cooperation to help sustain the resource for future rounds.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last round, there's no incentive to conserve, so defecting maximizes immediate gain without repercussions.

This approach ensures a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability, making it robust against varying behaviors of other players.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_30 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round, we can develop a strategic approach that balances exploiting others' cooperation with maintaining a sustainable stock level. This strategy is designed to maximize long-term payoffs by considering both the current state of the stock and the past actions of other players.

### Strategic Approach:

1. **Initialization:**
   - In the first round, always cooperate because the initial stock is at maximum capacity, providing a buffer against any potential early defections.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the current stock level as a percentage of the total capacity.
   - Track the average cooperation rate of other players over past rounds (excluding yourself).
   - Determine the number of remaining rounds to identify if it's the last round or not.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - If it is the last round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.
   - If the stock level is below 25% of capacity, cooperate to allow recovery.
   - For other cases:
     - Cooperate if both conditions are met:
       1. The current stock level is above 50% of capacity.
       2. At least half of other players' past actions were cooperation (C).
     - Defect otherwise.

4. **Adjustments for Sustainability:**
   - If the stock has been decreasing over previous rounds, consider lowering the cooperation threshold to prioritize recovery.

### Summary:

- **First Round:** Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - **Last Round:** Defect.
  - **Stock <25% Capacity:** Cooperate.
  - **Stock >=25% and Not Last Round:**
    - Cooperate if stock >50% AND majority of others cooperated previously.
    - Else, defect.

This strategy aims to exploit the cooperation of others while maintaining a sustainable stock level for future rounds, thereby optimizing long-term payoffs.

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Conservation-Exploitation (ACE)**

The ACE strategy aims to balance conservation of the common pool resource for future rounds with strategic exploitation to maximize current payoffs when necessary. It adapts based on both the remaining number of rounds and the current stock level.

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Early Rounds (First 25% of Total Rounds):** Cooperate to conserve the stock, allowing it to replenish and sustain future exploitation.
   - **Middle Rounds (Next 50% of Total Rounds):** Use a dynamic threshold based on the stock level relative to capacity. If the stock is above 50% of capacity, cooperate; otherwise, defect to secure payoffs before depletion.
   - **Late Rounds (Final 25% of Total Rounds):** Defect to maximize immediate gains as future rounds become less significant.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a high stock level for future sustainability.
   - **Last Round:** Always defect to ensure maximum payoff in the final round, regardless of previous actions.

3. **Adaptation Mechanism:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level after each round. If the stock drops below 50% of capacity before the designated exploitation phase, trigger an early shift towards defection.
   - Adjust the cooperation threshold dynamically based on observed stock trends to prevent premature depletion.

4. **Exploitative Mindset:** 
   - The strategy prioritizes long-term resource sustainability in early rounds but switches to maximizing short-term gains as the game progresses or if the stock becomes scarce, ensuring that the player doesn't miss out on potential payoffs.

This approach ensures robustness against various opponent behaviors by integrating both temporal and stock-level considerations, making it adaptive and exploitative.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_32 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, I present a structured approach that balances immediate gain with long-term sustainability. The strategy adapts based on the current state of the stock, the actions of other players, and the progression of the game through its rounds.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to encourage a high initial stock level and observe others' behaviors.

2. **Monitor and Adapt**:
   - Track the average cooperation rate of other players over the past few rounds.
   - Assess the current stock level relative to a threshold (e.g., capacity/2).

3. **Decision Making**:
   - If the stock is above the threshold and a significant number of players cooperated recently, defect to exploit their cooperation without severely depleting the stock.
   - If the stock is below the threshold or few players cooperated, cooperate to conserve the stock.

4. **Endgame Strategy**: As the game progresses towards the final rounds (e.g., after 70% of the rounds), prioritize defecting when the stock can sustain it to maximize payoffs in the remaining rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity):
    current_stock = capacity
    previous_actions = []
    threshold = capacity / 2
    endgame_round = int(0.7 * r)

    for t in range(1, r + 1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            # Calculate average cooperation rate of other players in the last round
            avg_coop = sum(1 for a in previous_actions[-n:] if a == 'C') / n

            if current_stock > threshold and avg_coop >= 0.5:
                action = 'D'  # Exploit cooperation
            elif t > endgame_round:
                action = 'D'  # Prioritize higher payoff in endgame
            else:
                action = 'C'  # Conserve stock

        previous_actions.append(action)
        # Update current_stock based on all players' actions (implementation details omitted)

    return previous_actions

# Example usage:
strategy_actions = adaptive_exploitation(n=4, r=10, capacity=100)
```

### Strategy Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, the strategy sets a positive tone and maintains a high initial stock, allowing for potential future exploitation.
  
- **Adaptive Decision Making**: The strategy continuously assesses both the stock level and others' actions. This adaptability ensures that it can shift between exploiting cooperation and conserving resources as needed.

- **Endgame Focus**: Recognizing that later rounds offer the last opportunities for payoffs, the strategy shifts towards defecting when sustainable, maximizing immediate gains without jeopardizing future rounds excessively.

This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors, balancing exploitation with conservation to maintain a competitive edge throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_33 = '''
To address this problem, we need a strategic approach that balances cooperative behavior to sustain resources with exploitative actions to maximize individual payoffs. The strategy must adapt based on the current state of the common pool and the observed behavior of other players.

### Approach
The proposed strategy is designed to be adaptive and exploitative, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors while maximizing personal payoff. It incorporates elements of reciprocity and sustainability, adjusting actions based on the stock level and historical player actions.

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' behavior.
2. **Stock Level Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the current stock level relative to capacity:
   - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, maintain Cooperative behavior if most players are Cooperating.
   - If the stock falls below 25%, switch to Defecting to secure higher immediate payoffs before the resource depletes further.
3. **Reciprocal Behavior**: Analyze opponents' past actions:
   - Cooperate more if others have been Cooperating, encouraging continued sustainability.
   - Increase Defection frequency if others frequently Defect, to avoid being exploited and maintain competitive payoffs.
4. **Punishment Mechanism**: Implement a graduated punishment for frequent Defectors by occasionally Defecting yourself, ensuring that exploiters face consequences without escalating into mutual destruction.
5. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final round, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Solution Code
```python
class ExploitativeCPRStrategy:
    def __init__(self, n, capacity):
        self.n = n
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.history = []  # Stores tuples of (round, player_actions, stock)
        
    def decide(self, current_stock, round_num, total_rounds):
        if round_num == 1:

        elif current_stock < low_threshold:
            return "D"  # Stock is critically low, defect to secure payoff
        else:
            if round_num == total_rounds:
                return "D"  # Last round, defect to maximize immediate gain
            else:
                # If opponents are mostly defecting, defect; else cooperate
                recent_actions = [a for actions in self.history for a in actions[1]]
                defector_count = sum(1 for a in recent_actions if a == 'D')
                defection_rate = defector_count / (self.n * len(self.history))
                
                if defection_rate > 0.3:

                    return "C"

    def update_history(self, round_num, actions, stock):
        self.history.append((round_num, actions, stock))

# Example usage in a game
strategy = ExploitativeCPRStrategy(n=4, capacity=100)
action = strategy.decide(current_stock=100, round_num=1, total_rounds=10)
print(action)  # Output: 'C'
```

### Explanation
The strategy begins with an initial Cooperative action to gauge others' behavior. It then dynamically adjusts based on the stock level and historical actions:

- **High Stock Levels**: Cooperate if most players are Cooperating to maintain resource sustainability.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Defect to secure immediate payoffs when resources are scarce.
- **Reciprocal Behavior**: Adjust cooperation rate based on others' past actions, encouraging continued cooperation or switching to defection as needed.
- **Endgame Defection**: Maximize payoff in the final round by defecting.

This approach ensures adaptability and robustness, balancing long-term sustainability with strategic exploitation to maximize personal payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_34 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll outline a structured approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy combines initial cooperation with adaptive decision-making based on past actions and current stock levels. It aims to exploit others' cooperative tendencies while safeguarding against resource depletion.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round Decision:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Initial cooperation sets a baseline, encouraging potential reciprocal behavior from other players without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Past Actions and Stock Levels:** Track the number of cooperators in the previous round and observe the current stock level.
   - **Threshold-Based Decision-Making:**
     - If the majority (>50%) of players cooperated last round:
       - Cooperate if the stock is above a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
       - Defect if the stock is below this threshold to capitalize on others' cooperation without over-depleting.
     - If fewer than half cooperated:
       - Defect to maximize immediate payoffs, as others are likely exploiting the resource heavily.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - **Low Stock (e.g., <30% of capacity):** Switch to cooperation temporarily to allow stock recovery, ensuring future rounds have sufficient resources.
   - **High Stock (e.g., >80% of capacity):** Defect to capture higher payoffs without significant risk of depletion.

4. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** In the final round, prioritize immediate gain since there's no future stock to preserve.

5. **Fallback Mechanism:**
   - If the stock drops critically low (e.g., <10% of capacity), switch to cooperation for a set number of rounds to prevent resource exhaustion and allow recovery.

### Implementation:
- **Initialization:** Start with cooperation in Round 1.
- **Loop Through Rounds:**
  - After each round, assess the number of cooperators and current stock.
  - Apply threshold logic to decide next action, adjusting based on recent trends.
  - In the last round, defect to maximize payoff.

### Example Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, history):
    if not history:  # First round
        return "C"
    
    prev_actions = history[-1]
    num_coop = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'C')
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    
    if len(history) == r:  # Last round
        return "D"
    
    if num_coop > n/2:
        if stock_ratio > 0.75:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
    else:
        return "D"
    
    # Fallback check for low stock
    if current_stock < 0.1 * capacity:
        return "C"

```

### Conclusion:
This strategy begins with cooperation to encourage mutual benefit, adapts based on others' actions and stock health, defects when advantageous, and ensures resource sustainability by conserving when necessary. It balances exploitation with preservation, aiming for optimal long-term payoffs in a competitive environment.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_35 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can adopt a trigger strategy that balances cooperation and punishment based on observed outcomes. Here's how the strategy is structured:

### Strategy Outline: Adaptive Trigger Strategy

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' behavior.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels:**
   - After each round, calculate the expected stock level if all players had cooperated.
   - Compare the actual stock level with this expectation.

3. **Trigger Mechanism:**
   - Define a threshold (e.g., 20%) below which cooperation is deemed insufficient based on stock levels.
   - If the stock falls significantly below the expected level, indicating widespread defection, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds.

4. **Punishment Phase:**
   - Once triggered, defect for a set number of rounds or until the stock begins to recover towards cooperative levels.
   - Continuously monitor the stock during this phase; if it shows signs of recovery due to others cooperating, consider reverting to cooperation.

5. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Cooperate if the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50%) to preserve resource sustainability beyond the current game.
   - **Stock Depletion:** If the stock reaches zero, default to defection as cooperation yields no benefit in subsequent rounds.

6. **Adaptive Adjustments:**
   - Modify the trigger threshold dynamically based on observed behavior and stock recovery rates.
   - Revert to cooperation if others appear to return to cooperative strategies after a punishment phase.

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def adaptive_trigger_strategy Parameters:
    n, r, capacity,
    current_stock, round_number, history
):
    if round_number == 1:
        action = "C"
    else:
        expected_coop_stock = calculate_expected_coop_stock(history)
        stock_shortfall = expected_coop_stock - current_stock
        threshold_met = stock_shortfall > 0.2 * capacity

        if not threshold_met and all_previous_actions == "C":
            action = "C"
        elif defect_triggered:
            action = "D"
            monitor_recovery()
            if recovery_observed:
                defect_triggered = False
        else:
            action = "C"

    handle_edge_cases(current_stock, round_number)
    return action

def calculate_expected_coop_stock(history):
    # Calculate expected stock based on full cooperation in previous rounds
    pass

def handle_edge_cases(stock, round):
    if round == r:  # Last round
        if stock > 0.5 * capacity:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
    elif stock <= 0:
        return "D"

```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to encourage mutual benefit.
- **Stock Monitoring and Trigger:** Uses the stock level as an indicator of others' behavior, switching strategies when exploitation is detected.
- **Punishment Phase:** Defects temporarily to enforce cooperation, monitoring for potential recovery.
- **Adaptation:** Adjusts based on observed outcomes, allowing flexibility in strategy.

This approach aims to maximize payoffs by balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to others' actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_36 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, I've developed a strategic approach that balances cooperation with exploitation, adapting based on others' behavior and the game's state.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' actions.
- **Rounds 2 to r-1:** 
  - Calculate the average cooperation rate (percentage) from all players in previous rounds.
  - If >=70% of players cooperated, choose Cooperate; else, Defect.
  - Additionally, if the stock drops below 30% of capacity, switch to Defect to maximize immediate gains.
- **Last Round (r):** 
  - Defect if most others defected in previous rounds or if stock is low.
  - If others were mostly cooperative and stock is sufficient, Cooperate to maintain fairness.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to encourage initial resource sustainability.
- **Low Stock Levels:** When stock is below a critical threshold (30% of capacity), Defect to secure immediate benefits, preventing further depletion by others.
- **Last Round Consideration:** Adjust strategy based on previous behavior to either exploit or conserve, depending on collective actions.

**3. Exploitative Mindset:**
- The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by adapting to the group's behavior, ensuring that if others are exploiting, you do too, preventing being taken advantage of.
- Balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by maintaining cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary.

### Summary

This strategy begins cooperatively, adapts based on collective behavior, and safeguards against stock depletion. It transitions to exploitation when others defect or when resources are scarce, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_37 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for extracting resources from a common pool, we must balance between maximizing immediate gains and preserving the resource for future use. This dilemma is akin to the Tragedy of the Commons, where individual self-interest can lead to overexploitation and depletion. The strategy outlined below aims to maximize personal gain while considering both the current state of the resource and others' past actions.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of resource preservation.
2. **Adaptive Behavior in Intermediate Rounds**: For each subsequent round (from the second to the penultimate), decide whether to cooperate or defect based on two key factors:
   - The current stock level relative to an upper threshold (e.g., 66% of initial capacity). If the stock is above this threshold, defect to exploit the resource.
   - The average number of defections by other players in previous rounds. If more than half of their actions were defections, defect to avoid being exploited.
3. **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last round, always choose to defect to maximize your immediate gain without regard for future sustainability.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate
     - Rationale: Start by preserving the resource to ensure its availability in subsequent rounds and encourage initial cooperation among all players.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1** (where r is the total number of rounds):
   - **Calculate Current Stock Level (S_t)**:
     - Monitor the stock level at the beginning of each round.
   - **Determine Defection Thresholds**:
     - Set a high threshold (HT) for the stock level, such as 66% of the initial capacity.
     - Assess the average number of defections (k_avg) by other players in previous rounds. This is calculated as the total number of defections observed divided by the number of previous rounds.
   - **Decision**:
     - If S_t > HT or k_avg ≥ 0.5, choose to Defect.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**:
   - **Action**: Defect
     - Rationale: Since there are no future rounds, maximize your immediate gain without concern for resource depletion.

### Implementation:

- **First Round**:
  ```python
  action = "Cooperate"
  ```
  
- **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1)**:
  ```python
  def decide_action(current_stock, history):
      # Calculate k_avg: average number of defections by other players
      total_defections = sum([1 for action in history if action == "Defect"])
      num_previous_rounds = len(history)
      k_avg = total_defections / num_previous_rounds if num_previous_rounds > 0 else 0
      
      # Set high threshold (e.g., 66% of initial capacity)
      ht = 0.66 * initial_capacity
      if current_stock > ht or k_avg >= 0.5:
          return "Defect"
      else:
          return "Cooperate"
  
  action = decide_action(current_stock, history_of_actions)
  ```
  
- **Last Round**:
  ```python
  action = "Defect"
  ```

### Explanation:

This strategy begins with cooperation to preserve the resource initially. As the game progresses, it adapts based on both the stock level and others' past actions. By defecting when the stock is plentiful or when others are exploiting, the strategy seeks to balance self-interest with sustainability. The final round prioritizes immediate gain, ensuring that the player captures as much value as possible before the resource is exhausted.

This approach aims to optimize personal payoff while considering both the current state of the resource and the behavior of other players, thereby addressing the dilemma effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_38 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing individual payoff by taking advantage of others' cooperative behavior while ensuring sustainable stock levels. The strategy adapts based on the game's state and history.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Always Defect (D). This maximizes immediate gain since there is no prior information about other players' tendencies.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as future consequences are irrelevant.
   - **Stock Depletion Check**: If the stock is zero, Defect since both actions yield zero payoff, but defects might exploit others who cooperate unknowingly.
   - **Exploitation Thresholds**:
     - Monitor the cooperation rate from the previous round. Calculate it as the number of players who Cooperated divided by total players (n).
     - If the current stock exceeds 75% of capacity and at least half of the players Cooperated last round, Defect to exploit their cooperative behavior.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate (C) to sustain the stock for future exploitation.

### Pseudocode Implementation

### Explanation

- **Initial Defection**: Starts with a Defect to capture immediate gains without prior data.
- **Last Round Maximization**: Defects in the final round to ensure no opportunity for gain is missed.
- **Stock and Cooperation Thresholds**: Uses recent cooperation rates and stock levels to decide when to exploit others' cooperative behavior, ensuring sustainability for future rounds.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, adapting to the dynamics of other players' actions.

### Exploitative Strategy Design: "Adaptive Resource Exploitation" (ARES)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C)
  - Rationale: Start by conserving the stock to maximize future payoffs while encouraging cooperation among other players.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - Calculate the total consumption in the previous round as a fraction of capacity.
    - If consumption was high (>50% of capacity), Defect (D) in the current round.
      - Rationale: High past consumption suggests others are defecting; defect to protect your share.
    - If consumption was low (≤50%), Cooperate (C).
      - Rationale: Low consumption indicates cooperation; maintain cooperation to sustain resource.

- **Stock Threshold:** If the stock after growth is below 20% of capacity, always Defect (D) in subsequent rounds.
  - Rationale: When the stock is critically low, prioritize immediate gain over future sustainability.

- **Last Round:** Always Defect (D)
  - Rationale: No future rounds to preserve; maximize current payoff.

#### 2. Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If stock is below threshold, defect to secure immediate benefits.
- **Last Round:** Exploit fully by defecting to maximize final payoff.

#### 3. Exploitative Mindset:
The strategy focuses on balancing cooperation to sustain the resource with defection when opponents exploit or when the resource is critically depleted. It adapts based on past actions and current state, ensuring robustness against various behaviors without relying on coordination.

This approach ensures that while I aim to maximize my own payoffs, I also maintain the health of the common pool unless circumstances dictate otherwise.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_40 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we need a balanced approach that maximizes individual payoffs while considering the sustainability of the common resource. The strategy should adapt based on the stock level and handle edge cases such as the first and last rounds effectively.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Level

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a high initial stock level, promoting sustainability for future rounds.
- **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):** 
  - If the current stock is above half of the capacity, continue to Cooperate. This helps maintain a high stock level, ensuring long-term payoffs.
  - If the stock drops below half of the capacity, switch to Defecting. This allows capturing higher immediate payoffs before the stock depletes further.
- **Last Round (Round r):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future rounds dependent on the stock.

**2. Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to set a positive trajectory for resource sustainability.
- **Last Round:** Prioritize immediate gain by Defecting since there's no subsequent impact on stock levels beyond this round.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
The strategy is designed to exploit the stock when it becomes scarce while preserving it when abundant. By Cooperating when the stock is plentiful and Defecting when it diminishes, the strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observable stock levels rather than relying on others' behaviors.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, capacity, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        threshold = capacity / 2
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

### Explanation

- **First Round:** Cooperation initiates a high stock level, beneficial for all players.
- **Middle Rounds:** The strategy switches based on a threshold (half of the capacity). This ensures that when the stock is abundant, cooperation maintains it, but when it's low, defecting captures more value before depletion.
- **Last Round:** Defecting maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

This approach is robust as it adapts to the stock level without requiring knowledge of others' strategies, making it suitable for a tournament setting against diverse opponents.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_41 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Level Adjustment (ACSLA)**

1. **Initial Action**: 
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to encourage a sustainable start.

2. **Action Decision**:
   - For each subsequent round, calculate the average cooperation rate of all other players based on their historical actions.
     - If the majority (>50%) have cooperated in previous rounds, choose C.
     - Otherwise, defect (D).
   - Additionally, assess the current stock level:
     - If the stock is below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), cooperate to facilitate recovery.
     - If the stock is high and stable near capacity, consider defecting to maximize immediate gain.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - In the final round, always defect to secure maximum payoff since there's no future impact.

4. **Robustness**:
   - The strategy adapts to others' behaviors, balancing cooperation to maintain stock health and defecting when exploitation is detected or necessary for immediate gain.

This approach ensures that the player maximizes their payoff while considering both current actions and future sustainability, adapting dynamically to the game's state and opponents' strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_42 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game scenario where players can observe past actions, we need a strategy that balances maintaining a sustainable resource with exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs. The following strategy is designed to achieve this balance:

### Strategy Overview

1. **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and maximizes the initial resource level.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - If the current stock level \( S \) is below half of the capacity (\( S < 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \)), Cooperate to help replenish the stock.
   - Otherwise, calculate the average cooperation rate of all players in previous rounds:
     - If the average cooperation rate is at least 50%, continue Cooperating.
     - If the average cooperation rate is below 50%, Defect to avoid being exploited.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - If the current stock level \( S \) is above half of the capacity (\( S > 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \)), Defect to maximize your final payoff.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate to ensure a decent payoff without depleting the resource excessively.

### Rationale

- **Cooperation in Early Rounds:** By starting with cooperation and continuing when others do so, you help maintain a high stock level, ensuring sustainable payoffs across rounds.
  
- **Defection When Necessary:** If others defect frequently, switching to defection protects against being exploited. Additionally, defecting in the last round when the stock is healthy maximizes immediate gain without future repercussions.

### Conclusion

This strategy adaptively responds to both the current state of the resource and the collective behavior of other players, aiming to optimize payoffs while preserving resource sustainability where beneficial.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_43 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and History**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Threshold for Cooperation:** Cooperate if the current stock is above 50% of capacity (threshold = capacity / 2).
   - **Defection Triggers:** Switch to Defecting if either:
     - The current stock drops below the threshold.
     - The average number of defections per player in the last three rounds exceeds 30%.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Default to Cooperate since there's no history, and initial stock is at capacity.
   - **Last Round:** Prioritize Defecting to maximize immediate payoff regardless of stock level.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - Monitor past actions to identify when others are defecting frequently.
   - Adjust strategy dynamically based on both current stock levels and historical behavior to exploit cooperative tendencies while avoiding being exploited.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
threshold = capacity / 2
x = 0.3  # 30% threshold for recent defections

if current_round == 1:
    action = Cooperate()
else:
    recent_defections = average number of defections per player in last 3 rounds
    if stock > threshold and recent_defections < x:
        action = Cooperate()
    else:
        action = Defect()

if round == r:  # Last round
    action = Defect()
```

This strategy balances cooperation to maintain resource sustainability with strategic defection to exploit others when necessary, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_44 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a series of rounds, considering both current stock levels and past actions of other players, we developed a balanced strategy. This approach aims to maximize immediate gains while preserving resources for future rounds.

### Approach
The strategy is designed as follows:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation helps establish a higher starting stock level.
2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - If the current stock (S) is below 50% of the capacity, choose to Cooperate (C). This prioritizes resource preservation for future rounds.
   - If S is above 50%, observe the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than half defected, choose to Defect (D); otherwise, Cooperate (C).
3. **Last Round (r)**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate gain since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, previous_actions, is_last_round):
    if is_last_round:
        return 'D'
    elif len(previous_actions) == 0:  # First round
        return 'C'
    else:
        count_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
        half_n = n / 2
        if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif count_defectors > half_n:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **First Round Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, we ensure that the stock remains high at the beginning.
- **Stock Threshold Check**: If the stock drops below 50% of capacity, cooperation is prioritized to allow recovery. This ensures that there are sufficient resources for future rounds.
- **Adaptive Decision Making**: Observing past actions allows the strategy to adapt. When a majority of players defected previously and the stock is sufficient, defecting maximizes current gain without jeopardizing future rounds excessively.
- **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, with no subsequent rounds to worry about, defecting ensures the highest possible immediate payoff.

This approach effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on both current conditions and past behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_45 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create a rule-based approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection. The strategy is adaptive, adjusting based on the game's state and history to maximize individual payoffs without assuming others' cooperation.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Rounds (First 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Encourage initial stock sustainability, promoting a cooperative environment that can lead to higher long-term yields.

2. **Middle Rounds (After Initial Phase):**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** Observe the stock after each round.
     - If the stock is above 50% of capacity, continue cooperating to maintain high future payoffs.
     - If the stock drops below 50%, switch to defecting to protect against over-exploitation by others.

3. **Late Rounds (Last 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Prioritize immediate gains as future rounds diminish in importance, maximizing short-term benefits.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock and adjust strategy if it falls below thresholds, indicating potential over-exploitation by others.

### Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
- **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff without future repercussions.

This strategy aims to exploit cooperative behavior while safeguarding against exploitation, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_46 = '''
To design an effective exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that considers both immediate gains and future sustainability. The strategy must adapt based on the game's state and history to maximize payoffs without relying on coordination with others.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and Round Progression

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **Initial Rounds (t < r):**
  - Calculate a dynamic threshold \( T(t) \) for each round, where:
    \[
    T(t) = \text{capacity} \times \max(0.7, 1 - \frac{t}{r})
    \]
    This means the threshold starts at 70% of capacity and decreases linearly as rounds progress.
  - **Defect** if the current stock \( S \) exceeds \( T(t) \).
  - **Cooperate** if \( S \) is below or equal to \( T(t) \).

- **Last Round (t = r):**
  - Always **defect** to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

- **Opponent Behavior Adaptation:**
  - Track the number of players who defected in previous rounds.
  - If more than half of the players defected in any round, switch to always defecting for all subsequent rounds to avoid being exploited.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline and allow the stock to grow.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is critically low (e.g., below 20% of capacity), cooperate to enable recovery, unless it's the last round.
- **High Defection Detection:** If in any round, more than half the players defected, defect in all subsequent rounds.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**

The strategy balances exploiting high stock levels for immediate gains while preserving enough stock for future growth. By adjusting the threshold based on the number of remaining rounds and adapting to opponents' behavior, the player avoids being a sucker and maximizes overall payoffs.

### Summary

- **Dynamic Threshold:** Adjusts based on round progression to balance immediate gain and future sustainability.
- **Opponent Adaptation:** Switches strategy if significant defection is detected to avoid exploitation.
- **Endgame Focus:** Maximizes payoff in the final round by always defecting, ensuring no missed opportunities.

This approach ensures the player strategically balances cooperation and defection, adapting as needed to maximize cumulative payoffs throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_47 = '''
To address the problem of determining whether to cooperate or defect in each round of a game with multiple players, where each player's action affects the stock level (a shared resource), we can develop a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy is designed to maximize total payoff by considering both current conditions and historical actions. It combines the state of the shared resource (stock level) with observed behavior patterns of other players to decide whether to cooperate or defect in each round.

### Key Components of the Strategy:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of behavior and observe the outcome.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: Track the stock level after each round. If it's high, defecting is less risky. If low, cooperation helps conserve the resource.
3. **Track Historical Actions**: Note the number of defections by other players in previous rounds to gauge their behavior patterns.
4. **Dynamic Decision-Making**:
   - Cooperate if the stock level is below a certain threshold or if others have been mostly cooperative.
   - Defect when the stock is plentiful and others' defection rate is relatively low, indicating it's safe to exploit without significant depletion.
5. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final round, prioritize immediate gain by defecting.

### Detailed Strategy:
1. **First Round**:
   - Cooperate (C). This action helps establish a baseline of cooperation and allows observation of other players' initial actions.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - For each subsequent round, calculate the average stock level over the past few rounds.
   - Track the total number of defections by all players in previous rounds.
   - If the current stock level is above 75% of the capacity and the average defection rate among other players is below 30%, choose to Defect (D).
   - Otherwise, Cooperate (C) to conserve the resource.

3. **Last Round**:
   - Always Defect (D) in the final round to maximize immediate gain without worrying about future depletion.

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Establishes a cooperative tone and provides initial data on others' behavior.
- **Stock Level Monitoring**: Ensures that exploitation occurs when the resource is plentiful, reducing risks associated with over-depletion.
- **Historical Defection Tracking**: Allows the strategy to adapt based on others' tendencies, balancing between exploiting cooperation and conserving resources.
- **Endgame Defection**: Maximizes immediate payoff in the last round since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Summary:
The proposed strategy dynamically adjusts behavior based on resource availability and collective past actions. It aims to exploit opportunities for higher payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability, ensuring a balance between short-term gains and long-term resource health.

     - If the average number of defectors exceeds 50%, switch strategy to Defect (D).
     - Use a moving average or exponentially weighted average to prioritize recent behavior.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - After each round, evaluate the stock level after growth.
     - If the stock falls below 30% of capacity, begin defecting to maximize immediate gains before further depletion.

4. **Last Round Action:**
   - Always Defect (D) in the final round to secure maximum payoff without future consequences.

This strategy balances cooperation and exploitation by adapting to opponents' behavior and resource sustainability, aiming to optimize long-term payoffs while being responsive to changes in the game state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_49 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Exploitation (ATE)**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to encourage a cooperative environment.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - Calculate the number of defectors in the previous round.
     - If the proportion of defectors exceeds 50%, switch to Defect (D).
     - If stock level drops below 25% of capacity, cooperate to conserve unless it's the last round.
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to set a positive tone.
   - **Low Stock Levels (<25% capacity):** Prioritize conservation by Cooperating, unless it's the last round.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to secure maximum current payoff without concern for future depletion.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - Continuously monitor opponents' actions and adapt strategy based on their behavior.
   - Balance between exploiting current stock for higher payoffs and preserving stock for future rounds by adjusting cooperation levels dynamically.

This strategy ensures adaptability, robustness against various behaviors, and maximizes total payoff by considering both immediate gains and long-term resource sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_50 = '''
To address the problem, I'll outline a strategic approach for the Common Pool Resource Game that balances exploitation with sustainability, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.

### Strategic Approach: Adaptive Exploitation Strategy (AES)

**Objective:** Maximize cumulative payoff by dynamically adjusting between cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and stock levels.

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage initial cooperation among players.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Calculate the cooperation rate as the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
  - If the cooperation rate is above a threshold (e.g., 50%) and the stock level exceeds a lower bound (e.g., 30% of capacity), cooperate. Otherwise, defect.
- **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since future consequences are irrelevant.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a cooperative tone.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), switch to defection to prevent over-depletion and protect future payoffs.
- **Last Round:** Defect regardless of previous actions to maximize immediate gain.

#### 3. Exploitative Mindset:
The strategy exploits opponents by mirroring their behavior when cooperation is high but switches to defection when others defect or when the stock is at risk, ensuring protection against exploitation and depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy Parameters(n, r, capacity):
    Initialize:
        coop_threshold = 0.5  # Cooperation threshold (50%)
        stock_lower_bound = 0.3 * capacity  # Lower stock bound

    For each round t from 1 to r:
        if t == 1:
            action = "C"
        else:
            prev_coop_count = count of players who chose C in round t-1
            cooperation_rate = prev_coop_count / n
            S_prev = stock level at end of round t-1

            if cooperation_rate >= coop_threshold and S_prev > stock_lower_bound:
                action = "C"
            else:
                action = "D"

        if t == r:  # Last round
            action = "D"

    Return action for each round
```

### Explanation:

- **Decision Rules:** The strategy begins with cooperation to foster a collaborative environment. It then adapts based on the majority's actions and stock health, ensuring it doesn't get exploited while maintaining resource sustainability.
- **Edge Cases:** Special handling ensures the strategy starts optimally, prevents stock depletion, and maximizes payoff in the final round.
- **Exploitative Nature:** By defecting when others do or when resources are scarce, the strategy effectively protects its payoffs without relying on others' cooperation.

This approach balances between exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs and sustaining the resource for future rounds, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_51 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy must adapt based on observable game state and history without relying on cooperation from others. Below is the structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Trends (AEBST)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to observe initial stock dynamics.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Track the stock level after each round and determine if it's increasing, decreasing, or stable.
  - Use thresholds based on the capacity:
    - If stock is above 75% of capacity, Defect (D).
    - If stock is below 25%, Cooperate (C).
    - Between 25%-75%, base decision on trend:
      - **Decreasing Trend**: Cooperate to prevent depletion.
      - **Increasing/Stable Trend**: Defect to exploit abundance.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Start with Cooperation to gauge others' behavior without immediate depletion.
- **Last Two Rounds**: Always Defect (D) as future stock sustainability is no longer a concern.

#### 3. Adaptation Mechanism:
- Adjust thresholds dynamically based on observed trends and remaining rounds. For example, lower the cooperation threshold if stock depletion accelerates.
- Consider opponents' past actions: mirror defection if others frequently defect, while rewarding cooperators by occasionally cooperating.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def aebst_strategy(game_params, current_state, history):
    n = game_params['n']
    r = game_params['r']
    capacity = game_params['capacity']
    stock = current_state['stock']
    round_num = current_state['round_number']

    if round_num == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Determine trend
    prev_stock = history[round_num-2]['stock_after']
    trend = 'decreasing' if stock < prev_stock else ('increasing' if stock > prev_stock else 'stable')

    if round_num >= r - 1:  # Last two rounds
        return 'D'
    
    threshold_low = 0.25 * capacity
    threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity

    if stock <= threshold_low:
        action = 'C'
    elif stock >= threshold_high:
        action = 'D'
    else:
        if trend == 'decreasing':
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'

    # Optional: Adjust based on opponent behavior
    # defect_count = sum(h['actions'].count('D') for h in history)
    # cooperation_rate = 1 - (defect_count / (n * len(history)))
    # if cooperation_rate < 0.5:
        # action = 'D'

    return action

# Example usage:
game_params = {'n': 5, 'r': 10, 'capacity': 100}
history = [...]  # List of previous round states
current_state = {'stock': 80, 'round_number': 3}

action = aebst_strategy(game_params, current_state, history)
print(action)  # Output: 'D' or 'C'
```

### Explanation:
- **First Round**: Observes initial dynamics by Cooperating.
- **Stock Trends**: Uses thresholds to decide actions based on stock level relative to capacity.
- **Adaptation**: Adjusts strategy as trends change, conserving when depletion is evident and exploiting when safe.
- **Endgame Focus**: Prioritizes immediate payoffs in final rounds.

This approach ensures a balance between exploiting high stock levels and preserving resources for future rounds, adapting dynamically to maintain optimal outcomes.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C) to encourage others to do the same and build a healthy stock for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Last Round (Round r):** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future stock to preserve.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock is below a threshold (e.g., capacity/2), Defect. This indicates potential over-exploitation by others, necessitating a shift to protect your payoffs.
   - **Defection Monitoring:** Track the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than 50% defected, switch to Defecting this round to avoid being exploited.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the stock is very low (e.g., close to zero), defect immediately as preservation isn't feasible.
   - If a significant number of players defected in the previous round leading to a substantial drop in stock, consider defecting to secure your interests.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
if current_round == 1:
    action = C
elif current_round == r:
    action = D
else:
    if stock < threshold (e.g., capacity/2):

        if count_defectors_previous > n/2:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C

execute action and update strategy based on new state and history
```

This strategy balances cooperation to maintain stock health with strategic defection when necessary, ensuring exploitative efficiency while adapting to the game's dynamics.

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a dynamic strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observed stock levels. This approach ensures that while we aim to maintain a sustainable resource for future rounds, we also protect ourselves from being exploited by others' overexploitation.

### Strategy Overview

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate unless it is the last round of the game.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Monitor the stock level after each round.
   - If the new stock level after growth drops below a specified threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) or shows a decreasing trend over several rounds, switch to defecting in the next round.
   - Continue cooperating if the stock remains healthy and stable.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

### Detailed Strategy

- **Initialization**: Start with cooperation in the first round unless it's the final round, where defection is chosen immediately.
  
- **Stock Monitoring**: After each round, evaluate whether the stock level has decreased significantly. This can be determined by checking if the new stock is below a set threshold or if there's a noticeable downward trend over several rounds.

- **Adaptive Switching**:
  - If the stock is deemed to be overexploited (below the threshold or decreasing), defect in the next round to either maximize short-term gains or encourage others to revert to cooperation.
  - If the stock remains robust, continue cooperating to sustain future payoffs.

### Rationale

This strategy aims to exploit the balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability. By initially cooperating, it supports a healthy stock level. However, by monitoring and responding to signs of overexploitation, it adapts to prevent depletion and possible exploitation by others. Defecting in the last round ensures maximizing final payoffs without concern for future impacts.

This approach is robust against various opponent strategies, ensuring adaptability and safeguarding against being taken advantage of while promoting resource sustainability when possible.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_54 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game while maximizing payoffs, we can employ an adaptive strategy that considers both the current state (stock level) and past behavior of other players. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy:
1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning**: Cooperating in the first round helps maintain a high stock level for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Calculate Estimated Defectors**: For each previous round, compute the estimated number of defectors using the formula derived from total consumption and stock levels.
     - Formula: \( d = \frac{2n \times X_{\text{prev}}}{S_{\text{prev}}} - n \)
     - Where:
       - \( n \) is the number of players.
       - \( X_{\text{prev}} \) is the total consumption in the previous round.
       - \( S_{\text{prev}} \) is the stock level at the start of the previous round.
   - **Stock Level Check**:
     - If the current stock level (\( S_t \)) is below 20% of the capacity, Cooperate to allow regrowth.
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.
   - **Defector Threshold**:
     - If the estimated number of defectors (\( d \)) from the previous round is at least half the number of players (i.e., \( d \geq n/2 \)), then Defect in the current round. Otherwise, Cooperate.

### Summary:
- **First Round**: Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If stock is below 20% capacity: Cooperate.
  - If it's the last round: Defect.
  - Else, if more than half of the players defected previously: Defect.
  - Otherwise: Cooperate.

This strategy balances cooperation to maintain resources with strategic defection when others exploit, ensuring adaptive play that maximizes payoffs.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and observe others' actions.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     1. **Track Cooperation Rate:** Calculate the average number of players who cooperated in previous rounds.
     2. **Stock Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
     3. **Defection Threshold:** If the percentage of defectors exceeds a threshold (e.g., more than 50% of players defecting), switch to Defect (D).
     4. **Stock Level Check:** If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, switch to Defect to maximize immediate gains.
   - **Endgame Strategy:** In the last round or last few rounds (e.g., last two rounds out of r), always Defect (D) to secure maximum immediate payoffs without concern for future growth.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to initiate cooperation and gauge others' strategies.
   - **Last Rounds:** Defect to prioritize immediate gains over long-term sustainability.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to defecting if the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) to prevent depletion and secure higher payoffs.

3. **Exploitative Mindset:**
   - The strategy adapts based on others' actions, rewarding cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to exploit non-cooperative behavior.
   - Monitors both the stock level and opponents' behavior to balance between maintaining resources and maximizing personal gain.

4. **Pseudocode Example:**

```
function decide_action(history, current_stock, capacity, round, total_rounds):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate average cooperation rate from history
    avg_coop = calculate_average_cooperation(history)
    
    # Check stock level against threshold
    if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
        return 'D'
    
    # Determine if defectors exceed threshold
    if avg_defectors > 0.5:
        return 'D'
    
    # In last few rounds, defect
    if round > total_rounds - 2:
        return 'D'
    
    # Otherwise, cooperate
    return 'C'

# Helper function to calculate average cooperation rate
function calculate_average_cooperation(history):
    total_coop = 0
    for each previous_action in history:
        if previous_action == 'C':
            total_coop += 1
    avg_coop = total_coop / (number of players * number of rounds)
    return avg_coop
```

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, ensuring that while it starts cooperatively, it can switch to defecting when others fail to cooperate or when the stock is at risk. It balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, particularly in the endgame.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_56 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the resource. The strategy adapts based on observed behavior and current stock levels.

### Strategy: Smoothed Adaptive Exploitation (SAX)

**Parameters:**
- **T**: Stock threshold set at 50% of capacity.
- **D**: Defection tolerance rate of 0.5 (50%).
- **k**: Considers the past 3 rounds for defection rate calculation.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
     - *Rationale:* Encourages initial resource sustainability and cooperation tone.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   a. Calculate the average defection rate over the past `k` rounds (or fewer if less than `k` rounds have occurred).
      - Defection_rate = (Total defectors in last k rounds) / (n * k)
   b. Observe current stock level.
   c. Apply the following logic:
      - If current stock < T: Cooperate to aid resource replenishment.
      - Else if Defection_rate > D: Defect to exploit others' behavior.
      - Else: Cooperate to maintain resource health.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **Low Stock (below T):** Prioritize cooperation regardless of defection rates to prevent depletion.
- **High Stock (above T):** Exploit by defecting if recent defection rate exceeds tolerance; otherwise, cooperate.
- **Last Round (if known):** Defect to maximize immediate payoff as future impact is negligible.

This strategy ensures adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors while maintaining the resource for sustained payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_57 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, we'll use a dynamic approach considering past actions and current stock levels. Here's the structured strategy:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of others' initial moves.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - After each round, assess the stock level after growth.
   - Count the number of cooperators (C_count) and defectors (D_count).
   - If the stock is above 75% capacity AND more players cooperated last round: Defect (D)
   - If the stock is below 50% capacity: Cooperate (C) to aid recovery
   - Otherwise, cooperate if C_count ≥ D_count; else defect

3. **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

This strategy adaptively switches between cooperation and defection based on stock health and collective behavior, aiming to exploit others' cooperation while preserving resource sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_58 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing individual payoffs by adapting to the current state and history. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Trends and Round Progression

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe the initial impact on the stock.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels and Trends:**
   - After each round, calculate the stock level relative to capacity.
   - Track the trend by comparing the current stock with previous rounds to determine if depletion is accelerating.

3. **Threshold-Based Defection:**
   - Set a threshold at 70% of the capacity. If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds.
   - Continue defecting until the stock begins to recover above the threshold, indicating possible cooperation from others.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment for Sustainability:**
   - Use a moving average of stock changes over recent rounds to smooth out fluctuations and make decisions based on trends rather than single-round outcomes.

5. **Round-Dependent Behavior:**
   - As the game progresses, especially in later rounds (e.g., last 20%), increase the tendency to defect.
   - In the final round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds don't exist.

6. **Exploitative Decision-Making:**
   - If others are cooperating (stock is above threshold), exploit by defecting to gain higher payoffs while they sustain the resource.
   - If significant defection is observed (stock below threshold), defect to avoid being exploited and secure remaining resources.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, total_rounds, history):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    previous_stock = history['stock'][round_num - 2]  # Assuming history tracks from round 0
    
    if stock_ratio > 0.7:
        return "C"
    else:
        if round_num > 0.8 * total_rounds:  # Last 20% of rounds
            return "D"
        else:
            # Calculate stock change trend
            recent_stocks = history['stock'][-3:]  # Last three stocks
            avg_change = (recent_stocks[-1] - recent_stocks[0]) / len(recent_stocks)
            if avg_change < 0:  # Stock is decreasing on average
                return "D"
            else:
                return "C"

    if round_num == total_rounds:
        return "D"  # Always defect in the last round

# Example usage within a game loop
current_strategy = adaptive_exploitation_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, r, history)
```

### Explanation of Strategy Components

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages others to cooperate and sets a positive tone.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Uses relative stock levels to gauge collective behavior and decide actions.
- **Threshold Defection:** Balances exploitation with sustainability by defecting when the resource is significantly depleted.
- **Dynamic Trends:** Smooths decision-making using recent stock trends to avoid overreacting to single rounds.
- **Round Adjustment:** Increases defection in later rounds, especially near the end, to maximize short-term gains without future consequences.

This strategy aims to exploit others' cooperation while minimizing risks of resource depletion by adapting dynamically based on observable game states.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Start by Defecting (D) to test opponents' reactions and maximize initial payoff.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate of all players from the previous round.
     - If the average cooperation rate is above a threshold (e.g., 50%), Cooperate (C) to sustain resource levels.
     - If the cooperation rate is below the threshold, Defect (D) to exploit the situation.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Phase (First Round):**
   - Cooperate (C) to observe others' actions without depleting the stock initially.

2. **Monitoring and Decision-Making:**
   - After the first round, track the cooperation rate (proportion of players choosing C) each round.
   - Assess the current stock level relative to capacity.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - If the cooperation rate is greater than 75% and the stock is above a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), Defect (D) to exploit others' cooperation.
   - If the cooperation rate is less than 50%, Cooperate (C) to help recover the stock for future exploitation.
   - For cooperation rates between 50-75%, use a mixed strategy, possibly alternating actions based on additional factors like recent stock trends.

4. **Stock Health Consideration:**
   - If the current stock is below a critical level (e.g., 25% of capacity), Cooperate to allow recovery, ensuring future rounds have sufficient resources.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last round, always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
Initialize cooperation_threshold_high = 0.75
cooperation_threshold_low = 0.50

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Strategy Overview:**
The strategy is designed to balance cooperation and exploitation, adapting based on opponents' past actions and the current stock level. It aims to maximize personal payoff while encouraging sustainable resource use.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative tone and observe others' behaviors.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Previous Cooperation Check:** Calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in the last round.
     - If ≥50% cooperated, continue cooperating if stock is above 25% of capacity.
     - If <50% cooperated, defect for up to 2 rounds (punishment phase).
   - **Stock Level Check:** If current stock is below 25% of capacity, cooperate to replenish, regardless of others' actions.

3. **Final Rounds:**
   - In the last two rounds (r-1 and r), switch to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as future punishment isn't possible.

### Handling Edge Cases:
- **Low Stock:** Prioritize cooperation if stock falls below 25% of capacity to prevent depletion.
- **Punishment Phase:** After defecting for 2 rounds, reassess others' cooperation. If they return to cooperating, resume cooperation.

### Exploitative Mindset:
The strategy exploits opponents by mirroring their behavior, punishing defection transiently, and maximizing gains in final rounds without assuming others' cooperation.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round, history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    last_actions = history[-1]
    coop_rate = sum(1 for action in last_actions if action == 'C') / n
    
    stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    punishment_rounds = 2
    punish_counter = 0

    if current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    
    if coop_rate >= 0.5 and current_stock > stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if punish_counter < punishment_rounds:
            punish_counter +=1
            return 'D'
        else:
            # Re-evaluate after punishment phase
            return 'C' if coop_rate >= 0.5 else 'D'

    if round in [r-1, r]:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection, ensuring sustainability while exploiting others' behavior to maximize personal gain.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_62 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - The strategy is adaptive, adjusting based on current stock levels, historical player actions, and the remaining rounds.
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to encourage initial sustainability.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - If the stock (S) is below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), Cooperate to aid regrowth.
     - Monitor the percentage of players who defected in the previous round. If defection exceeds a certain rate (e.g., 50%), Cooperate to prevent over-depletion.
     - Otherwise, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs while considering stock sustainability.
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect to exploit the remaining stock without regard for future consequences.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Initiate with cooperation to set a sustainable tone.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to cooperation if stock falls below a critical threshold to ensure resource availability in subsequent rounds.
   - **Last Round:** Prioritize immediate gain by defecting, as there are no future rounds dependent on the current stock.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - The strategy balances between exploiting others' cooperative tendencies and protecting against exploitation by adapting to observed behaviors.
   - It uses historical data on defection rates to decide actions, ensuring it doesn't become a consistent sucker but also avoids mindless defection leading to resource depletion.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```
Initialize:
    cooperation_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    defection_rate_threshold = 0.5
    remaining_rounds = r

For each round from t=1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        previous_defectors = count of D actions in last round
        D_percent = previous_defectors / n
        current_stock = S_t

        if current_stock < cooperation_threshold or D_percent > defection_rate_threshold:
            action = C
        elif t == r:  # Last round
            action = D
        else:
            action = D

    consume according to action
    record own action and observe others' actions for next round calculation
```

This strategy effectively integrates proactive measures to sustain resource health while strategically exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs, ensuring adaptability across various game scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_63 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we need a balance between maximizing immediate gains and preserving the stock for future rounds. The strategy should adapt based on the current stock level and historical trends.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Dynamic Threshold (AEDT)

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Threshold Calculation**: Set a dynamic threshold T that starts at 50% of the capacity. Adjust T based on the trend of the stock over the past few rounds.
     - If the stock has been decreasing in recent rounds, lower T by a small percentage (e.g., 5%).
     - If the stock has been increasing or stable, raise T by a small percentage.
   - **Action Selection**:
     - In each round t, observe the current stock level S_t.
     - Cooperate if S_t is below T; otherwise, defect.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage others and gauge their behavior.
   - **Last Round (t = r)**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.
   - **Stock Depletion**: If the stock drops to 0, continue defecting as cooperation won't yield any benefit.

3. **Adaptation Mechanism**:
   - Track the stock level over the past few rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds) to determine the trend.
   - Adjust T after each round based on whether the stock is increasing or decreasing, ensuring smooth transitions and preventing rapid oscillations.

4. **Exploitative Mindset**:
   - By defecting when the stock is plentiful, you exploit the common resource for higher immediate gains.
   - Cooperating when the stock is low helps sustain the resource for future exploitation, ensuring longer-term payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def aedt_strategy(game_parameters, current_state, history):
    n = game_parameters['n']
    r = game_parameters['r']
    capacity = game_parameters['capacity']
    current_round = history['current_round']
    stock_history = history['stock_levels']

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Determine the trend in recent stock levels
    recent_stocks = stock_history[-3:]  # Last 3 rounds' stock levels
    trend = sum(1 for i in range(1, len(recent_stocks)) if recent_stocks[i] > recent_stocks[i-1]) - \
           sum(1 for i in range(1, len(recent_stocks)) if recent_stocks[i] < recent_stocks[i-1])

    # Adjust threshold T based on trend
    T = capacity / 2
    if trend > 0:  # Stock is increasing or stable
        T *= 1.05
    elif trend < 0:  # Stock is decreasing
        T *= 0.95

    current_stock = current_state['stock']

    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > T:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to encourage others and maintain stock.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: The threshold adapts based on recent stock trends, promoting flexibility in strategy.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Defects in the last round to maximize immediate gain without concern for future stock levels.
- **Balanced Approach**: Cooperates when the stock is low to sustain it, ensuring future payoffs while defecting when the stock is high to exploit resources.

This strategy effectively balances exploitation and conservation, adapting dynamically to the game's state and history.

### Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game

#### 1. Decision Rules
The strategy is based on monitoring the stock level, observing opponents' past actions, and adapting behavior to maximize payoffs while ensuring long-term sustainability of the resource. The key principle is to cooperate when cooperation is reciprocated and defect when opponents are exploiting the resource excessively.

- **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C).  
  - Rationale: Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of stock conservation and observe others' initial behavior.

- **Subsequent Rounds**: Use the following rules:
  1. Calculate the average number of defections in the previous round.  
     - If the average defection rate is above 50%, defect (D) in the current round.  
     - If the average defection rate is below 50%, cooperate (C).  
  2. Monitor the stock level relative to capacity:  
     - If the stock is below 25% of capacity, always Cooperate (C) to allow replenishment.  
     - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, defect (D) to maximize current payoff without risking depletion.  

- **Last Round**: Always Defect (D).  
  - Rationale: In the final round, there is no future cost to overexploitation, so maximize immediate payoff.

#### 2. Edge Cases
- **First Round**: Cooperate unconditionally to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' behavior.
- **Low Stock Levels** (<25% of capacity): Switch to Cooperation (C) regardless of opponents' actions to prevent depletion.
- **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

#### 3. Exploitative Mindset
The strategy is designed to exploit the following:
1. Opponents who cooperate consistently are rewarded by maintaining a sustainable stock level, allowing them to continue benefiting from cooperation.
2. Opponents who defect frequently are punished by reducing cooperation, forcing them to bear the cost of overexploitation.
3. The stock dynamics are exploited by conserving when necessary (low stock levels) and harvesting aggressively when the stock is plentiful.

### Pseudocode
```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history)
    
    if current_round == 0:  # First round
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate average defection rate in previous round
    defectors = sum(1 for actions in history[-1] if actions == 'D')
    avg_defection = defectors / n
    
    stock = history['stock']  # Current stock level
    
    if current_round == r:  # Last round
        return "D"
    
    if stock < 0.25 * capacity:
        return "C"
    elif stock > 0.75 * capacity:
        return "D"
    else:
        if avg_defection > 0.5:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
```

### Summary
This strategy is adaptive, robust, and exploitative. It starts with cooperation to establish a sustainable baseline but quickly adapts to opponents' behavior by punishing frequent defection and conserving when the stock is low. The final round is exploited for maximum payoff, ensuring the strategy performs well against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and encourage initial stock preservation.
   
   - **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1):**

     2. **Majority Defection Check:** If more than half of the players Defected in the previous round, Defect in the current round to exploit their behavior.
     3. **Payoff Threshold Check:** If your average payoff so far is below 80% of the maximum possible (calculated based on initial capacity), switch to Defect to increase immediate gains.
     4. Otherwise, Cooperate to maintain a balance between exploitation and preservation.

   - **Last Round (r):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, regardless of other factors, Cooperate to initiate cooperation.
   - When the stock is critically low (below 20% of capacity), prioritize replenishment by Cooperating.
   - In the final round, exploit fully by Defecting to secure the highest possible immediate payoff.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
   The strategy is designed to be adaptive and exploitative by:
   - Encouraging cooperation initially to maintain a healthy stock level.
   - Punishing defectors by switching strategies when necessary, thus exploiting their behavior for higher payoffs.
   - Balancing between immediate gains and long-term stock health through dynamic checks on stock levels and historical player actions.

This approach ensures robustness against various opponent behaviors while maximizing payoffs across the game's duration.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to adapt based on opponents' past actions and the current state of the stock. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance against diverse behaviors.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to maximize initial stock growth, encouraging a high starting point for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Previous Actions:** Track the number of players who defected in the last round.
   - **Stock Evaluation:** Assess the current stock level and its trend (increasing or decreasing).
   - **Defection Threshold:** If more than 50% of players defected in the previous round, switch to Defect (D) in the current round. Additionally, defect if the stock is above 50% of capacity, ensuring sustainability.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), Cooperate to prevent depletion and allow recovery in subsequent rounds.
- **High Cooperation:** If fewer than 50% defected, continue Cooperating to maintain or increase the stock for future exploitation.

### Strategy Phases:

1. **Initial Phase:** Cooperate to build a high stock level.
2. **Adaptive Phase:** Adjust actions based on opponents' behavior and stock health.
3. **Endgame Phase:** Maximize immediate payoffs in the final round by defecting.

This strategy is robust, adapting to various opponent behaviors while balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_68 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we need a balanced approach that considers both immediate gains and long-term stock sustainability. The strategy should adapt based on observed behaviors and the current state of the stock.

### Strategy Design:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a high initial stock level and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Monitor Defection Rates**: Track the number of defections by other players over recent rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds). If more than half defected, switch to defecting.
3. **Stock Level Thresholds**: Cooperate if the current stock is above 75% of capacity and others have been cooperative. If the stock drops below 50%, defect to secure higher payoffs immediately.
4. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, always defect as there's no future benefit to preserving the stock.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    if not history:
        return "C"  # First round: Cooperate
    
    current_stock = history[-1].stock
    round_num = len(history) + 1

    if round_num == r:
        return "D"  # Last round: Defect

    k = min(3, round_num - 1)
    recent_actions = [action for player_actions in history[-k:] for action in player_actions]
    recent_defections = sum(1 for action in recent_actions if action == "D")
    avg_defection_rate = recent_defections / (n * k)

    if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
        return "D"
    elif avg_defection_rate > 0.5:
        return "D"
    else:
        # Check if stock is sufficiently high to sustain cooperation
        if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
            return "C"
        else:
            # Mixed strategy based on recent trends or other factors
            # Example: Cooperate with probability based on stock level
            # For simplicity, assume a threshold-based approach
            return "C" if current_stock > (capacity / 2) else "D"

    return "C"  # Default case, though should be covered above
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate to set a positive precedent and maximize initial payoffs.
- **Adaptive Monitoring**: Track recent defections. If more than half of the players have defected in the last few rounds, switch to defecting to avoid being exploited.
- **Stock Thresholds**: Use stock levels to decide actions—cooperate when the stock is healthy (above 75% of capacity) and others are cooperative; defect if the stock is low (below 50%) or many players have defected recently.
- **Final Round**: Defect in the last round since there's no future benefit to cooperation.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed behaviors and current stock levels.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_69 = '''
To address the problem of determining when to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in a multiplayer iterative game based on the Tragedy of the Commons scenario, we can outline a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The goal is to maximize individual payoffs while considering both the actions of others and the current state of the shared resource.

### Approach
The strategy is designed to be reactive yet forward-thinking, incorporating both historical actions of other players and the current state (stock level) to decide whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate. This sets an initial cooperative tone and maximizes the stock for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If it is not the last round, check two conditions:
     - **History of Defection**: Count how many players defected in the previous round. If more than half of the players defected (i.e., number of defectors ≥ n/2), then Defect in the current round.
     - **Current Stock Level**: If the current stock level is below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), Defect to secure higher immediate gains before the stock potentially depletes further.
   - If neither condition is met, Cooperate to maintain a healthy stock for future rounds.

3. **Last Round**: Always Defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences to consider.

This approach ensures that while we aim to cooperate when beneficial, we also protect our interests by defecting when others are not cooperating or when the resource is dwindling.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(round_number, total_rounds, previous_defectors, current_stock, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        n = len(previous_defectors)  # number of players
        threshold_defectors = n / 2
        stock_threshold = capacity / 2
        
        defectors_count = sum(1 for action in previous_defectors if action == 'D')
        
        if defectors_count >= threshold_defectors or current_stock < stock_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **First Round Cooperation**: By Cooperating initially, we start with the maximum possible stock, setting a foundation for potential future cooperation.
- **Reactive Strategy in Middle Rounds**: The strategy reacts to both the number of previous defectors and the current stock level. Defecting when others have defected or when the stock is low helps prevent being exploited and ensures immediate gains.
- **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, with no future rounds to worry about, defecting maximizes personal gain without concern for resource depletion in subsequent rounds.

This balanced approach aims to optimize payoffs by being cooperative when conditions are favorable and strategic in defecting when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_70 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Rounds (First 2 rounds):** Alternate between Cooperate (C) and Defect (D) to observe others' behavior without being predictable.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** Calculate the average consumption per player in previous rounds. If the average exceeds a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity/n), switch to Defecting to exploit others' cooperation. Otherwise, Cooperate to sustain resources.
   - **Late Game (Last 3 rounds):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoffs as future rounds are limited.

**2. Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Choose C to encourage initial cooperation and gauge others' responses.
   - **Low Stock (<20% of capacity):** Switch to D permanently to secure remaining resources.
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect to capture maximum possible payoff regardless of stock level.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
   The strategy adapts by monitoring collective consumption patterns, exploiting greedy behavior while sustaining resources when others cooperate. It doesn't rely on mutual cooperation but capitalizes on opponents' actions dynamically.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_71 = '''
To maximize your payoff while considering the potential actions of other players and the sustainability of the common resource (the stock level), the optimal strategy is:

1. **Cooperate** when the current stock level \( S \) is below 70% of the capacity \( C \).
2. **Defect** when the current stock level \( S \) is above 70% of the capacity \( C \).

This balanced approach allows you to exploit the resource when it's plentiful while conserving it when necessary, aiming for a sustainable outcome that considers both immediate gains and future depletion risks.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_72 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create a balanced approach that adapts based on the game's state and opponents' actions. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation and Defection (ACD)

1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation allows observation of other players' behaviors without immediately exploiting the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock level \( S \) is above 50% of the capacity, consider the resource healthy enough to sustain potential over-harvesting.
   - **Defector Threshold:** Calculate the number of defectors in the previous round. If more than half of the players defected, switch to defecting (D).
   - **Adaptive Decision:**
     - If \( S > \text{capacity}/2 \) and fewer than half defected last round, continue cooperating.
     - Otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff.

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to gauge others' strategies without immediate exploitation.
- **Stock Threshold:** Ensures that defection occurs when the stock can sustain it, preventing rapid depletion.
- **Defector Response:** Adapts to others' actions by defecting if many are already doing so, avoiding being exploited.

### Implementation:
1. Cooperate in the first round.
2. For each subsequent round, evaluate both the current stock level and the number of previous defectors to decide whether to cooperate or defect.

This strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable resource use, adapting dynamically based on observable game state factors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_73 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Levels**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of others' initial moves.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - After each round, evaluate the new stock level.
     - If the stock is below 25% of capacity, defect in the next round.
     - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, continue cooperating.
     - If the stock is between these thresholds, defect.

3. **Last Round Action (Round r)**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds don't exist.

**Rationale**: This strategy starts cooperatively to encourage sustainability but adapts by defecting when the stock indicates insufficient cooperation, thus exploiting others' behaviors while protecting against significant stock depletion. The final round defection ensures maximum short-term gain without concern for future consequences.

**Pseudocode Example**:

```
def adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        action = 'C'
    elif current_round == r:
        action = 'D'
    else:
        previous_stock = get_previous_stock()
        if previous_stock < (0.25 * capacity):
            action = 'D'
        elif previous_stock > (0.75 * capacity):
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'
    return action
```

This strategy balances cooperation and defection, adapting based on observed stock levels to exploit others' strategies while safeguarding against excessive depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_74 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a decision-making approach that maximizes individual payoffs while being adaptive to the actions of other players. The strategy must be robust to various behaviors and not rely on coordination or cooperation from others.

### 1. Decision Rules
The strategy is based on observing the stock's growth after each round and adjusting behavior accordingly:

- **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation allows us to observe the stock dynamics without immediately depleting it.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If the stock increased or stayed the same after the previous round, continue Cooperating. This indicates that others are likely cooperating, and maintaining a high stock benefits future payoffs.
  - If the stock decreased, Defect (D) in the next round. A decrease suggests that some players defected, so defecting can help capture a larger share before the stock is further depleted.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate to establish a baseline for stock growth.
- **Last Round**: Always Defect (D). In the final round, there’s no future stock to preserve, so maximize immediate payoff by taking a larger portion.

### 3. Exploitative Approach
The strategy aligns with an exploitative mindset by:
- Cooperating when others are likely cooperating to maintain a sustainable stock.
- Defecting when the stock decreases, indicating others are defecting, thus exploiting their behavior for personal gain without waiting to be exploited.

This approach balances cooperation and defection based on observed outcomes, ensuring adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_75 = '''
**Answer:**

To maximize your payoff while strategically managing the common resource, follow these steps:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate. This sets an initial cooperative tone and allows you to observe others' behavior without immediate risk.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate (ACR) of other players based on their past actions.
     - ACR = (Total number of times others Cooperated) / (Total possible actions by others)
   - If the current stock level (S) is below 20% of its capacity, choose to Cooperate. This helps replenish the stock for future rounds.
   - If S is above the threshold and ACR > 0.5, meaning most players are cooperating more than half the time, continue to Cooperate. This maintains the stock level and ensures sustainable future payoffs.
   - If ACR ≤ 0.5, indicating that others are not cooperating enough, choose to Defect. This allows you to exploit their lower cooperation for higher immediate gains.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Always Defect. Since there's no future round to preserve the stock for, prioritize maximizing your final payoff regardless of others' actions.

**Example Scenario**:

- If all other players consistently Cooperate:
  - You will initially Cooperate but switch to Defecting once their ACR is above 0.5.
  - Your Defection increases your payoffs each round while they continue to Cooperate, potentially depleting the stock over time.

- If most players are Defecting:
  - The ACR will be below 0.5, leading you to also Defect, accelerating stock depletion but maximizing immediate gains.

This strategy balances exploitation with resource management, ensuring you maximize your payoffs while maintaining the stock's viability for future rounds when beneficial.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_76 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to cooperate or defect in a common-pool resource game, we've considered various factors including the number of remaining rounds, the current stock level, and the cooperation rate of other players. The goal is to balance maximizing immediate payoffs while preserving the resource for future use. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage initial cooperation among players.
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players in previous rounds.
   - If both conditions are met:
     a) The average cooperation rate is above 50%.
     b) The current stock level is above capacity/2.
     Then, cooperate.
   - Otherwise, defect.
3. **Last Round (Round r):** Always defect to maximize the immediate payoff since there's no future benefit to preserving the stock.

### Explanation:
- **First Round Cooperation:** Sets a cooperative tone, increasing the likelihood that others will also cooperate, thus maintaining a healthy stock level for future rounds.
- **Adaptive Decision in Middle Rounds:** By considering both the cooperation rate and current stock level, the strategy ensures that cooperation is only continued when it's mutually beneficial and sustainable. Defecting becomes the choice when either others aren't cooperating enough or the stock is at risk of depletion.
- **Last Round Defection:** Maximizes immediate gain since there are no future consequences to consider after the last round.

This approach balances individual gain with resource preservation, adapting dynamically based on the behavior of other players and the state of the resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_77 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, I propose a dynamic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy adapts based on observed behavior and stock dynamics, ensuring robustness against various opponent actions.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a high initial stock level, promoting sustainability from the outset.

2. **Monitor Stock Dynamics and Opponent Actions:**
   - Track the stock's trend over time. If it shows a consistent decline despite cooperation, switch to defection.
   - Observe opponents' actions. If a significant number (e.g., more than half) defected in previous rounds, adjust by defecting more frequently.

3. **Threshold-Based Adaptation:**
   - Define thresholds for stock levels relative to capacity and the proportion of opponents defecting. Switch strategies when these thresholds are crossed.

4. **Last Round Defection:**
   - In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock sustainability.

5. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Use historical data on stock levels and opponent actions to identify trends. Adjust strategy preemptively if a negative trend is detected.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(game_params, game_state, history):
    n = game_params['n']
    r = game_params['r']
    capacity = game_params['capacity']
    current_round = game_state['round']
    stock = game_state['stock']
    previous_actions = history['previous_actions']

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        stock_trend = calculate_stock_trend(history)
        defect_rate = calculate_defect_rate(previous_actions)

        if current_round == r:
            return 'D'  # Defect in the last round
        elif stock < 0.5 * capacity and defect_rate > 0.5:
            return 'D'  # Switch to defection if stock is low and many defect
        else:
            if stock_trend == 'declining':
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'

def calculate_stock_trend(history):
    # Implement trend analysis based on historical stock levels
    pass

def calculate_defect_rate(previous_actions):
    # Calculate the rate of defection among opponents
    pass
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to build a strong foundation for future rounds.
- **Adaptive Switching:** Monitors both stock health and opponent behavior, switching strategies when necessary to prevent depletion or exploit others' greed.
- **Thresholds:** Uses defined thresholds to objectively decide strategy changes, ensuring responsiveness without being overly reactive.
- **Final Round Maximization:** Defects in the last round to secure maximum personal gain, as future sustainability is no longer a concern.

This strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection dynamically, adapting to game dynamics while exploiting opponents' tendencies for optimal payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_78 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game with an exploitative strategy that adapts to opponents' behaviors and ensures robustness across various scenarios, we can structure our approach as follows:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation with Forgiveness (AEF)

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a cooperative tone and maximize initial stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Defection Rate**: Track the number of players defecting in recent rounds, using a moving average (e.g., last 3 rounds).
   - **Adaptive Thresholds**: 
     - **Defection Threshold**: If the average defection rate exceeds 50%, switch to defecting for a set period (e.g., 3 rounds) to deter exploitation.
     - **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After punishing, if others cooperate consistently, revert to cooperation.
   - **Sustainability Check**: Continuously monitor stock levels. If stock falls below a critical level (e.g., 25% of capacity), defect to maximize immediate gains.

3. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final round, defect to secure maximum payoff since future consequences are irrelevant.

### Detailed Decision Rules

1. **First Round**:
   - Action: Cooperate (C).

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - Calculate the average defection rate over the last few rounds.
     - If the rate is above a threshold, defect for a set period.
     - Incorporate stock level checks to prevent over-depletion.

3. **Last Round (r)**:
   - Action: Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

### Handling Edge Cases

- **Low Stock Levels**: If stock is critically low, prioritize immediate gain by defecting.
- **Sudden Cooperation**: If opponents shift to cooperation after punishment, adapt by returning to cooperation.

### Pseudocode Example

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(current_stock, history, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    recent_defections = count_defections(history, lookback=3)
    avg_defection_rate = recent_defections / len(history)
    
    if avg_defection_rate > 0.5 and not in_punishment_phase:
        start_punishment()
        return 'D'
    elif in_punishment_phase and punishment_rounds_exceeded:
        stop_punishment()
        return 'C' if recent_cooperations else 'D'
    
    if current_stock < critical_threshold:
        return 'D'
    
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    # Forgiveness mechanism
    if recent_defections == 0:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Adaptive threshold check
        if avg_defection_rate > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

# Helper functions: count_defections, start_punishment, etc.
```

### Conclusion

This strategy balances cooperation and defection by adapting to the dynamics of the game, ensuring long-term sustainability while exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs when beneficial. It is robust against various opponent strategies and handles edge cases effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_79 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a dynamic and adaptive approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy is designed to exploit opponents' behaviors while maintaining the resource's health.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability (AES)

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline and observe others' actions, promoting potential mutual cooperation.

2. **Monitor Opponents' Behavior**: Track each opponent's historical actions over the past few rounds. This informs decisions on whether to cooperate or defect based on their tendencies.

3. **Reciprocal Response Mechanism**:
   - **Cooperate** if a majority of opponents have cooperated in recent rounds, fostering continued cooperation.
   - **Defect** if there's a noticeable trend towards defection among opponents, to avoid being exploited and maximize payoffs.

4. **Stock-Level Adaptation**: Adjust actions based on the current stock level:
   - If the stock is low (below a threshold, e.g., 25% of capacity), cooperate to conserve and allow replenishment.
   - If the stock is sufficient, defect to increase immediate payoffs without significant risk to future sustainability.

5. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final rounds, prioritize maximizing immediate gains by defecting, as there's no future punishment to fear.

### Decision Rules:

- **First Round**: Cooperate (C).
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Calculate the average cooperation rate of opponents over the last few rounds.
  - If opponents' average cooperation is above a threshold (e.g., 50%), cooperate; otherwise, defect.
  - Adjust based on stock level: Cooperate if stock is below a conservation threshold, else defect.

### Edge Case Handling:

- **Low Stock**: Switch to cooperation to allow stock replenishment.
- **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

This strategy combines reciprocity with adaptive behavior, aiming to exploit opponents' actions while preserving the resource for sustained play.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_80 = '''
To design an effective exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we need a balance between cooperating to maintain the stock and defecting to maximize individual payoffs. The strategy should adapt based on the current state of the stock and the history of other players' actions.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and History

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to start with a high stock level, encouraging others to cooperate and building a foundation for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: Define a threshold T as half of the maximum capacity (T = 0.5 * capacity). If the current stock S_t is below this threshold, defect in this round.
   - **Defection Rate Monitoring**: Calculate the average defection rate (D_avg) across all players from previous rounds. If D_avg exceeds 50%, defect to exploit others' tendency towards defection.
   - If neither condition is met, cooperate to sustain the stock.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Always defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future consequences for stock depletion.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1  # Assuming history is a list of past actions per round
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    T = 0.5 * capacity
    S_t = get_current_stock()  # Function to retrieve current stock level
    
    total_defections = sum([sum(round) for round in history])  # Count total D's across all players and rounds
    D_avg = total_defections / (n * (current_round - 1))  # Average defection rate
    
    if S_t < T or D_avg > 0.5:
        return 'D'  # Defect if stock is below threshold or high defection rate
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate otherwise
    
    if current_round == r:  # Last round
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation

- **First Round**: By cooperating, we set a positive precedent and maintain the stock at its maximum.
- **Stock Threshold (T)**: If the stock falls below half of capacity, defecting ensures that we capture as much value as possible before potential depletion.
- **Defection Rate (D_avg)**: Monitoring others' defection rates allows us to adapt. If many are defecting, it's strategic to join them to avoid being exploited.
- **Final Round**: Maximizing immediate gain is optimal in the last round since there’s no future impact on the stock.

This strategy balances cooperation and exploitation, ensuring we maintain the stock when possible while strategically defecting to maximize payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_81 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a balanced approach that adapts based on opponents' actions and the current stock level. The strategy aims to maximize payoffs by exploiting others while maintaining resource sustainability.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to observe other players' behaviors without immediately depleting the resource.
2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - In each subsequent round, evaluate the number of defectors from the previous round and the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If more than 30% of players defected in the last round or if the stock falls below 60% of its capacity, switch to defecting to exploit others' actions or prevent further depletion.
   - Otherwise, continue cooperating to sustain the resource for future rounds.

### Strategy Details:
- **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline and observe others' strategies.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Monitor the previous round's defection rate and current stock level.
  - Use thresholds to decide actions: defect if more than 30% defected or stock is below 60% of capacity; otherwise, cooperate.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity):
    # Initialize cooperation
    history = []
    for t in range(1, r+1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            prev_actions = history[-1]
            prev_defections = sum(1 for a in prev_actions if a == 'D')
            stock_level = current_stock / capacity
            if (prev_defections / n) > 0.3 or stock_level < 0.6:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'
        history.append(action)
        # Update based on game state
    return action
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, the strategy gathers initial data on others' actions without immediately impacting the stock negatively.
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: The use of 30% and 60% thresholds allows the strategy to respond to both increased defection rates and significant stock depletion, balancing exploitation with sustainability.
- **Robustness**: This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors, adapting to exploit when possible while conserving resources when necessary.

This strategy effectively balances immediate gains with long-term resource management, aiming to maximize total payoff over the game's duration.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_82 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round to maximize overall payoff while maintaining stock levels for future rounds, we can use a straightforward deterministic strategy based on the current stock level relative to half of the capacity. This approach ensures that we exploit when there's plenty and conserve when necessary.

### Approach
1. **First Round**: Always cooperate to start with a high stock level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If the current stock is greater than half of the capacity, defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to help maintain or replenish the stock for future rounds.

This strategy balances between taking advantage of abundant resources and preserving them when they become scarce.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "COOPERATE"
    elif current_stock > (capacity / 2):
        return "DEFECT"
    else:
        return "COOPERATE"

# Example usage in a loop over rounds
# for t in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
#     action = decide_action(t, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity)
#     # Update stock based on action and others' actions
```

### Explanation
- **First Round Action**: By cooperating initially, we ensure the stock remains at its maximum level for the first round.
- **Subsequent Rounds**: 
  - If the stock is above half of the capacity, defecting increases immediate payoff without significantly risking future rounds.
  - When the stock falls to or below half, cooperation helps in preserving the stock, ensuring that there are sufficient resources left for future exploitation.

This approach is simple yet effective, providing a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_83 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation for Sustainable Resource Management**

1. **Initial Cooperation Phase (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline of behavior and observe others' actions without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Adaptive Threshold Strategy (Subsequent Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - After the initial phase, decide whether to Cooperate or Defect based on the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - **Defect** if the stock is above 70% of capacity: This allows taking a larger share while ensuring there's enough stock left for growth and future rounds.
     - **Cooperate** if the stock is below 70% of capacity: This helps in conserving and allowing the stock to recover, preventing rapid depletion.

3. **Endgame Strategy (Final Round):**
   - In the last round, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future round to consider post-depletion consequences.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If the stock is near zero, switch to Cooperation to allow growth for potential future rounds.
   - Continuously monitor others' actions and adjust the threshold as needed based on observed behavior patterns.

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a cooperative tone and provides data on other players' tendencies.
- **Adaptive Threshold:** Balances exploitation with sustainability, adjusting strategy based on stock health.
- **Endgame Defection:** Maximizes immediate gain when future consequences are irrelevant.
- **Edge Case Management:** Ensures strategic flexibility to adapt to extreme conditions.

This strategy aims to exploit others' cooperation while safeguarding against resource depletion, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_84 = '''
To determine whether to cooperate or defect in each round of the game, follow these steps:

1. **First Round:** Always choose to Defect. This allows you to exploit the maximum possible benefit at the start when the stock is full.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the current stock level at the beginning of the round.
   - If the current stock is above 75% of its maximum capacity, continue to Defect to maximize your gain while the stock can sustain higher consumption without significant depletion.
   - If the current stock drops below or equals 75% of its maximum capacity, switch to Cooperate. This action helps in replenishing the stock, ensuring that it doesn't deplete too much for future rounds.

By following this strategy, you balance exploiting the resource when it's abundant and conserving it when necessary, aiming to maximize your overall payoff throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_85 = '''
To maximize your payoff in this scenario, you should adopt a responsive strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on others' behavior. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to contribute to a high initial stock level.

2. **Monitor Others' Actions**: After each round, observe other players' payoffs to determine how many cooperated or defected.

3. **Set a Defection Threshold**: Define a threshold, such as if more than half of the players defected in the previous round, you will defect in the current round. Adjust this threshold based on game dynamics and your risk tolerance.

4. **Adjust Strategy Dynamically**: If the number of defectors exceeds your threshold, switch to defecting to capture more payoff before the stock depletes further. If not, continue cooperating to maintain a high stock level for future rounds.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically evaluate the effectiveness of your strategy and adjust the threshold as needed based on observed outcomes and stock trends.

By following this approach, you can strategically decide when to cooperate and when to defect, maximizing your payoff while considering others' behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_86 = '''
To address the problem of determining an effective strategy for playing the game described, we can structure our approach based on observed behavior and stock levels. The goal is to maximize individual payoff while maintaining a sustainable stock level for future rounds. Here's how the strategy is formulated:

### Strategy Formulation:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round. This helps establish a high initial stock level, encouraging others to cooperate as well.
2. **Monitor Past Behavior and Stock Levels**:
   - In each subsequent round, observe how many players defected in the previous round (denoted as \( D_{t-1} \)).
   - Check the current stock level (\( S_t \)) relative to the capacity.
3. **Decision Making**:
   - If fewer than 25% of the players defected last round (\( D_{t-1} < 0.25n \)) and the current stock is above half the capacity (\( S_t > 0.5C \)), choose to defect this round.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to help maintain or rebuild the stock level.

### Strategy Summary:
- **Round 1**: Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If \( D_{t-1} < 0.25n \) and \( S_t > 0.5C \), defect.
  - Else, cooperate.

This strategy balances exploiting opportunities when it's safe (others are mostly cooperating and stock is high) while conserving resources when necessary to prevent depletion.

### Answer:
The optimal strategy involves initially cooperating, then defecting only when others are mostly cooperative and the stock is sufficiently high. The final answer is:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate in the first round; thereafter, defect if fewer than 25\% defected last round and current stock exceeds half capacity, else cooperate.}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_87 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round for maximizing personal payoff while considering the sustainability of the resource, we can outline a structured approach based on observations and heuristics. This strategy balances cooperation with the need to defect when others appear to be over-exploiting the resource.

### Strategy Outline

1. **First Round:** Cooperate.
   - **Action:** Choose C (Cooperate).
   - **Reasoning:** Start by cooperating to attempt establishing a sustainable use pattern, ensuring the stock doesn't deplete too quickly.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   - **Observation:** Monitor the stock level at the end of each round.
   - **Threshold Check:** If the stock drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch strategy to defecting in subsequent rounds.
     - **Action if Below Threshold:** Choose D (Defect) for this round and possibly continue until the stock recovers.
   - **Consumption Inference:** If the stock remains above the threshold, estimate the total consumption from the previous round:
     - Calculate whether the inferred total consumption (T_prev) exceeds half of the previous stock level (S_prev / 2).
       - If T_prev > S_prev / 2: Choose D for this round.
       - Else: Continue cooperating by choosing C.

3. **Last Round:** Always Defect.
   - **Action:** Choose D to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Explanation of the Strategy

- **Cooperation in Early Rounds:** Starting with cooperation encourages others to do the same, potentially maintaining a stable stock level through regeneration.
  
- **Threshold-Based Defection:** If the stock drops significantly (e.g., below 50% of capacity), it indicates over-exploitation. Defecting helps secure personal gain before the resource is depleted further.

- **Inferred Consumption Check:** By estimating whether previous total consumption exceeded a cooperative share, the strategy identifies potential over-exploitation by others and responds defensively by defecting to capture a larger portion of the remaining stock.

- **Final Round Defection:** In the last round, with no future consequences, maximizing immediate gain is optimal regardless of prior actions.

This approach adaptively balances between maintaining resource sustainability through cooperation and strategically defecting when necessary to protect or maximize individual gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_88 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that considers both immediate gains and long-term sustainability. The strategy should adapt based on the actions of others and the current state of the stock. Here's a structured plan:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Sustainability

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation sets a baseline, allowing observation of other players' behaviors without immediately exploiting.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - After each round, calculate the total consumption from the previous round.
   - If the total consumption exceeds half of the stock before that round (S_prev / 2), defect in the current round.
     - This threshold indicates that collective actions were unsustainable, suggesting over-harvesting by other players.
   - If the total consumption was within sustainable levels (≤ S_prev / 2), continue cooperating.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Always Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds to consider, maximizing immediate payoff is optimal without concern for stock depletion consequences.

### Rationale

- **Sustainability Check**: By comparing total consumption to half the previous stock level, we determine if collective actions were sustainable. Exceeding this threshold signals potential over-exploitation by others.
  
- **Adaptation**: The strategy dynamically adjusts based on recent behavior and stock health, ensuring responsiveness without rigid assumptions about others' strategies.

- **Exploitative Mindset**: Cooperating when others conserve but defecting when they over-harvest allows us to exploit their cooperation while avoiding being exploited ourselves.

This approach balances immediate gains with sustainability, adapting effectively to the dynamic environment of the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_89 = '''
To address the problem, we'll design a strategic approach that adaptively responds to both the stock level and the actions of other players. The strategy aims to balance cooperation with the need to avoid exploitation.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Strategy**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same, promoting resource sustainability.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels and Trends**: After each round, observe the stock level and its trend over time. If the stock falls below 50% of capacity or shows a significant decreasing trend, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds.

3. **Defection in Last Round**: In the final round, always defect since there's no future benefit from maintaining the stock beyond that point.

**Pseudocode:**

```
parameters:
    n (number of players)
    r (number of rounds)
    capacity (maximum stock level)

state variables:
    current_stock = capacity
    previous_stocks = [capacity]

strategy:

for round in 1 to r:
    if round == 1 or round == last_round:
        action = D if round == last_round else C
    else:
        check trend of previous_stocks
        if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity or stock_trend is significantly decreasing:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C

    take_action(action)
    update previous_stocks with new stock level after this round's actions and growth
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, we set a precedent that may encourage others to reciprocate, maintaining a healthy stock.
  
- **Adaptive Response**: Monitoring the stock ensures that if depletion is too rapid or significant, the strategy shifts to defecting. This prevents being exploited by others who may choose to defect.
  
- **Endgame Defection**: In the last round, there's no incentive to maintain cooperation since future consequences are irrelevant. Defecting maximizes immediate payoff.

This approach effectively balances sustainability with self-interest, adapting dynamically based on observed game state and trends.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_90 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource game, we've developed a strategic approach that balances cooperation with exploitation, adapting to both the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Conservation

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C). This encourages initial sustainability and observes others' behavior without immediate depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Count Defections**: Track the number of players who defected in the previous round (D_count).
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: If the current stock is below a conservative threshold (e.g., capacity/2), Cooperate to aid replenishment.
   - **Defection Trigger**: If D_count exceeds half the number of players (n/2), Defect to protect against excessive depletion.
   - **Default Action**: If neither condition is met, Cooperate to maintain stock sustainability.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**:
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as there's no future impact on the stock.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round, total_rounds, prev_actions):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Count number of defectors in previous round
        D_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
        
        # Determine if it's the last round
        is_last_round = (round == total_rounds)
        
        # Stock threshold for conservation (e.g., half of capacity)
        stock_threshold = capacity / 2
        
        if current_stock < stock_threshold:
            return 'C'
        elif D_count > n/2 or is_last_round:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to foster a sustainable environment and gather initial data on others' strategies.
- **Adaptive Response**: Adjusts based on the number of defectors, switching to defection if cooperation isn't reciprocated sufficiently, preventing undue exploitation by others.
- **Stock Conservation**: Prioritizes stock replenishment when levels are low, ensuring future rounds have sufficient resources.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Maximizes payoff in the final round without concern for future depletion.

This strategy is designed to be robust and exploitative, adapting dynamically to maintain a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_91 = '''
To design an effective exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that adapts to the behavior of other players while maximizing our own payoff. The strategy should be robust to various opponent behaviors and dynamically adjust based on the game's state and history.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability Awareness

1. **Initial Cooperation (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating in the first round to observe the behavior of other players and gather initial data on their actions without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Opponents' Behavior:** Calculate the average consumption per player in previous rounds. If the average consumption is above a threshold (e.g., 1.5 times the cooperative share), infer that many players are defecting.
   - **Stock Level Check:** Continuously monitor the current stock level. If it falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), prioritize defecting to maximize immediate gain before potential depletion.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - **Defect if Others Defect:** If the majority of players are defecting, switch to defecting to avoid being exploited.
   - **Cooperate if Others Cooperate:** If most players cooperate, continue cooperating to sustain the stock for future rounds while maintaining a moderate payoff.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - **Last Few Rounds:** As the game nears its end (e.g., last 20% of rounds), increase the tendency to defect to maximize immediate payoffs, as future sustainability becomes less relevant.

5. **Sustainability vs. Exploitation Balance:**
   - **Sustain Moderately:** If the stock is at a moderate level and opponents are mixed in their actions, balance between cooperating and defecting based on recent trends to maintain a sustainable stock while exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, current_stock, history, current_round, total_rounds):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate average consumption per player in previous rounds
    avg_consumption = calculate_average_consumption(history)
    
    # Determine if stock is critically low
    critical_threshold = 0.2 * capacity
    if current_stock < critical_threshold:
        return "D"
    
    # Assess opponent behavior
    defecting_players = count_defecting_players(history[-1])
    if defecting_players > n / 2:
        return "D"
    
    # Consider remaining rounds for endgame strategy
    if current_round > 0.8 * total_rounds:
        return "D"
    
    # Default to cooperation unless conditions met
    return "C"

def calculate_average_consumption(history):
    total = sum([sum(actions) for actions in history])
    return total / (len(history) * n)

def count_defecting_players(last_actions):
    return sum(1 for action in last_actions if action == "D")
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, we gather initial data on opponents' tendencies without immediate depletion.
- **Adaptive Monitoring:** Continuous assessment of both stock levels and opponent actions allows the strategy to dynamically adjust, defecting when exploitation is beneficial and cooperating to sustain resources when possible.
- **Endgame Focus:** As the game progresses, the strategy shifts towards maximizing immediate gains, ensuring that we secure higher payoffs in later rounds even if it means depleting the stock.

This approach ensures a balance between exploiting opponents' behavior for immediate benefits while maintaining awareness of the need for sustainability to ensure long-term payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_92 = '''
To solve this problem, we need to determine an optimal strategy for a player in a repeated game where each player can either Cooperate (C) or Defect (D). The goal is to maximize the player's payoff while considering the actions of other players and the state of a shared resource (stock).

### Approach
The strategy is designed to balance cooperation and exploitation based on the behavior of other players and the current state of the stock. Here are the key components:

1. **Average Cooperation Rate (ACR):** Calculate the average rate at which all players, including oneself, have chosen to cooperate in previous rounds. This helps gauge how cooperative the group has been historically.

2. **Stock Threshold:** If the current stock level is above a certain threshold (50% of the initial capacity), it indicates that the resource is still plentiful enough to warrant cooperation, assuming others are also cooperating.

3. **Defection Trigger:** If the historical cooperation rate falls below a certain threshold (70%) or if the stock drops below 50%, the strategy shifts towards defection to maximize immediate payoffs and avoid being exploited by others' potential defections.

4. **Final Round Defection:** In the last round, regardless of previous actions, the player will always defect to secure the maximum possible payoff since there are no future consequences for cooperation.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(t, r, S_t, capacity, past_actions):
    """
    Determine whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round t.
    
    Parameters:

    - r: total number of rounds
    - S_t: current stock level at the start of round t
    - capacity: maximum possible stock level
    - past_actions: list of lists where each sublist contains the actions ('C' or 'D') of all players in previous rounds
    
    Returns:
    - action: 'C' or 'D'
    """
    
    if t == r:
        # Always defect in the last round
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate Average Cooperation Rate (ACR) from past actions
    total_cooperations = 0
    for prev_round_actions in past_actions[:t-1]:  # only consider rounds before t
        total_cooperations += sum(1 for action in prev_round_actions if action == 'C')
    
    ACR = total_cooperations / (len(past_actions[:t-1]) * len(past_actions[0])) if past_actions else 0.0
    
    stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    cooperation_threshold = 0.7
    
    if ACR > cooperation_threshold and S_t > stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage in a loop over rounds:
past_actions = []  # Initialize with no past actions
for t in range(1, r+1):
    action = determine_action(t, r, S_t, capacity, past_actions)
    # Update past_actions with the current round's actions (assuming all players' actions are known after each round)
    # For simplicity, assume 'action' is added to a list of this round's actions
    # After all players have acted, append the list of their actions to past_actions
    # ... rest of game loop ...
```

### Explanation
- **Average Cooperation Rate (ACR):** This metric helps determine how cooperative other players have been in previous rounds. A high ACR indicates that most players are cooperating, making it beneficial to continue cooperating.
  
- **Stock Threshold:** By checking if the stock is above 50% of its initial capacity, we ensure that there's enough resource to sustain future rounds if others continue to cooperate.

- **Defection Strategy:** If cooperation drops below a certain level or the stock becomes depleted, switching to defection helps maximize immediate gains and prevents being taken advantage of by others who might be defecting more frequently.

- **Final Round Defection:** In the last round, there’s no future consequence for defecting, so it's optimal to secure the highest possible payoff by choosing D.

This strategy balances between maintaining cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary, ensuring a robust approach in dynamic scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_93 = '''
To address the problem of designing an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a dynamic approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observed behavior and stock conditions. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining the sustainability of the common resource.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first few rounds to encourage trust and observe other players' actions.
2. **Monitor Behavior**: Track the number of defectors each round. If a significant proportion (e.g., more than 50%) defect, switch to defection to protect your share.
3. **Last Round Exploitation**: Always defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.
4. **Stock Threshold Response**: If the stock falls below a critical level, switch to defection to prevent further depletion and secure remaining resources.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    if current_round == 1 or len(history) < 3:
        return "C"  # Cooperate initially
    
    last_actions = [action for action in history[-n:]]
    defectors = sum(1 for a in last_actions if a == "D")
    
    if current_round == r:

    if stock < capacity * 0.3:

    if defectors / n > 0.5:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"
```

### Strategy Explanation:
1. **Initial Rounds**: The strategy starts with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and observe others' behavior, crucial for informed decision-making in subsequent rounds.
2. **Behavior Monitoring**: By tracking the number of defectors each round, the strategy adapts by switching to defection when it detects significant exploitation, preventing being taken advantage of.
3. **Last Round Focus**: In the final round, the strategy prioritizes immediate gain by defecting, as there are no future consequences for stock depletion beyond that point.
4. **Stock Protection**: A critical stock threshold ensures that if resources become scarce, the strategy shifts to defection to secure remaining benefits before potential depletion.

This approach ensures adaptability and robustness, aligning with an exploitative mindset to maximize individual payoffs while dynamically responding to both opponent behavior and resource conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_94 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, I have developed a comprehensive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observed behavior and game state. This strategy is adaptive, robust, and aligned with an exploitative mindset.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Historical Behavior

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to establish a high initial stock level and encourage others to do the same.
- **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):** 
  - Calculate the average number of defectors from all previous rounds.
  - If this average exceeds half of the total players (n/2), switch to Defecting (D) in the current round. This threshold ensures that if a majority are defecting, you join them to avoid being exploited.
- **Last Round (r):** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact on the stock.

This approach allows the strategy to adapt based on historical actions, promoting cooperation initially but switching to defection when others exploit excessively. It prevents being taken advantage of while ensuring you capture as much value as possible in the final round.

### Handling Edge Cases:
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is critically low (e.g., below 10% of capacity), consider cooperating to allow recovery, unless others are defecting heavily.
- **Stock Growth Monitoring:** Continuously observe how the stock regrows after each round. Adjust your strategy dynamically if the stock isn't sustaining at a viable level for future rounds.

### Exploitative Alignment:
The strategy clearly aligns with an exploitative mindset by monitoring opponents' actions and adapting accordingly. It capitalizes on their greed when prevalent, ensuring you maximize your payoff without being a "sucker" who cooperates while others defect.

This approach ensures sustainability and adaptability, making it robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors in the tournament setting.

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and maintain a high initial stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Level Check**: After each round, if the remaining stock is below 50% of capacity, switch to Defecting in the next round.
   - **Opponent Behavior Check**: If more than half of the players Defected in the previous round, switch to Defecting this round.
   - If neither condition is met, continue Cooperating.

3. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last few rounds (e.g., the final 2-3 rounds), always choose to Defect to maximize immediate payoffs, as future consequences are less significant.

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with Cooperation helps maintain a high stock level, which is beneficial for all players in the long run.
  
- **Adaptive Response**: By monitoring the stock level and others' actions, the strategy adjusts to prevent over-depletion. If the stock drops below a sustainable threshold or if many others are Defecting, it's rational to switch strategies to avoid being exploited.

- **Endgame Focus**: In later rounds, prioritizing immediate gains ensures maximum personal payoff without concern for future depletion effects.

This approach aims to balance cooperation and self-interest dynamically, ensuring both sustainability and strategic advantage.

To address the challenge of designing an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create a balanced approach that adapts to the game's state and history while maximizing payoffs.

### Strategy Overview
The strategy is designed to be exploitative, focusing on maximizing individual payoff by observing and responding to both the stock level and opponents' actions. It balances cooperation and defection to maintain stock health while exploiting opportunities for higher gains when possible.

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a baseline, allowing observation of other players' initial moves without depleting the stock unnecessarily.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Stock Level:** Track the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If the stock is below 25% of capacity, defect to secure immediate gains before potential depletion.
   - **Observe Opponents' Previous Actions:**
     - Cooperate if most opponents cooperated in the previous round, encouraging sustainability.
     - Defect if a significant number defected previously, avoiding being exploited.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Since there are no future rounds, maximize immediate payoff without concern for stock replenishment.

### Edge Cases and Considerations

- **Stock Thresholds:**
  - If the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 25% of capacity), prioritize defection to secure remaining resources.
  
- **Opponents' Behavior:**
  - Use the majority action from the previous round to inform current decisions, adapting strategy based on observed cooperation or defection trends.

### Strategy Implementation

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set initial action to Cooperate for Round 1.

2. **Iterative Decision-Making:**
   - For each subsequent round, evaluate the stock level and opponents' previous actions.
   - Adjust strategy accordingly: defect if stock is low or if opponents defected; otherwise, cooperate.

3. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - Switch to Defect in the last round to maximize immediate payoff.

This approach ensures adaptability and robustness, responding effectively to both environmental (stock level) and social (opponents' actions) dynamics, thereby optimizing individual payoffs throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_97 = '''
To determine whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round of the game, follow these steps based on the current stock level and the number of remaining rounds:

1. **Identify Total Rounds (r):** Know the total number of rounds in the game.

2. **Last Round Decision:** In the final round (t = r), always choose to Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to preserve stock for.

3. **Calculate Threshold for Each Round:**
   - For each round t from 1 to r-1, compute the threshold T(t) using the formula:
     \[
     T(t) = \text{capacity} \times \frac{(r - t + 1)}{2r}
     \]
   - This threshold decreases as the game progresses, encouraging preservation of stock in earlier rounds and allowing exploitation as the end nears.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - If the current stock level is greater than T(t), choose to Defect.
   - If the current stock level is less than or equal to T(t), choose to Cooperate to preserve stock for future rounds.

**Example Calculation:**

- Suppose capacity = 100 and r = 10 rounds.
- In Round 1:
  \[
  T(1) = 100 \times \frac{(10 - 1 + 1)}{2 \times 10} = 100 \times \frac{10}{20} = 50
  \]
  If stock > 50, Defect; else, Cooperate.

- In Round 5:
  \[
  T(5) = 100 \times \frac{(10 - 5 + 1)}{20} = 100 \times \frac{6}{20} = 30
  \]
  If stock > 30, Defect; else, Cooperate.

- In Round 10:
  Always Defect regardless of stock level.

This strategy balances between exploiting the stock when it's sufficiently abundant and preserving it when necessary to ensure sustainable future payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_98 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round of the game, we can use a hybrid approach that combines considerations of social cooperation and resource sustainability. The strategy is designed to encourage cooperation when beneficial while switching to defection when necessary to maximize payoffs.

### Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - Always Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation aims to establish a cooperative tone and observe others' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (from Round 2 to Round r-1):**
   - **Calculate the Average Cooperation Rate (ACR):** Compute the average number of times all players, including yourself, have chosen to Cooperate in previous rounds.
   - **Determine Stock Threshold (S_safe):** Set a safe stock level as half of the capacity, S_safe = capacity / 2.
   - **Decision Making:**
     - If ACR > 0.5 (more than half of all actions were Cooperations) and current_stock > S_safe:
       - Choose to Cooperate (C). This continues support for a sustainable resource while encouraging others' cooperation.
     - Else:
       - Choose to Defect (D). This maximizes immediate payoffs when cooperation isn't sustainably maintaining the stock.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Always Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds, prioritize maximizing your final payoff without concern for resource sustainability.

### Edge Cases and Considerations:
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock ever drops to zero before the last round, subsequent rounds will yield zero payoffs regardless of actions. Thus, preventing stock depletion is crucial in earlier rounds.
- **High Capacity Relative to n:** If capacity is significantly higher than the number of players (n), the strategy may lean more towards cooperation as the resource can sustain more depletion.

### Rationale:
This approach balances between encouraging cooperative behavior for long-term sustainability and defecting when immediate gains are more advantageous. By monitoring past actions and current stock levels, the strategy adaptively switches modes to optimize outcomes in both cooperative and exploitative environments.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_99 = '''
To design an effective exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create a dynamic approach that adapts based on game state and history. The strategy balances cooperation to sustain resources with opportunistic defection to maximize payoffs.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Encourage resource sustainability and set a cooperative precedent, promoting higher long-term payoffs.

2. **Monitor Stock Trend:**
   - Track the stock level over previous rounds to detect depletion trends.
   - If the stock shows a significant downward trend, indicating potential exploitation by others, switch strategies.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Implement a trigger strategy:
     - **Action:** Cooperate if the stock is stable or increasing.
     - **Action:** Defect (D) for 1-2 rounds if the stock decreases significantly.
   - Post-punishment, revert to cooperation to encourage others back.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In later rounds, especially near the end:
     - **Action:** Cooperate if sufficient stock remains.
     - **Action:** Defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff.

### Detailed Decision Rules

1. **First Round:**
   - Always cooperate to establish cooperation and maintain initial stock levels.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate average stock change over the last few rounds.
   - If the stock decreases by more than a threshold (e.g., 10%), defect in the next round to punish defectors and prevent depletion.

3. **Post-Punishment:**
   - After defecting, monitor if cooperation resumes. If stock begins to recover, revert to cooperation.

4. **Endgame:**
   - In the last round, defect to maximize payoff regardless of stock impact since there are no future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def strategy(history, state, parameters):
    n = parameters['n']
    r = parameters['rounds']
    capacity = parameters['capacity']
    current_stock = state['stock']
    
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return 'C'
    else:
        previous_stock = history[-1]['stock_after']
        stock_change = current_stock - previous_stock
        
        if stock_change < -threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    if current_round >= r - 1:  # Last round
        return 'D'

    cooperation_threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    if current_stock > cooperation_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Key Features

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a cooperative tone to encourage sustainability.
- **Adaptive Punishment:** Defects when stock trends downward, discouraging exploitation by others.
- **Endgame Maximization:** Secures maximum payoff in the final rounds without concern for future consequences.

This strategy is designed to be robust against various behaviors, balancing cooperation with strategic defection to exploit opportunities while maintaining resource sustainability.

**Explanation:**

- **First Round:** Starts with Cooperation to avoid early depletion and observe others' behavior.
- **Last Round:** Defects to maximize immediate gain without future consequences.
- **Stock Conservation:** Cooperates if stock is critically low to ensure resource availability in future rounds.
- **Defection Threshold:** Switches to Defecting if majority of players exploited previously, preventing being taken advantage of.
- **Payoff-Based Cooperation:** Continues Cooperating only if average payoffs indicate sustainable use, balancing exploitation with conservation.

This strategy adaptively responds to both the game's state and opponents' actions, aiming to exploit when beneficial while conserving resources when necessary.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_101 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that maximizes immediate payoffs while ensuring the sustainability of the common pool over multiple rounds. The strategy must adapt based on observed outcomes without relying on cooperation from others.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Levels

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - Start by cooperating to establish a baseline stock level and observe the initial impact on the common pool.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - Calculate the average stock level from all previous rounds.
   - If the average stock level is above 75% of the capacity, choose to Defect (D) to exploit the abundant resource.
   - If the average stock level is below or equal to 75%, Cooperate (C) to conserve the stock and promote sustainability.

3. **Last Round Action (Round r)**: Always Defect (D)
   - In the final round, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff since there are no future rounds dependent on the current stock level.

### Rationale

- **First Round Cooperation**: Establishes a starting point to gauge how other players' actions affect the stock.
- **Adaptive Threshold**: Using a 75% threshold allows the strategy to exploit when resources are plentiful while conserving when they are scarce, promoting long-term sustainability.
- **Last Round Exploitation**: Maximizes payoff in the final round without concern for future depletion.

This approach ensures that we balance short-term gains with long-term resource management, adapting dynamically based on observed stock levels.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_102 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Start by Cooperating in the first round to gauge others' behavior without immediate depletion.
- **Adaptive Behavior Monitoring:** Track the number of players who Defected in previous rounds. If a significant portion (e.g., more than 50%) consistently Defect, switch to defecting more frequently.
- **Stock Thresholds:** Use thresholds based on remaining rounds and stock levels. If the stock is below a certain threshold or if few rounds remain, prioritize Defection for higher immediate payoffs.
- **Growth Consideration:** After observing high cooperation, consider Cooperating to allow stock replenishment for future exploitation.

**2. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to observe others' actions and set a baseline for future decisions.
- **Last Round (r):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future benefit from sustainability.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is critically low, switch to Cooperation temporarily to allow recovery if possible.

**3. Exploitative Mindset:**
- Continuously monitor opponents' strategies and adjust your actions to exploit their tendencies, whether cooperative or defective.
- Balance between short-term gains through Defection and long-term sustainability by occasionally Cooperating when beneficial.

This strategy dynamically adjusts based on observed behavior and game state, aiming to maximize individual payoffs while considering the necessity of resource replenishment for sustained exploitation.

To address the problem of deciding when to Cooperate or Defect in a repeated Tragedy of the Commons game, we can use an adaptive strategy that balances sustaining the resource for future rounds while maximizing immediate payoffs. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with Cooperate in the first round.
2. **Stock Monitoring**: Track the stock level at the end of each round.
3. **Low Stock Threshold**: If the stock falls below 25% of its initial capacity, switch to Cooperate to help replenish it.
4. **Adaptive Strategy**:
   - For rounds before the last one, if after Cooperating in the previous round the stock decreased significantly (e.g., by more than 10%), switch to Defect.
   - If you Defected last round and the stock remains above the threshold, continue Defecting.
5. **Last Round Maximization**: In the final round, always choose Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

This approach ensures that while we aim to sustain the resource for as long as possible, we also adapt our strategy based on observed outcomes, preventing others from exploiting our cooperation unduly.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_104 = '''
The "Adaptive Exploitation Strategy" is designed to balance cooperation and defection in the Common Pool Resource Game, ensuring maximum payoff while maintaining resource sustainability. Here's how the strategy works:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to encourage trust and maximize initial stock growth.

2. **Monitor Cooperation Rate**: Track the percentage of players who cooperated in recent rounds using a moving average (e.g., last 3 rounds). This helps assess others' behavior trends.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - If the cooperation rate is above or equal to 50%, continue cooperating.
   - If it drops below 50%, switch to defecting until cooperation improves, ensuring not to overexploit beyond half the current stock.

4. **Sustainability Check**: Always ensure that total consumption does not exceed half of the current stock, preventing over-depletion and aiding resource recovery.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to set a positive tone.
   - **Last Round**: Defect if no future rounds remain, as there's no need to preserve the stock beyond the current round.

This strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors, adaptively responding to trends while protecting resource health. It punishes defectors and rewards cooperators, ensuring long-term payoff optimization in a competitive environment.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_105 = '''
**Strategy Description: Adaptive Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C). This sets a positive tone and preserves the stock for future rounds.
   - **Middle Rounds**:
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate of all opponents over previous rounds, weighted more recent rounds if necessary.
     - Check the current stock level against a threshold (e.g., capacity/2).
       - If the stock is below this threshold: Choose to Cooperate (C) to allow growth.
       - If the average cooperation rate exceeds 50% and the stock is above the threshold: Cooperate (C).
       - Otherwise, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without being exploited.
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds, prioritize immediate gain.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The strategy explicitly addresses the first and last rounds with specific actions, ensuring clarity in decision-making during these critical points.
   - When the stock is critically low, cooperation is prioritized to prevent depletion, ensuring sustainability for maximum long-term payoffs.

3. **Exploitative Approach**:
   - The strategy leverages opponents' behavior by cooperating when others do so and defecting when exploitation is detected or necessary.
   - It balances between maintaining resource health for future rounds and exploiting opportunities for higher immediate gains when beneficial.

This adaptive approach ensures the player maximizes their payoffs while being robust against various opponent strategies, promoting sustainability without being a sucker.

To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a balanced approach that combines cooperation with strategic exploitation based on game state and opponent behavior.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Conservation (AEC)

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff by exploiting opponents' strategies while conserving stock for future rounds when necessary.

**Key Components:**

1. **Initial Cooperation (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to set a baseline and encourage potential cooperation from others.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels:**
   - Track the stock after each round. If it falls below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to conservation mode to prevent depletion.

3. **Opponent Behavior Analysis:**
   - Estimate opponents' strategies by observing past actions. Calculate the average cooperation rate.
   - If a significant number are defecting, adapt by increasing defection to avoid being exploited.

4. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - Use a dynamic threshold based on remaining rounds. In later rounds, be more cautious if stock is low to ensure future payoffs.

5. **Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    # Initialize variables
    stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    defection_rate = 0

    for round in range(r):
        current_stock = history['stock'][round]
        
        if round == 0:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            prev_stock = history['stock'][round-1]
            stock_change = current_stock - prev_stock
            
            # Assess opponents' actions
            opponent_actions = [a for a in history['actions'][round-1] if a != self_action]
            cooperation_rate = sum(1 for a in opponent_actions if a == 'C') / len(opponent_actions)
            
            # Determine action based on thresholds and behavior
            if current_stock < stock_threshold or (stock_change < 0 and cooperation_rate < 0.5):
                action = 'D'
                defection_rate += 1
            else:
                action = 'C'
        
        # Update history with action and new state
        history['actions'][round].append(action)
        update_stock(current_stock, action, n)
    
    return history
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to set a positive tone.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Switches to defection if stock is critically low to prevent depletion.
- **Behavioral Adaptation:** Analyzes opponents' past actions to decide when to exploit.
- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjusts strategy based on the number of rounds remaining, ensuring conservation when necessary.

**Conclusion:**
This strategy balances exploitation with conservation by adapting based on game state and opponent behavior. It aims to maximize total payoff while maintaining stock sustainability for future rounds.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Strategy (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a high initial stock level, encouraging potential future cooperation and maximizing collective payoff from the beginning.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Strategy:**
   - **Monitor Previous Actions:** Track the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - **Defection Threshold:** If more than 50% of players defected last round, choose to Defect (D) this round. This response discourages excessive exploitation and protects individual payoff.
   - **Cooperation Continuation:** If 50% or fewer defected, continue Cooperating (C), maintaining the stock for sustained future gains.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - **Low Stock Threshold:** If current stock drops below 20% of capacity, switch to Defecting (D) to secure higher immediate payoffs.
   - **High Stock Maintenance:** If stock is above 80% of capacity, Cooperate (C) to sustain the resource for future rounds.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - **Last Few Rounds:** In the final three rounds, increase tendency to Defect (D), prioritizing immediate gains over long-term sustainability as the game concludes.
   - **Final Round Action:** Always Defect (D) in the last round to maximize personal payoff without future repercussions.

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - **All Players Cooperate:** Continue cooperation to maintain high stock levels and mutual benefits.
   - **Mass Defection Detected:** If all or most players defect, switch to defecting to avoid being exploited, ensuring a better individual outcome even if the collective payoff drops.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

    defectors_last_round = count of D in previous_actions
    defect_threshold = len(previous_actions) * 0.5

To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create a rule-based approach that adapts to the game's state and opponents' actions. The strategy balances cooperation with timely defection to exploit opportunities while preserving resources for future rounds.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Threshold (AES)

1. **First Round Action**: Always Cooperate.
   - **Rationale**: Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and maintains a high stock level, which is beneficial for future exploitation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Except Last)**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**:
     - If the current stock level falls below 20% of the game's capacity, Defect.
       - **Rationale**: When the stock is critically low, cooperation yields minimal returns, so defecting maximizes immediate payoff before depletion.
   - **Defection Threshold**:
     - Calculate the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than half of the players defected, choose to Defect this round.
       - **Rationale**: Joining the majority prevents being exploited and aligns with the exploitative mindset.
     - If half or fewer defected, Cooperate.
       - **Rationale**: Maintain cooperation when others are cooperating to sustain stock levels for future exploitation.

3. **Last Round Action**: Always Defect.
   - **Rationale**: In the final round, there's no future stock to preserve, so defecting ensures maximum immediate payoff.

### Summary

- **Round 1**: Cooperate
- **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
  - If Stock < 20% of Capacity → Defect
  - Else, if Previous Round's Defectors > 50% → Defect
  - Else → Cooperate
- **Round r (Last)**: Defect

This strategy effectively balances cooperation and exploitation, ensuring high payoffs while considering the game's state and opponents' behaviors.

    - **Rationale:** To avoid being exploited and maximize immediate payoffs when cooperation isn't reciprocated or stock is depleting.

  - **Else:**
    - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
    - **Rationale:** Maintain a sustainable stock for future rounds while benefiting from others' cooperation.

- **Last Round:**
  - **Action:** Always Defect (D)
  - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact on the stock.

---

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to set a cooperative tone.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If stock drops below 50% capacity, prioritize defecting to secure higher payoffs while possible.
- **Last Round:** Defect to ensure maximum extraction without concern for future depletion.

---

#### 3. Exploitative Mindset:

The strategy adapts based on opponents' recent actions and the stock's health. By initially cooperating, it encourages others to do the same, but quickly shifts to defecting if exploitation is detected or if the stock is at risk. This approach ensures that the player maximizes their payoffs while being robust against various opponent strategies.

---

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == r:
        return "D"
    
    prev_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
    stock = history[-1]['stock_after_growth']
    
    if (num_defectors > n/2) or (stock < 0.5 * capacity):
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"
```

---

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring long-term payoffs while adapting to opponents' behaviors and the stock's condition.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_111 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection, considering both historical actions and current stock levels. The strategy is designed to be exploitative, ensuring sustainability while maximizing payoffs.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation Strategy (AES)

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation tests others' behavior without immediately exploiting.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   a. **Defection Threshold**: Calculate the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than half defected, choose to Defect (D) in the current round.
   b. **Stock Level Check**: Monitor the stock level relative to capacity. If the stock is below 30% of capacity, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains and prevent further depletion.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Always Defect (D). In the final round, prioritize immediate payoff since future sustainability is no longer a concern.

### Decision Rules

- **First Round**: Cooperate.
- **Middle Rounds**:
  - If previous round's defection count > n/2 OR stock < 0.3 * capacity → Defect.
  - Else → Cooperate.
- **Last Round**: Defect.

This strategy encourages cooperation when beneficial but adapts to exploit when others defect or when the resource is critically low, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors while maintaining long-term sustainability where possible.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_112 = '''
**Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same and establish a baseline of trust.

2. **Reciprocation Based on History**: 
   - Monitor the actions of other players over the past few rounds.
   - If a majority cooperated, continue cooperating.
   - If a significant number defected, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds to protect your payoffs.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring**:
   - Track the current stock level. If it falls below 50% of capacity, increase defection to secure immediate gains before further depletion.

4. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last 20% of rounds, gradually increase the rate of defection to maximize payoffs as the game concludes.

5. **Randomized Actions**: Introduce occasional randomness in your actions (e.g., 10% chance to defect even when cooperating) to avoid predictability and prevent exploitation by others.

This strategy aims to balance cooperative behavior with strategic defection, ensuring long-term resource sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs through adaptive responses to the game's dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_113 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a systematic approach that adapts to opponents' behaviors while ensuring long-term resource sustainability. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Action (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of behavior and observe others' responses without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Cooperation Rate:** Calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Assess Stock Health:** Evaluate the current stock level relative to capacity, with a threshold set at 50% of capacity.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - If the cooperation rate is high (e.g., ≥ 70%) and the stock is above the threshold:
     - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - **Rationale:** Maintain cooperative behavior to sustain resource levels.
   - If the cooperation rate is low or the stock drops below the threshold:
     - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - **Rationale:** Protect against exploitation and potential over-depletion by increasing immediate payoffs.

4. **Retaliation Mechanism:**
   - Track opponents' recent actions. If a significant number defected in the previous round, consider defecting to deter future exploitation.
   - Implement a "tit-for-tat" approach if feasible, though prioritize stock health and cooperation rate over direct retaliation.

5. **Final Round Consideration:**
   - In the last round, if the stock is critically low (e.g., <20% of capacity), consider defecting to maximize immediate payoff since future sustainability isn't a concern.
   - However, maintain cooperation if the stock is healthy to preserve long-term gains.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'
    
    prev_actions = [action for action in history[-1]['actions']]
    coop_rate = prev_actions.count('C') / n
    
    stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    below_threshold = current_stock < stock_threshold
    
    # Determine if recent actions warrant a shift towards defection
    if coop_rate >= 0.7 and not below_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage in a round
strategy = adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity, game_history)
```

### Strategy Rationale

- **Cooperation Initialization:** Starting with cooperation encourages initial resource preservation and allows observation of others' strategies.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** By adjusting based on the cooperation rate and stock health, the strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.
- **Retaliation and Deterrence:** Shifting to defection when necessary deters exploitation and adjusts to opponents' behaviors dynamically.

This approach ensures robustness against various opponent strategies while maximizing payoffs through adaptive exploitation.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_114 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to observe initial conditions without depleting the stock.
   
   - **Rounds 2 to r-3:** 
     - Calculate the average total consumption over the last three rounds.
     - If this average is closer to S_prev/2, indicating others are mostly cooperating, choose Defect (D).
     - If the average is higher, suggesting more defection, choose Cooperate (C) to help rebuild stock.
     - Additionally, if the current stock level drops below 50% of capacity, switch to Cooperate until stock recovers above this threshold.

   - **Last Three Rounds:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are limited.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **Stock Near Depletion:** If the stock is critically low (<25% of capacity), prioritize Cooperate to ensure regrowth and sustain future payoffs.
   - **High Stock Levels:** When stock is consistently high (>75% of capacity), defect more frequently, as regrowth can sustain higher consumption without depletion.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
   The strategy exploits others' cooperation by defecting when it's safe (high stock levels) and maintains stock health through cooperation when necessary. It adapts based on observed behavior and stock trends, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies while maximizing long-term payoffs.

This approach balances immediate gains with sustainable resource management, adapting dynamically to the game's state and history.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_115 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial stock sustainability.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If it's the last round, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock.
  - Calculate the number of defections by other players in previous rounds. If more than half have defected recently, initiate a Punishment Phase.
  - During Punishment Phase, defect for a set number of rounds (e.g., 3) to discourage others from exploiting cooperation.
- **Stock Level Consideration:** If stock falls below 50% of capacity, prioritize cooperation unless in Punishment Phase or others are frequently defecting.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and maintain high initial stock.
- **Last Round:** Defect to secure maximum final payoff without future repercussions.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to cooperation if stock is critically low, unless being exploited by others' defections.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
- The strategy is designed to exploit opponents by punishing defectors and encouraging a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.
- By monitoring others' actions and adjusting accordingly, the strategy aims to maximize personal payoff while maintaining a healthy stock level when beneficial.

This approach ensures adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors, balancing cooperation with strategic defection to optimize overall payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_116 = '''
To address the problem of determining when to cooperate or defect in a dynamic environment where the goal is to maximize payoffs while considering future consequences, we developed a strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on the current state (stock level) and the progression of the game. This approach ensures sustainability in early rounds while allowing for strategic exploitation as the game concludes.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to preserve the stock level.
2. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**:
   - For each subsequent round, calculate a threshold based on the remaining rounds. The threshold decreases as the game progresses, making it easier to defect in later rounds.
3. **Decision Making**:
   - If the current stock level is above the calculated threshold for that round, defect to maximize immediate gain.
   - If the stock level is below the threshold, cooperate to conserve resources for future rounds.
4. **Final Round Defection**: Always defect in the last round to ensure maximum payoff without concern for future consequences.

### Strategy Details

- **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a high initial stock level.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Compute the threshold as `threshold_t = capacity * (1 - t/r)`, where `t` is the current round and `r` is the total number of rounds. This threshold starts near the maximum capacity in early rounds and decreases as the game progresses.
  - Compare the current stock level to this threshold:
    - **Defect** if the stock level exceeds the threshold, exploiting higher stock levels when sustainable.
    - **Cooperate** if the stock level is below the threshold, conserving resources for future use.
- **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate gain without worrying about depleting the stock further.

### Example Walkthrough

Suppose we have a game with `n=4` players, `capacity=100`, and `r=10` rounds.

1. **Round 1**: Cooperate. Stock starts at 100.
2. **Round 2**:
   - Threshold = 100 * (1 - 2/10) = 80.
   - If stock after Round 1 is above 80, defect; otherwise, cooperate.
3. **Round 5**:
   - Threshold = 100 * (1 - 5/10) = 50.
   - Defect if stock is above 50; else, cooperate.
4. **Round 10**: Always defect to maximize payoff.

### Conclusion

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adjusting behavior based on the game's progression and current resource levels. It ensures that you act strategically, conserving when necessary and exploiting when beneficial, ultimately aiming to maximize your overall payoffs throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_117 = '''
To determine whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round of the game, we can follow a structured approach that balances preserving the resource for future rounds with maximizing immediate gains. Here's how you would decide:

1. **First Round**: Always choose to **Cooperate**. This helps maintain a high stock level early on.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**: 
   - If the current stock level is greater than **50% of the capacity**, continue to **Cooperate**. This preserves the resource for future rounds.
   - If the current stock level drops to **50% or below**, switch to **Defecting** to secure payoffs before others deplete the resource further.
3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Always choose to **Defect**, as there are no future rounds to preserve the resource for.

This strategy ensures that you maintain cooperation when the resource is plentiful but adapt by defecting once the stock significantly decreases or in the final round to maximize your payoff.

**Decision Making Summary**:
- First Round: Cooperate
- Rounds 2 to r-1: Cooperate if Stock > 50% of Capacity; otherwise, Defect
- Last Round: Always Defect

This approach balances between cooperation and exploitation, ensuring strategic play throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_118 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we aim to balance cooperation with strategic defection, leveraging the game's state and history to maximize payoffs. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: "Adaptive Cooperation with Endgame Exploitation"

1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning:** Encourage initial stock sustainability by starting with cooperation, setting the stage for potential mutual benefit.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Decision Rule:** 
     - After each round, observe if the stock after growth is below capacity.
     - If the stock drops below capacity in any previous round, switch to defecting in the current round.
     - If the stock remains at capacity, continue cooperating.
   - **Reasoning:** This rule punishes defectors by reducing cooperation when the stock is depleted, aiming to deter future defections while maintaining payoffs.

3. **Final Rounds (Rounds r-1 and r):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect.
   - **Reasoning:** Maximize immediate payoff in the endgame, as there's no future punishment possible after the game concludes.

### Pseudocode:

```
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        previous_stock_after_growth = history[-1]['stock_after']
        if previous_stock_after_growth < capacity and current_round <= r - 2:
            return "D"
        elif previous_stock_after_growth >= capacity and current_round <= r - 2:
            return "C"
        else:  # Last two rounds
            return "D"
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, we maximize collective payoff early on, encouraging others to follow suit.
- **Adaptive Defection:** Monitoring the stock level allows us to detect defections. If the stock drops below capacity, indicating exploitation by others, we switch to defecting to avoid being exploited further.
- **Endgame Exploitation:** In the final rounds, defecting ensures individual payoff maximization when future punishments are no longer possible.

This strategy effectively balances cooperation and strategic defection, optimizing for both sustainability and endgame gains.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_119 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

The proposed strategy is an adaptive approach designed to maximize individual payoffs while considering the dynamic state of the common pool stock and the behaviors of other players. It balances exploration, cooperation, punishment, and conservation based on observed actions and stock levels.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Exploration (First Round)**:
   - **Action**: Defect (D)
     - **Rationale**: To observe the impact on the stock and gauge others' initial strategies without compromising potential future gains.

2. **Main Strategy (Subsequent Rounds, excluding Last Round)**:
   - **Cooperation Threshold**: 50% cooperation rate in previous rounds.
   - **Low Stock Threshold**: 20% of capacity.
     - **Action**:
       - If the average cooperation rate from all previous rounds exceeds 50%, cooperate (C) unless the stock is below the low threshold, in which case also cooperate to allow recovery.
       - If the cooperation rate is 50% or lower, defect (D).

3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect (D).
     - **Rationale**: Maximize immediate payoff as future stock levels no longer matter.
   - **Low Stock Levels**: When the stock drops below 20% of capacity, switch to cooperation (C) until recovery begins.

4. **Punishment Mechanism**:
   - Implicit in the main strategy by defecting when others' cooperation is insufficient, discouraging over-exploitation.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def common_pool_strategy(n, r, capacity):
    current_stock = capacity  # Initial stock level
    cooperation_history = []  # Tracks number of cooperators each round

    for t in range(1, r + 1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'D'
        elif t == r:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            avg_coop_rate = sum(cooperation_history) / (len(cooperation_history) * n)
            if current_stock < 0.2 * capacity:
                action = 'C'
            elif avg_coop_rate > 0.5:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'

        # Update cooperation history
        if t != 1:  # First round handled separately
            cooperation_history.append(1 if action == 'C' else 0)
        
        yield action

    return
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Defection**: The first move is a defection to test the system and others' reactions.
- **Adaptive Cooperation**: Subsequent rounds use historical data on cooperation rates to decide actions, promoting sustainability when others cooperate sufficiently.
- **Stock Conservation**: When the stock is critically low, cooperation is prioritized to facilitate recovery.
- **Final Round Maximization**: The last round always defects to ensure maximum immediate gain without regard for future rounds.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to collective behavior and stock conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_120 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Decision:**
   - Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone, encouraging others to reciprocate and sustain the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Observe the stock level after the previous round's growth.
   - If the stock was below 75% of capacity in the previous round, choose to Defect (D) in the current round.
   - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).

3. **Last Round Decision:**
   - Always Defect (D). Since there are no future consequences, maximize immediate payoff.

This strategy adapts based on the stock's sustainability, switching to defecting when the resource is depleted beyond a threshold, thus balancing cooperation with self-interest.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_121 = '''
To address the dilemma of whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game with perfect information, we can employ a strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize payoffs while avoiding exploitation. Here's the step-by-step reasoning and final strategy:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round. This sets a cooperative tone and allows for the possibility of mutual cooperation, which can sustain the resource and maximize long-term payoffs.

2. **Monitor Past Actions**: After each round, observe how many players chose to defect. Since there's perfect information, you can count the exact number of defectors in any given round.

3. **Responsive Strategy**:
   - For each subsequent round (excluding the last), check if the number of defectors in the previous round exceeded the number of cooperators.
   - If more players defected than cooperated in the previous round, switch to defecting in the current round.
   - Otherwise, continue cooperating.

4. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, always choose to defect. This ensures that you maximize your immediate payoff without concern for future repercussions, as there are no subsequent rounds where your cooperation could be punished or reciprocated.

### Strategy Summary:

1. **Round 1**: Cooperate.
2. **Rounds 2 to T-1**:
   - If the number of defectors in the previous round was greater than the number of cooperators, defect this round.
   - Otherwise, cooperate.
3. **Round T (Last Round)**: Always defect.

### Conclusion:

This strategy effectively balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring you are not exploited while maximizing your final payoff. By responding to the majority behavior and securing a last-round advantage, you navigate the game optimally given perfect information and simultaneous moves.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_122 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll outline a clear and adaptive approach based on the game's parameters, state, and history.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and Time

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe the resulting stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Track the stock level after each round.
   - Calculate the average stock remaining over the past rounds to gauge collective behavior.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **If Stock is Above 50% of Capacity:** Cooperate to maintain a sustainable resource for future payoffs.
   - **If Stock Drops Below 50% of Capacity:** Switch to Defect (D) to maximize immediate gains and prevent being exploited by others' potential defection.

4. **Final Rounds Consideration:**
   - In the last few rounds, switch to Defection to secure higher immediate payoffs as future stock replenishment becomes less relevant.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(game_parameters):
    n = game_parameters['n']
    r = game_parameters['r']
    capacity = game_parameters['capacity']
    
    # Initialize cooperation threshold at 50% of capacity
    cooperation_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    # Track stock history to compute averages
    stock_history = []
    
    for round in range(1, r+1):
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            # Calculate average stock remaining from previous rounds
            avg_stock = sum(stock_history) / len(stock_history)
            
            # Determine number of remaining rounds
            remaining_rounds = r - round
            
            # If average stock is above threshold and enough rounds left, cooperate
            if avg_stock >= cooperation_threshold and remaining_rounds > (0.2 * r):
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'
        
        # Record current stock after consumption and growth
        # (Assuming access to the game state to update stock_history)
        stock_after = get_current_stock()
        stock_history.append(stock_after)
    
    return action
```

### Explanation of Strategy

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins with cooperation to encourage a cooperative environment, which is crucial for maintaining a high stock level.
- **Stock Monitoring:** By tracking the average stock remaining after each round, the strategy assesses whether others are cooperating or defecting. If the stock remains above 50% of capacity, it continues to cooperate.
- **Adaptive Threshold:** The threshold triggers a switch to defection if the stock depletes beyond a sustainable level, preventing further exploitation by others who may be defecting.
- **Endgame Strategy:** In later rounds, as the game nears conclusion, the strategy shifts towards maximizing immediate gains through defection, acknowledging that future payoffs become less significant.

This approach ensures the strategy is both exploitative and adaptive, balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability based on observed behavior and remaining game duration.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_123 = '''
To design an effective exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can create a reactive approach that balances cooperation with the ability to defect when necessary. This strategy will adapt based on observed stock levels, ensuring we maximize our payoffs by taking advantage of others' behaviors.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock-Level Threshold

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - Begin by cooperating to encourage a high initial stock level and set a cooperative tone.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - After each round, observe the current stock level.
   - Set a threshold at 75% of the capacity.
   - If the stock after the previous round is below this threshold, defect in the next round.
   - If the stock remains above or equal to the threshold, continue cooperating.

3. **Last Round Action**: Defect (D)
   - In the final round, always choose to defect since there are no future consequences for your actions.

### Decision Rules

- **Cooperate** if the previous round's stock level is at least 75% of capacity.
- **Defect** if the previous round's stock level drops below 75% of capacity or in the last round.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_cooperation(n, r, capacity):
    # Initialize variables
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    current_stock = capacity  # Initial stock level
    
    for t in range(1, r + 1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'C'
        elif t == r:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            if current_stock < threshold:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'
        
        # Simulate the game to get new stock level (this part would be handled by the game environment)
        # For demonstration, assume after choosing action, we observe new_stock
        # In real implementation, you'd receive new_stock from the environment
        # Here, we just update current_stock for next iteration
        if t != r:  # To avoid unnecessary update
            # Example calculation (actual depends on all players' actions)
            # For simulation purposes:
            current_stock = min(
                max(0, current_stock - sum_of_consumptions) + 
                2 * (current_stock - sum_of_consumptions) * (
                    1 - (current_stock - sum_of_consumptions)/capacity
                ),
                capacity
            )
    
    return action
```

### Explanation

- **First Round**: We start by cooperating to maintain a high stock level, which is beneficial for all players.
- **Middle Rounds**: After each round, we check if the stock has dropped below 75% of its capacity. If it has, we switch to defecting in the next round to prevent being exploited by others who may be over-consuming.
- **Last Round**: Since there are no future rounds where our actions could be punished, we always defect in the last round to maximize our immediate payoff.

This strategy is designed to be flexible and responsive, ensuring that while we prefer cooperation for mutual benefit, we won't hesitate to defect when necessary to protect our interests.

To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll employ a adaptive approach that balances immediate gain with long-term sustainability. The strategy, termed "Adaptive Exploitation," integrates elements of cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and stock levels.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to maximize the initial stock for future rounds.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - Calculate the average number of defections per player in previous rounds, weighted more heavily towards recent actions.
  - If the stock level is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate to facilitate regrowth.
  - If the stock level is above 50%, check the average defection rate:
    - If the average exceeds a threshold (e.g., 25%), Defect to exploit others' cooperation or punish excessive defection.
    - Otherwise, Cooperate to maintain a sustainable resource.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **Last Round:** Defect if the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) to maximize final payoff without compromising future rounds, which don't exist here.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to Cooperation if the stock drops below a critical point (e.g., 30%) to prevent depletion and allow regrowth.

**3. Exploitative Mindset:**

The strategy aims to exploit others' cooperative behavior by defecting when beneficial, while maintaining cooperation when it supports long-term resource sustainability. It adapts based on both historical actions and current stock conditions to maximize personal gain without undermining the resource's viability.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, history):
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 'C'  # First round

    stock = history[-1]['stock_after']
    previous_actions = [a for a in history[-1]['actions'].values()]

    avg_defections = sum(1 for a in previous_actions if a == 'D') / n
    weighted_avg_defections = calculate_weighted_average(history)

    if stock < 0.5 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if avg_defections > 0.25 or weighted_avg_defections > 0.3:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def calculate_weighted_average(history):
    weights = [0.5**i for i in range(len(history))]
    total = sum( (sum(1 for a in h['actions'].values() if a == 'D') / n) * weights[i] for i, h in enumerate(history))
    return total / sum(weights)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to set a positive tone and maintain high stock levels.
- **Stock Thresholds:** Uses 50% of capacity as a trigger; below this, cooperation is prioritized for regrowth.
- **Defection Thresholds:** If defection rates exceed predefined levels (25%), the strategy switches to defecting to exploit others or signal dissatisfaction with their behavior.
- **Weighted Average:** Considers recent actions more heavily to adapt quickly to changing behaviors.

This approach ensures that the player balances exploitation with sustainability, aiming for maximum personal gain while preserving the resource for future rounds.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_125 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing individual payoff by adapting to others' behavior while strategically deciding when to cooperate or defect.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Historical Behavior

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Few Rounds):**
   - Begin with cooperation in the first few rounds (e.g., first 2-3 rounds) to observe others' actions and establish a baseline of cooperation.
   
2. **Monitor Cooperation Rate:**
   - After the initial phase, calculate the average cooperation rate of other players based on their past actions. This is done by tracking how many times each player chose C versus D in previous rounds.

3. **Dynamic Threshold for Defection:**
   - Set a threshold (e.g., 50%) for the average cooperation rate. If the majority of players are defecting (average below the threshold), switch to defecting in subsequent rounds.
   
4. **Stock-Level Consideration:**
   - Continuously monitor the current stock level. If it's critically low, defect to secure immediate gains since conservation may no longer be beneficial.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final few rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds), shift towards defecting more frequently to maximize short-term payoffs, as future sustainability becomes less relevant.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(game_state, history):
    # Parameters
    n = game_state['n']
    r = game_state['r']
    capacity = game_state['capacity']
    current_stock = game_state['stock']
    round_number = game_state['round']

    if round_number <= initial_coop_rounds:
        return 'C'
    
    cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(history)
    defect_threshold = 0.5
    
    if cooperation_rate < defect_threshold or current_stock < critical_stock_level:
        return 'D'
    
    # Consider endgame
    if round_number >= r - endgame_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    return 'C'

# Helper functions
def calculate_cooperation_rate(history):
    total_actions = len(history)
    cooperation_count = sum(1 for action in history if action == 'C')
    return cooperation_count / total_actions

def get_critical_stock_level(capacity, n):
    return 0.3 * capacity  # Example threshold; may need tuning
```

### Strategy Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to encourage resource sustainability and gather initial data on others' behavior.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Uses past actions to determine if defecting becomes more beneficial, ensuring the strategy doesn't let others exploit it.
- **Stock Consideration:** Adjusts based on stock levels to prevent over-exploitation that could hinder future payoffs unnecessarily.
- **Endgame Focus:** Prioritizes immediate gains when the game nears its end, as future rounds no longer matter.

This approach is robust against various behaviors and dynamically adjusts to maximize individual payoff while considering both current and future states of the resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_126 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Decision:**
   - Cooperate (C) to observe the behavior of other players and establish a baseline of cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Until Last Round):**
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate from the previous round.
     - If more than half of the players cooperated, defect (D) to exploit their cooperative actions.
     - Additionally, consider the current stock level. Only defect if the stock is sufficiently high to sustain increased consumption without significant depletion.
   - If fewer than half cooperated, cooperate (C) to contribute to stock replenishment and encourage a sustainable resource.

3. **Last Round Decision:**
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

This strategy balances exploiting others' cooperation with maintaining the health of the common pool resource, ensuring long-term payoffs by preserving the stock when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_127 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Action (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to avoid initial depletion and encourage a healthy stock level for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Before Last Round):**
   - **Observation:** Analyze the number of players who cooperated in the previous round and the current stock level.
   - **Thresholds:**
     - If more than 50% of players cooperated last round AND current stock is above 75% of capacity:
       - **Action:** Defect (D) to exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate payoff while ensuring stock remains robust.
     - Otherwise:
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C) to conserve the resource and allow stock recovery or growth.
   - **Adjustment:** If defecting leads to a significant drop in stock, consider switching back to cooperation temporarily to prevent severe depletion.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences for resource depletion.

4. **Robustness Considerations:**
   - The strategy adapts based on the opponents' past behavior and current stock state, making it resilient against various play styles.
   - Incorporates a forgiveness mechanism by potentially cooperating after significant stock drops to balance exploitation with conservation.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by balancing cooperation and defection based on historical actions and the game's state, ensuring both immediate gains and long-term resource sustainability.

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Begin by Cooperating (C) in the first round to encourage initial cooperation and observe others' responses.
- **Mirror Opponents:** After the first round, mirror the majority action of other players from the previous round. If most Cooperated, you Cooperate; if most Defected, you Defect.
- **Stock Level Adjustment:** Continuously monitor the stock level. If it falls below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to Cooperation to allow recovery. Adjust this threshold based on remaining rounds and observed opponent behavior.
- **Sustainability Check:** Calculate the average payoff per player per round. If Defecting consistently yields higher payoffs without depleting the stock, continue Defecting; otherwise, Cooperate.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and gather initial data on others' strategies.
- **Last Round:** In the final round, if the stock is sufficient (e.g., above 50% of capacity), Defect to maximize immediate payoff. If stock is low, Cooperate to ensure some recovery for future rounds, though in the last round, this may not be necessary.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
- **Adaptive Play:** Use past actions and stock levels to adapt your strategy dynamically. This means sometimes exploiting others' cooperation by Defecting when beneficial but also preserving the resource for future exploitation.
- **Robustness:** The strategy doesn't rely on specific coordination mechanisms, making it robust against various opponent behaviors. It adapts based on observed actions and current game state.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
def decide_action(round, stock, history):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        previous_actions = history[round-2]
        count_c = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == "C")
        count_d = len(previous_actions) - count_c
        
        # Determine majority action
        if count_c > count_d:
            proposed_action = "C"
        else:
            proposed_action = "D"
            
        # Check stock level
        if stock < 0.25 * capacity:
            return "C"
        else:
            return proposed_action

def adjust_strategy(round, stock, history):
    # Analyze past actions and stock trends
    # Adjust threshold or strategy as needed
    pass

action = decide_action(current_round, current_stock, action_history)
```

This strategy balances cooperation to maintain resource sustainability with strategic defection to exploit opportunities for higher payoffs, adapting dynamically based on game state and opponents' behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_129 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to cooperate or defect in a repeated game with a common resource (like a fishery), we can use an adaptive strategy that responds to the health of the resource, indicated by its stock level. The goal is to balance maintaining the resource for future rounds while exploiting it when others are over-harvesting.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate to start with a high stock level and encourage cooperation.
2. **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):** 
   - Defect if the previous round's stock level fell below 50% of capacity, indicating others are likely defecting.
   - Cooperate if the stock is above 75%, showing healthy levels and likely cooperation from others.
   - If the stock is between 50% and 75%, check if it decreased in the last round; defect if it did, otherwise continue cooperating.
3. **Last Round (r):** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

### Pseudocode:
```python
def decide_action(current_round, r, previous_stock, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        threshold_defect = 0.5 * capacity
        threshold_cooperate = 0.75 * capacity
        
        if previous_stock < threshold_defect:
            return 'D'
        elif previous_stock > threshold_cooperate:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Check trend: defect if stock decreased in the last round
            if current_round >=3 and get_previous_stock(current_round-2) > previous_stock:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'

# Helper function to get stock from two rounds ago (simplified for explanation)
def get_previous_stock(round_num):
    # Implement logic to retrieve the stock level after round_num
    pass
```

### Explanation:
- **First Round:** Cooperation sets a positive tone and maintains high stock levels.
- **Intermediate Rounds:** The strategy adapts based on observed stock trends. Defecting when stock is low prevents being exploited, while cooperating when stock is healthy sustains the resource.
- **Last Round:** Maximizes immediate gain since future rounds don't matter.

This approach balances cooperation with strategic defection to optimize payoffs across all rounds.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Start by cooperating to establish a high initial stock level, encouraging others to reciprocate and maintain a sustainable resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:**
     - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity:
         - **Cooperation Check:** Analyze the actions of other players in the previous round.
           - If fewer than half defected, continue Cooperating (C).
           - If half or more defected, switch to Defecting (D) to protect your share.
     - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity:
         - **Defect (D):** Switch strategies to maximize immediate gain as the stock is depleted and future rounds may offer less.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: In the last round, with no future consequences, defecting maximizes your payoff since there's no subsequent impact on the stock.

**Strategy Overview:**
- Begins cooperatively to encourage a sustainable resource.
- Monitors others' actions and adjusts based on their behavior and stock levels.
- Switches to defection when necessary to protect against exploitation or when the stock is low, ensuring maximum immediate gain.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, exploiting others' cooperative tendencies while safeguarding against over-exploitation.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_131 = '''
To address the challenge of maintaining a sustainable common resource while maximizing personal gain, we'll employ an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation and defection. This approach considers both the current state of the resource and the behavior of other players.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round: Cooperate**
   - Start by cooperating to avoid immediate depletion of the resource and encourage a sustainable beginning.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1: Adaptive Decision**
   - **If Current Stock is Below Half Capacity:** Cooperate to help the stock recover.
   - **Else, Consider Previous Behavior:** If at least half of the players defected in the previous round, defect this round; otherwise, cooperate.

3. **Last Round (r): Defect**
   - Maximize personal gain in the final round since there's no future impact on the resource.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Round 1: Cooperate**
   - All players start by cooperating to ensure the resource remains healthy and sustainable from the beginning.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   - **Check Stock Level:** If the current stock is below half of its maximum capacity, choose to cooperate to support recovery.
   - **Assess Previous Behavior:** Count how many players defected in the previous round. If at least half defected, defect this round to protect your share; otherwise, continue cooperating.

3. **Round r: Defect**
   - In the final round, there’s no incentive to maintain the resource for future rounds, so defecting maximizes immediate gain.

### Example:

- **Players:** 4
- **Capacity:** 100 units

1. **Round 1: All Cooperate**
   - Stock remains at 100.
   
2. **Round 2:**
   - Stock is above 50; check previous defections (0).
   - Since fewer than half defected, all cooperate again.

3. **Round 3:**
   - If in Round 2, two or more defected:
     - You defect to protect your share.
   - Otherwise, continue cooperating.

4. **Final Round: Defect**
   - Regardless of previous actions, defect to maximize personal gain.

This strategy balances the need for resource sustainability with strategic defection when necessary, ensuring optimal outcomes in both cooperative and competitive scenarios.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to encourage others to cooperate and observe their initial behavior.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels:**
   - Track the stock level after each round.
   - Calculate the expected stock level if all players had cooperated. Compare this with the actual stock level to determine potential overexploitation by others.

3. **Threshold-Based Adaptation:**
   - If the stock level drops below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) or shows a consistent declining trend, switch strategy to Defect (D) in subsequent rounds.
   - Continue defecting until the stock begins to recover towards capacity.

4. **Tit-for-Tat Inspired Response:**
   - Estimate the number of defectors based on stock depletion rates. If defection is detected, respond by defecting in the next round.
   - Return to cooperation if others start cooperating again, indicated by stock recovery.

5. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - In the final round, defect (D) since there are no future consequences, maximizing immediate payoff.

6. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of current strategy based on recent stock trends and adapt accordingly.
   - Balance between cooperation to sustain resources and defection to exploit others' cooperation.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive, switching between cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and stock dynamics, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies while maximizing individual payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_133 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to create rules that adapt based on the game's parameters, state, and history while maximizing our payoff. The strategy should be robust against various opponent behaviors without relying on communication or cooperation.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and Defection

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This establishes a baseline of cooperation and allows us to observe others' initial actions.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     - **Monitor the Previous Round's Actions**: Count how many players defected in the previous round.
     - **Stock Threshold Check**: If the stock level after the previous round is below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), defect (D). This prevents further depletion and secures your payoff before the stock diminishes significantly.
     - **Defection Threshold**: If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round. This punishes defectors and deters excessive exploitation.
     - **Tit-for-Tat with a Forgiveness Mechanism**: Cooperate if fewer than half defected previously, allowing for some forgiveness to maintain cooperation when possible.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always cooperate to initiate cooperation and gather initial data on others' actions.
   - **Last Round (Round r)**: Defect (D) since there are no future consequences, maximizing immediate payoff.
   - **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock is critically low (e.g., below 25% of capacity), defect to secure whatever remains before it's depleted.

3. **Exploitative Approach**:
   - The strategy aligns with an exploitative mindset by taking advantage of others' cooperation while minimizing losses when others defect.
   - It balances punishment for defectors with maintaining a sustainable stock level for future rounds, ensuring long-term payoffs aren't jeopardized by short-term greed.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategyParameters(n, r, capacity):
    # Initialize cooperation in the first round
    if current_round == 1:
        action = "C"
    else:
        previous_stock = history["stock_after"][current_round - 2]
        previous_actions = history["actions"][current_round - 2]
        
        defectors_last_round = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == "D")
        
        # Determine thresholds
        stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        defect_proportion = 0.5
        
        if previous_stock < stock_threshold or (defectors_last_round / n) > defect_proportion:
            action = "D"
        else:
            action = "C"
    
    return action

# Edge cases handled within the strategy
if current_round == r:  # Last round
    action = "D"

if previous_stock < 0.25 * capacity:  # Critically low stock
    action = "D"

```

### Explanation

- **First Round Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to set a cooperative tone and observe others' initial moves.
- **Stock Monitoring**: Defects if the stock falls below a critical level, ensuring resources are secured before depletion.
- **Defection Punishment**: Defects in response to high levels of previous defection, discouraging excessive exploitation by others.
- **Forgiveness Mechanism**: Cooperates when fewer than half defect, allowing for potential future cooperation and sustainable resource use.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, responding to both the game's state and opponents' actions without requiring communication or coordination. It aims to exploit opportunities while maintaining a balance that ensures long-term payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_134 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round based on observed stock levels, we can implement a reactive strategy. This approach aims to maintain cooperation unless there's evidence that others are defecting, indicated by decreasing stock levels.

### Strategy:
1. **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If the stock level at the end of the previous round is lower than the stock level at the start of the previous round, choose to Defect in the current round.
   - Otherwise, continue to Cooperate.
3. **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation encourages others to do the same and maintains a high stock level.
- **Reactive Defection:** If the stock decreases after any round, it suggests that some players defected. Switching to defection in the next round helps avoid being exploited by those defecting.
- **Final Round Defection:** On the last round, there's no future consequence, so defecting maximizes your payoff regardless of others' actions.

This strategy balances cooperation and self-interest by reacting to observable changes in stock levels, ensuring you don't remain cooperative when others are not.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_135 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game with perfect information, we can implement an adaptive strategy that balances exploiting high resource levels while contributing to their maintenance when necessary. The strategy is designed as follows:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline and observe how the stock changes based on others' actions.
2. **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.
3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, defect to take advantage of the high resource level.
   - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, cooperate to help replenish the resource.
   - For intermediate levels (between 50% and 75%), decide based on the trend: defect if the stock is stable or increasing, otherwise cooperate.

### Strategy Pseudocode:
```python
def decide_action(t, current_stock, prev_stock, capacity):
    if t == r:
        return "Defect"
    
    if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
        return "Defect"
    elif current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        if current_stock >= prev_stock:
            return "Defect"
        else:
            return "Cooperate"

# Initialize
prev_stock = capacity
my_actions = ["Cooperate"]  # First round action

for t in range(2, r + 1):
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    action = decide_action(t, current_stock, prev_stock, capacity)
    my_actions.append(action)
    prev_stock = current_stock
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, we set a cooperative tone and allow the stock to remain high initially.
- **Last Round Defection**: In the final round, defecting ensures maximum personal gain since there are no future rounds to consider.
- **Thresholds**:
  - **75% Threshold**: When resources are plentiful (above 75%), it's safe to exploit them without significant risk of depletion.
  - **50% Threshold**: If resources fall below this level, cooperation is necessary to prevent further decline and ensure sustainability.
  - **Trend-Based Decision for Intermediate Levels**: By considering whether the stock is increasing or decreasing between 50% and 75%, we adaptively respond to the system's state, balancing exploitation with conservation.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while contributing to resource sustainability through adaptive decisions based on observed trends and predefined thresholds.

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**

     - Cooperation Ratio = (Number of Cooperators) / n
   - If the cooperation ratio is above a threshold (e.g., 0.5), continue cooperating to sustain stock levels.
   - If the cooperation ratio drops below this threshold, switch to defecting to exploit others' cooperative behavior or prevent personal loss.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., when remaining rounds ≤ 2-3), always defect to maximize immediate gains, as future stock sustainability becomes less relevant.

4. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - Continuously monitor the current stock level and its trend.
   - If the stock is significantly depleted, prioritize defecting to secure remaining resources before they dwindle further.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, adapting based on others' behavior and the game's progression to maximize total payoff while maintaining robustness against various opponent strategies.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_137 = '''
To address the challenge of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round of the game, we can develop an adaptive strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the common resource. The strategy is based on observing the stock level trends and adjusting actions accordingly.

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy involves two main components: cooperating when the stock is low to help replenish it and defecting when the stock is sufficiently high to maximize personal gain. This approach ensures that we do not overexploit the resource while still taking advantage of opportunities when it's sustainable.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate in the first round. This conservative start allows us to observe the initial impact on the stock without immediate depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - For each subsequent round, evaluate the current stock level (S_t).
   - Compare S_t against a predefined threshold, which is set at 75% of the capacity.
     - If S_t is below this threshold, choose to Cooperate to help replenish the stock.
     - If S_t is above or equal to the threshold, choose to Defect to maximize immediate gain.

3. **Final Round Action**:
   - In the last round, always defect to secure the maximum possible immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(t, S_t, capacity):
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    
    if t == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        if S_t < threshold:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"

# Example usage in a loop over rounds:
capacity = 1000  # example value
for t in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    if t == 1:
        action = "C"
    else:
        S_t = get_current_stock_level()
        threshold = 0.75 * capacity
        if S_t < threshold:
            action = "C"
        else:
            action = "D"
    take_action(action)
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Threshold Adjustment**: The threshold of 75% can be tuned based on empirical testing or specific game dynamics.
- **Stock Level Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the stock level after each round to inform future decisions effectively.

This strategy aims to optimize personal gain while contributing to the sustainability of the common resource, ensuring a balance between immediate benefits and long-term availability.

### Exploitative Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game

#### 1. Decision Rules:
The strategy is based on a threshold model that adapts to the game state and opponent behavior:

- **Threshold Calculation**: 
  - Let \( T_t \) be the dynamic threshold in round \( t \), calculated as:
    \[
    T_t = \max\left(\frac{\text{capacity}}{2}, \min\left(\text{capacity}, \frac{\text{current stock}}{n} + \alpha \cdot \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} \text{average opponent consumption}}{t-1}\right)\right)
    \]
    where \( 0 < \alpha < 1 \) is an adjustment factor (e.g., 0.3).

- **Action Decision**:
  - If the current stock \( S_t \geq T_t \), play **C**.
  - Otherwise, play **D**.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Play **C** to observe opponents' behavior and avoid immediate depletion.
- **Last Round (t = r)**: Play **D** to maximize immediate payoff since future stock is irrelevant.
- **Low Stock Levels**: If \( S_t < \text{capacity}/n \), play **D** to exploit remaining resources.

#### 3. Exploitative Mindset:
The strategy exploits opponents by defecting when the stock is below a dynamic threshold, encouraging sustainability while maximizing payoffs. It adapts based on observed behavior and stock trends.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
Initialize:
    total_defections = 0
    avg_opponent_consumption = 0

For each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        calculate T_t using the formula above
        if S_t >= T_t:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D
    
    observe opponents' actions and update total_defections
    update avg_opponent_consumption

Execute action and update payoff
```

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to opponents' behavior dynamically.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_139 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize payoffs, we'll implement an adaptive approach based on observed behavior and stock health. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Stock Sustainability

1. **First Round Decision**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale**: Start by cooperating to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' initial actions without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Decision Rule**:
     - Calculate the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     - Assess the stock level after the previous round.
     - If more than half of the players defected last round OR the stock level has dropped below a critical threshold (e.g., capacity/2), choose to Defect (D) this round.
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).
   - **Rationale**: This rule adapts based on others' actions and ensures that if cooperation isn't maintained or the stock is at risk, we switch to defecting to exploit current gains.

3. **Last Round Decision**:
   - **Action**: Always Defect (D).
   - **Rationale**: In the final round, with no future rounds to preserve the stock for, maximizing immediate payoff takes precedence.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_reciprocity_strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == r:
        return "D"
    else:
        previous_actions = history[-1]['actions']
        num_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
        stock_after_last = history[-1]['stock_after']

        # Determine threshold: e.g., half the players or stock below half capacity
        threshold_players = n / 2
        threshold_stock = capacity / 2

        if num_defectors > threshold_players or stock_after_last < threshold_stock:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
```

### Explanation

- **First Round**: Cooperate to initiate potential mutual cooperation and avoid immediate depletion.
- **Middle Rounds**: Adapt based on the majority's previous actions and stock health. If too many defected or the stock is low, defect to exploit; otherwise, continue cooperating.
- **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate gain without concern for future stock.

This strategy is robust, adapting to opponents' behaviors while ensuring sustainability when possible, thereby maximizing total payoffs over the game's duration.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_140 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll adopt a balanced approach that considers both immediate gains and long-term sustainability. The strategy, named "Adaptive Exploitation," aims to maximize payoffs by dynamically adjusting actions based on the stock level and opponents' past behavior.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation helps preserve the stock, allowing it to grow and providing a buffer against potential early defections by others.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Until Last Round)**:
   - **Stock Thresholds**:
     - **High Stock (S > 75% of Capacity)**: If more than half of the other players defected in the previous round, defect (D). Otherwise, cooperate (C).
     - **Moderate Stock (50% ≤ S ≤ 75% of Capacity)**: Defect if the majority of other players defected last round; otherwise, cooperate.
     - **Low Stock (S < 50% of Capacity)**: Always cooperate to allow stock recovery.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Regardless of previous actions or stock levels, defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a conservative tone, preserving the stock and encouraging growth.
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: By adjusting actions based on stock levels and opponents' behavior, the strategy balances exploitation with sustainability. High stock levels provide leeway for defection when others are defecting, while low stock levels prioritize recovery through cooperation.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Defecting in the last round ensures maximum short-term gain without compromising future rounds, as there are none.

### Implementation

The strategy can be implemented using conditional checks on the current stock level and historical data of other players' actions. Pseudocode for this approach might look like:

```
if first_round:
    action = C
else if last_round:
    action = D
else:
    previous_defections = count of D in last round
    if S > 0.75 * capacity:
        if previous_defections > n/2:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C
    elif 0.5 * capacity <= S <= 0.75 * capacity:
        if previous_defections > n/2:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C
    else:  # S < 0.5 * capacity
        action = C

execute action and observe outcomes
```

This approach is robust, adaptive, and exploitative, aiming to maximize payoffs while maintaining the stock's health for future rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_141 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we can employ an adaptive strategy that balances exploitation with sustainability based on the current state and historical actions. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Round Strategy**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This sets a conservative tone to prevent initial resource depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: Use 75% of capacity as a benchmark.
     - If stock > 75%: Defect (D) to exploit the abundant resource without causing significant depletion.
     - If stock ≤ 75%: Cooperate (C) to conserve and allow regeneration.
   - **Historical Actions Review**:
     - Calculate the proportion of players who defected in the previous round.
     - If ≥50% defected, switch to Cooperate (C) to encourage stock recovery.
     - If <50% defected, consider defecting if the stock is healthy, enhancing immediate payoffs.

3. **Final Round Consideration**:
   - In the last round, Defect (D) to maximize individual payoff since future consequences are irrelevant.

4. **Monitoring and Adaptation**:
   - Continuously monitor the stock level and opponents' actions.
   - Adjust the strategy dynamically based on these observations to maintain a balance between exploitation and conservation.

This approach ensures that we exploit when possible while preserving resource viability for future rounds, promoting sustainability and strategic advantage.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_142 = '''
To solve this problem, we need to design a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability in a game where players can choose to cooperate or defect. The goal is to maximize the player's payoff while considering the stock level and other players' past actions.

### Approach
The strategy involves observing the actions of all players in previous rounds and adjusting our behavior based on their cooperation rates and the current stock level. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate. This is a starting point to potentially build trust and maintain a high stock level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (until the last round)**:
   - Calculate the number of players who cooperated in the previous round (`C_prev`).
   - Check the current stock level before actions in the current round (`S_t_current`).
   - If at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round and the current stock level is above 75% of the capacity, continue cooperating.
   - Otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff without worrying about future depletion.
3. **Last Round**: Always defect. Since there are no future rounds to worry about, prioritize immediate gain.

This strategy ensures that we cooperate when sufficient players are contributing to a sustainable stock level and defect otherwise or in the final round to maximize our own payoff.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(n, r, current_round, prev_actions, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Determine if it's the last round
    is_last_round = (current_round == r)
    
    if is_last_round:
        return "Defect"
    
    # Count number of cooperators in previous round
    c_prev = sum(1 for action in prev_actions[current_round-2] if action == "Cooperate")
    
    # Get current stock level before actions in this round
    s_t_current = get_current_stock()
    
    # Check conditions to decide action
    if c_prev >= n / 2 and s_t_current > 0.75 * capacity:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"

# Helper function to get current stock level (implementation details omitted)
def get_current_stock():
    pass
```

### Explanation
- **First Round**: We start by cooperating to maintain a high initial stock level.
- **Subsequent Rounds**: For each round except the last, we check how many players cooperated in the previous round. If at least half of them cooperated and the current stock is above 75% capacity, we continue cooperating. Otherwise, we defect.
- **Last Round**: We always defect to maximize our immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

This approach ensures that we adaptively balance cooperation with strategic defection based on observed behavior and stock levels, aiming to maximize our own payoffs while considering the dynamics of the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_143 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts to the game state and history without relying on coordination, we can implement a threshold-based approach. The strategy balances cooperation to maintain stock levels with defection to exploit when the stock is low, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Level

1. **First Round (t=1):**
   - Cooperate (C) to initialize trust and maximize initial stock sustainability.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (2 ≤ t < r):**
   - **Cooperate (C)** if the current stock is above two-thirds (2/3) of the capacity.
     - This maintains a high stock level, encouraging sustainable payoffs in future rounds.
   - **Defect (D)** if the current stock is at or below two-thirds of the capacity.
     - Protects against being exploited and secures higher immediate payoffs when the stock is depleted.

3. **Last Round (t = r):**
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future rounds dependent on the current stock level.

### Rationale

- **First Round Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to build a high initial stock, which benefits all players in subsequent rounds.
  
- **Stock Threshold for Intermediate Rounds:** The two-thirds threshold acts as a clear indicator of when the stock is sufficiently healthy. Cooperating maintains it, while defecting prevents further depletion and allows for higher payoffs when others may also be exploiting.

- **Last Round Defection:** Since there's no future beyond the last round, maximizing immediate gain is optimal regardless of the stock level.

This strategy is robust, adaptive, and exploitative, adjusting actions based on observable game state without requiring coordination or communication with other players.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_144 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round while balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, we can develop an adaptive strategy based on observing past behavior and ensuring sustainable resource use. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy:
1. **First Round (Round 1):** Choose to Cooperate. This initial cooperation helps avoid depleting the stock too early and allows observation of others' actions.
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - For each round, after observing the previous round's total consumption, calculate whether it exceeded half of the resource capacity (capacity/2).
   - If the previous round's total consumption was above this sustainable threshold, choose to Cooperate in the current round to help sustain the stock.
   - If the previous round's total consumption was below or equal to the threshold, choose to Defect to maximize your immediate payoff.
3. **Last Round (Round r):** Always choose to Defect. Since there are no future rounds, maximizing your final payoff is optimal.

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, you contribute to preserving the stock early on and set a baseline for others' behavior.
- **Adaptive Response:** After the first round, each decision is based on whether the previous round's total consumption exceeded a sustainable level. This ensures that if overconsumption occurs, corrective action (Cooperating) is taken to prevent depletion.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** In the last round, with no future consequences for resource depletion, defecting maximizes your immediate benefit.

This strategy balances between preserving the resource for sustained use across all rounds and strategically defecting when it's advantageous or necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_145 = '''
To tackle the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we need an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize payoffs while maintaining the stock's sustainability. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Punishment (AEP)

1. **First Round**:
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' initial actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Monitor Past Behavior**: Calculate the total consumption from the previous round.
     - If the total consumption exceeds half of the capacity (`consumption > 0.5 * capacity`), defect in the current round as a punitive measure against exploitation.
   - **Stock Level Check**: If the current stock is below a quarter of the capacity (`stock < 0.25 * capacity`), defect to maximize immediate payoff, acknowledging that future payoffs may be compromised.
   - **Default Cooperation**: If neither condition is met, cooperate to sustain the stock and encourage mutual benefit.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**:
   - Always Defect (D) to secure the highest possible payoff in the final round, as there are no subsequent rounds where punishment or cooperation can be enforced.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of others' strategies without immediate conflict.
  
- **Punishment Mechanism**: By defecting when previous consumption is high, we deter excessive exploitation, encouraging others to return to cooperation. This maintains stock health and discourages chronic defection.

- **Stock-Level Adaptation**: Defecting when the stock is critically low ensures that we secure higher payoffs before potential depletion, recognizing that very low stock levels may not recover sufficiently for future rounds.

- **Endgame Strategy**: In the last round, defecting maximizes immediate gain since there's no future punishment or benefit from cooperation after the game concludes.

### Pseudocode

```python
def aep_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, history, is_last_round):
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return 'C'
    
    previous_consumption = sum_of_previous_actions(current_stock, history)
    threshold_consumption = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if previous_consumption > threshold_consumption:
        return 'D'  # Punish by defecting
    elif current_stock < 0.25 * capacity:
        return 'D'  # Defect to maximize immediate payoff
    else:
        if is_last_round:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

# Helper function to calculate previous round's total consumption
def sum_of_previous_actions(current_stock, history):
    # Calculate based on the previous stock and actions in history
    pass
```

### Conclusion

This strategy effectively balances cooperation with necessary defection, ensuring both individual payoff maximization and maintaining the resource for future exploitation. It adapts dynamically to others' behavior and the game's state, making it robust against various strategic approaches by other players.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_146 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to cooperate or defect in a repeated game with perfect information, we can design an adaptive strategy that balances maintaining the stock for future payoffs with exploiting it when advantageous. Here's a structured approach:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate. This helps establish a high initial stock level and encourages others to do the same.
   
2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - **Cooperate** if the current stock level is above 50% of the game's capacity. This maintains the stock at a healthy level, allowing for sustainable future payoffs.
   - **Defect** if the current stock level drops to 50% or below of the capacity. Defecting here maximizes your immediate payoff when the stock is being significantly depleted by others.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Always Defect. Since there are no future rounds, you should prioritize maximizing your immediate payoff without concern for depleting the stock further.

This strategy adapts to the current state of the stock and incentivizes cooperation while the stock is plentiful, switching to exploitation when it's advantageous or necessary. It balances long-term sustainability with short-term gains, ensuring a robust approach across various scenarios.

**Final Answer:**

The optimal strategy is to cooperate in the first round, continue cooperating as long as the stock remains above 50% of capacity, defect once it drops below this threshold, and always defect in the final round. This approach ensures you maximize your payoffs while considering both immediate gains and future sustainability.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate when the stock is above 50% of capacity; defect otherwise, including the last round.}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_147 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round to maximize payoffs, we'll use a threshold-based strategy that balances immediate gains with future sustainability. The approach considers the current stock level relative to capacity and adjusts behavior accordingly.

### Strategy:

1. **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
2. **Thresholds:**
   - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, defect to exploit higher payoffs while the stock is plentiful.
   - If the current stock is below or equal to 50%, cooperate to conserve resources and allow the stock to recover.

### Explanation:

- **Defecting when stock > 50%:** By defecting when the stock is high, you take advantage of higher immediate returns. The strategy assumes that the stock can sustain this level of consumption without dropping too low, allowing for continued exploitation in subsequent rounds.
  
- **Cooperating when stock ≤ 50%:** Cooperating helps conserve the stock, enabling it to recover due to the growth mechanism. This ensures that future rounds still have sufficient resources to provide payoffs.

This strategy aims to prevent premature depletion of the stock while allowing you to benefit from higher payoffs when possible. It's a heuristic approach that doesn't require knowledge of other players' strategies but balances individual gain with resource sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_148 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create a rule-based approach that adapts based on the stock level and round number. The goal is to cooperate when beneficial and defect when necessary to maximize payoffs without relying on others' cooperation.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This sets an initial high stock level, encouraging sustainability.
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - If the current stock is above half of the capacity, continue Cooperating (C) to maintain a sustainable resource.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting (D) for all subsequent rounds to exploit the remaining resource before depletion.
3. **Last Round:** Always Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds, prioritize immediate payoff.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity):
    current_stock = capacity  # Initial stock level
    strategy_history = []
    
    for round in range(1, r + 1):

            action = "C"
        elif round == r:
            action = "D"
        else:

        # Update stock based on actions (assuming others' actions affect it, but here we focus on our strategy)
    
    return strategy_history
```

### Explanation:

- **First Round:** Starting with cooperation sets a high stock level, potentially encouraging others to follow suit.
- **Middle Rounds:** Monitoring the stock level ensures that if cooperation isn't maintained, the strategy shifts to defecting, preventing being exploited by others' defection.
- **Last Round:** Defecting ensures maximum immediate gain since future rounds don't matter.

This approach balances cooperation for sustainability with strategic defection when necessary, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Behavior:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline and observe others' initial actions.

2. **Monitoring and Tracking:**
   - Track the number of defections (D) each player has made in previous rounds.
   - Calculate the average payoff per round to assess stock sustainability.

3. **Adaptive Strategy Based on History and State:**
   - **High Stock Levels (>75% of capacity):** 
     - If the majority (>50%) of players cooperated recently, continue cooperating.
     - If significant defections are observed (≥50%), switch to defecting to maximize payoffs.
   - **Low Stock Levels (<25% of capacity):**
     - Prioritize defecting to secure remaining resources, as conservation may no longer be viable.

4. **Punishment and Rehabilitation Mechanism:**
   - Implement a "Tit-for-Tat" approach: if a player defects, respond with defection in the next round.
   - After punishing defectors, revert to cooperation if others start cooperating again to rebuild stock.

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as future rounds do not matter.
   - **Near Zero Stock:** Defect to capture any remaining resources since conservation is less critical.
   - **At Capacity:** Encourage cooperation to maintain a sustainable stock level for future rounds.

6. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Continuously assess the number of defections and average payoffs to adapt strategy each round, ensuring responsiveness to changing behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to adapt based on game state, history, and opponents' actions, balancing immediate gain with long-term sustainability.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to initialize stock growth and observe others' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Level:** Track the current stock after consumption and regeneration.
   - **Observe Opponent Actions:** Calculate the proportion of players who defected in the previous round.

4. **Punishment Mechanism:** 
   - If a significant number (e.g., more than half) of players defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to deter future defection.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**

    return total_payoff
```

### Summary:

This strategy starts cooperatively to build trust and stock, then adapts by monitoring the stock level and others' actions. It defects when exploitation is detected or when the game nears its end, ensuring a balance between immediate gain and future sustainability. This approach aims to exploit cooperative behavior while protecting against excessive defection, making it robust in competitive settings.

To address the dilemma of optimizing payoffs while preserving resources, the strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection. Here's how:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating to encourage others and maintain a high resource level.

2. **Adaptive Response**:
   - If past defections are frequent (average >50%), defect to avoid being exploited.
   - If resources drop below half capacity, cooperate to replenish them.

3. **Endgame Maximization**: In the final round, always defect to secure maximum immediate gain without future consequences.

This approach ensures early cooperation, adapts to others' actions, and maximizes endgame payoffs.

**Answer:** The optimal strategy is to start by cooperating, then adapt based on historical defections and resource levels. Defect if others often defect or in the final round, otherwise cooperate to maintain resources.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_152 = '''
To address the problem, we designed an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adaptively responds to both the game's state and opponents' actions. This approach aims to maximize individual payoffs while preserving the resource for future rounds when beneficial.

### Strategy Design:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to observe others' behavior without immediately depleting resources.
2. **Adaptive Response**:
   - If the stock level drops below a critical threshold (20% of capacity), switch to Cooperation to allow recovery.
   - Monitor opponents' actions, specifically focusing on the number of Defectors in the previous round.
   - If half or more players Defected in the last round, Defect in the current round unless the stock is critically low.
3. **Last Round Exploitation**: In the final round, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future stock to preserve.

        return "C"
    else:
        prev_defectors = sum(1 for action in prev_actions[-1] if action == "D")
        if prev_defectors >= n / 2:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
```

### Explanation:

- **First Round**: Cooperate to gather initial information on others' strategies.
- **Stock Conservation**: If the stock is critically low, Cooperate to allow recovery and sustain future rounds.
- **Responsive Defection**: Defect if a significant portion (at least half) of players defected in the previous round unless stock is too low, balancing immediate gain with resource preservation.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Maximize payoff in the last round by defecting, as there’s no future impact.

This strategy effectively balances cooperation and exploitation, adapting dynamically to maintain resource sustainability while capitalizing on opportunities for higher payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_153 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that balances exploitation with sustainability, we can outline the following approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy is adaptive and exploitative, designed to maximize payoffs by responding to opponents' behaviors and current stock levels. It begins cooperatively to gauge others' actions and adapts based on observed outcomes.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C) to observe the initial behavior of other players and assess their tendencies.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track the stock level after each round.
     - If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), continue cooperating if others are also cooperating, as there's sufficient resource to sustain exploitation.
     - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains while ensuring some resource remains for future rounds.

3. **Adaptation Based on History:**
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players based on past actions. If a significant number have defected historically, increase your defection rate to exploit their cooperation.
   - Use a moving average of recent payoffs to detect trends. If defecting yields higher payoffs without severely depleting the stock, continue defecting.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last round, always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact on the stock.

### Edge Cases:
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is critically low, prioritize cooperation temporarily to allow regrowth, ensuring future rounds have a sustainable resource.
- **High Cooperation by Others:** If most players consistently cooperate, defect strategically to exploit their cooperation without causing significant depletion.

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def strategy(game_state):
    if game_state['round'] == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        stock = game_state['current_stock']
        capacity = game_state['capacity']
        threshold = 0.7 * capacity
        
        if stock > threshold:
            # Check opponents' previous actions
            opponent_cooperations = sum(game_state['history']['cooperations'])
            avg_coop_rate = opponent_cooperations / (game_state['number_of_players'] * game_state['round'])
            
            if avg_coop_rate >= 0.5 and game_state['payoff_history'][-1] > stock/(2*game_state['n']):
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            # Consider switching based on payoff trends
            recent_payoffs = game_state['payoff_history']
            if len(recent_payoffs) >= 5:
                avg_last_five = sum(recent_payoffs[-5:]) / 5
                if avg_last_five > stock/(2*game_state['n']):
                    return 'D'
                else:
                    return 'C'
            else:
                # Default to defection when stock is low unless payoffs suggest otherwise
                return 'D'

    if game_state['round'] == game_state['total_rounds']:
        return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts by cooperating in the first round to observe others' actions and set a baseline for future decisions.
- **Stock Threshold Management:** By setting a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), the strategy balances exploitation with resource sustainability, switching to defection when it's safe to do so without causing severe depletion.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** The use of historical data on cooperation rates and recent payoffs allows the strategy to adapt dynamically, exploiting opponents who consistently cooperate while avoiding over-exploitation.
- **Endgame Defection:** Maximizes immediate payoff in the final round by defecting, as there are no future consequences for resource depletion.

This approach ensures that the strategy is both exploitative and robust, capable of responding effectively to various opponent behaviors while maintaining a sustainable resource for continued play.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_154 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that considers both immediate gains and long-term sustainability. The strategy must adapt to the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players. Here's how the strategy is structured:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C) to encourage a cooperative environment and maximize initial mutual benefits.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Stock Level Check**: Determine if the current stock is above or below half of the capacity.
     - If `stock <= capacity/2`, prioritize sustainability by Cooperating, especially when fewer than half of the players defected in the previous round.
     - If `stock > capacity/2`, exploit the higher stock level by Defecting to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Defection Response**: If a significant number (>= n/2) of players defected in the previous round, switch to Defecting to avoid being exploited.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Always Defect (D) in the final round to secure the highest possible immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

This strategy ensures that you balance between preserving the stock when necessary and exploiting it when opportunities arise, while also responding to others' actions to avoid being taken advantage of. The approach is robust against various player behaviors and maximizes your total payoff over the game's duration.

### Pseudocode Representation

```pseudocode
Initialize:
    action_history = empty list
    stock_current = initial_stock

For each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        prev_actions = get previous round actions
        D_count = count of players who chose D in prev_actions
        stock_current = current stock level
        
        if t == r:
            action = D
        else:
            if stock_current <= capacity/2 and D_count < n/2:
                action = C
            else:
                action = D
    append action to action_history
```

This structured approach ensures you adaptively exploit the game's dynamics while maintaining a balance towards sustainability, optimizing your overall payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_155 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round of the game, we've developed a strategy that balances exploiting others' cooperation with preserving the stock for future rounds. This approach ensures that we maximize our gain while maintaining the sustainability of the resource.

**Strategy:**

1. **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
   - Reasoning: Start by cooperating to avoid immediate depletion and gather initial data on how others behave.

2. For Rounds 2 to r-1:
   a. Calculate k_prev, the number of players who Defected in the previous round.
      - This is done using the total consumption from the previous round (Ct_prev) and the stock before that round (St_prev).
      - Formula: \( k_{prev} = 2n \times \left(\frac{C_{t-1}}{S_{t-1}}\right) - n \)
   b. If the current stock (S_t) is below a critical threshold (e.g., capacity/(2n)), Cooperate to help replenish the stock.
   c. Else, if k_prev > n/2, Defect to take advantage of others' cooperation.
   d. Otherwise, Cooperate.

3. **Last Round (Round r):** Always Defect.
   - Reasoning: In the final round, there’s no future stock to preserve, so maximize immediate gain by defecting.

This strategy adaptively responds to both the behavior of other players and the current state of the resource, aiming to optimize individual payoffs while considering collective sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_156 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game with a shared resource (the stock), we can outline a strategy based on observed behavior and current state. The goal is to maximize personal payoff while considering future implications.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning:** Starting by cooperating helps maintain the stock at its maximum capacity, ensuring higher potential payoffs in subsequent rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to R-1):**
   - **Condition Check:** 
     - Calculate the proportion of players who defected in previous rounds (`history_defect_rate`).
     - Assess the current stock level (`S_current`) relative to capacity.
   - **Decision:**
     - If `S_current` is below 50% of capacity or if `history_defect_rate` exceeds 50%, choose to defect.
     - Otherwise, continue cooperating.

3. **Last Round (Round R):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Reasoning:** In the final round, prioritize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Explanation:

- **Cooperation in Early Rounds:** By starting with cooperation, we aim to keep the stock high, which benefits everyone. This sets a foundation for sustainable play if others follow suit.
  
- **Adaptive Strategy:** As the game progresses, the strategy adapts based on others' actions and the stock's health. If too many players defect or the stock significantly depletes, switching to defection prevents losing out in the current round and future ones.

- **Endgame Focus:** Recognizing that the last round offers no future consequences, defecting ensures capturing maximum immediate benefit without worrying about sustainability.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, adapting dynamically based on collective behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_157 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for a multi-round game where players can either Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), we aim to balance maximizing immediate payoffs with preserving the resource for future rounds. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish trust and maintain a high stock level.
2. **Monitor Past Actions**: Track the number of defectors in recent rounds to gauge overall cooperation levels.
3. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Switch to defecting if past defections are high or if the stock is significantly depleted.
4. **Penultimate Round Cooperation**: Cooperate in the second-to-last round to preserve stock for the final round.
5. **Final Round Defection**: Always defect in the last round to maximize the final payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Decision Rules
1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C).
2. **Rounds 2 to r-2**:
   - Calculate the average number of defectors in the last three rounds.
   - If the average exceeds half the number of players or if the stock is below a critical threshold, Defect (D) next round; otherwise, Cooperate (C).
3. **Round r-1**: Cooperate to preserve stock for the final round.
4. **Final Round (r)**: Always Defect (D).

### Pseudocode
```python
def determine_actions(n, r, capacity):
    actions = []
    stock_history = [capacity]
    defector_count_history = []

    for t in range(1, r + 1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'C'
        elif t == r:
            action = 'D'
        elif t == r - 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            window_size = min(3, len(defector_count_history))
            recent_defectors = sum(defector_count_history[-window_size:]) if window_size > 0 else 0
            avg_defectors = recent_defectors / window_size if window_size > 0 else 0

            stock_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
            defect_condition = (avg_defectors > n / 2) or (stock_history[-1] < stock_threshold)

            action = 'D' if defect_condition else 'C'

        actions.append(action)
        # Update histories with actual defector counts from other players, which would be known in real play
        # For simulation purposes, assume current action doesn't affect others immediately
    return actions

# Example usage:
n_players = 4
rounds = 5
capacity = 100
actions = determine_actions(n_players, rounds, capacity)
print(actions)  # Output: ['C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D']
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages others to cooperate and maintains a high stock.
- **Monitoring Defectors**: Adjusts strategy based on recent behavior, defecting if exploitation is evident.
- **Stock Preservation**: Prevents premature depletion by cooperating when the stock is critically low.
- **Final Round Maximization**: Ensures maximum payoff in the last round without future consequences.

This approach balances cooperation to sustain resources with strategic defection to maximize individual gain, especially towards the game's end.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_158 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This initial move sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of other players' behaviors without immediate depletion.
   
2. **Adaptation Based on History and State:**
   - Track the number of times each player has defected in previous rounds. If the majority (more than 50%) have defected consistently, switch to Defect (D) to exploit their over-harvesting behavior.
   - Monitor the stock level after each round. If the stock falls below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), begin defecting to maximize immediate payoffs as the resource becomes scarce.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - In the last round, always Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds, prioritize maximizing current payoff without concern for sustainability.
   - If the stock is depleted to zero, continue defecting in subsequent rounds as cooperation yields nothing when the stock is already exhausted.

4. **Exploitative Mindset:**
   - Continuously assess the balance between preserving the resource and exploiting others' strategies. Adjust actions dynamically to capitalize on cooperative behavior while protecting against over-depletion.
   - Use a threshold-based system to determine when to shift strategies, ensuring responsiveness to both stock levels and opponents' actions.

**Pseudocode Overview:**

```
Initialize:
    cooperate_count = 0
    defect_count = 0
    previous_stock = capacity

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round:
        choose C
    else:
        assess history:
            count_defections = number of players who defected in past rounds
            current_stock_level = state.stock
        
        if last round:
            choose D
        elif (count_defections > n/2) or (current_stock_level < threshold):
            choose D
        else:
            choose C

    update counts and stock level based on actions taken
```

This strategy dynamically adjusts between cooperation and defection, aiming to exploit others' greed while preserving resource sustainability where beneficial.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_159 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Start with cooperation to establish a baseline and minimize initial impact on the stock, encouraging others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Previous Round Metrics:**
     - Calculate the total consumption in the previous round as a percentage of the capacity.
     - Check the stock level after growth in the previous round relative to capacity.
   
   - **Decision Rules:**
     - If the previous round's total consumption exceeds 30% of capacity, switch to Defect (D) in the current round. This indicates high exploitation, so maximize immediate payoff.
     - If the stock after growth is below 50% of capacity, defect to exploit the remaining resource before significant depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect (D)
     - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds and thus no need to preserve the stock for later use.

**Adaptive Mechanism:**
- The strategy continuously assesses the health of the common pool through measurable metrics, adjusting behavior to exploit high consumption patterns while preserving resource sustainability when possible.
- By focusing on observable data like stock levels and consumption rates, the strategy remains robust against various opponent behaviors without relying on coordination or norms.

This approach balances exploitation with conservation, aiming to maximize individual payoffs while considering the dynamic state of the shared resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_160 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that leverages cooperation when beneficial but switches to defection as the game progresses or when others defect. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and History

1. **First Round Action**: Always Cooperate (C). This initializes the stock at its maximum capacity and allows observation of other players' initial actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: If the current stock level is below 50% of the capacity, switch to Defecting (D) for the remainder of the game.
   - **Cooperation Threshold Calculation**: Compute a dynamic cooperation threshold based on the remaining rounds. The threshold increases as the game progresses, making it harder to choose Cooperate over time.
     - `threshold = 0.5 + 0.5 * (current_round / total_rounds)`
   - **Historical Cooperation Check**: Calculate the average rate of cooperation from previous rounds. If this rate meets or exceeds the dynamic threshold and the stock is above 50%, continue Cooperating; otherwise, Defect.

3. **Last Round Action**: Always choose to Defect (D) in the final round to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
Initialize:
    total_cooperations = 0
    strategy_name = "AdaptiveExploitation"

For each round t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = "C"
    else if t == r:
        action = "D"
    else:
        S_current = get_current_stock_level()
        avg_coop = total_cooperations / (n * (t - 1))
        remaining_ratio = t / r
        coop_threshold = 0.5 + 0.5 * remaining_ratio
        
        if S_current > capacity / 2 and avg_coop >= coop_threshold:
            action = "C"
        else:
            action = "D"
    
    # Observe other players' actions and update total_cooperations
    current_actions = get_other_players_actions()
    total_cooperations += sum(1 for action in current_actions if action == "C")
    
    return action
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation maximizes the stock's growth potential and allows us to gauge others' strategies.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: As the game progresses, the threshold for cooperation increases, reflecting the diminishing returns of sustaining the stock as the end approaches.
- **Stock Level Consideration**: Defecting when the stock is low ensures that we don't miss out on higher immediate payoffs when the stock can't sustain future rounds effectively.
- **Historical Behavior Adaptation**: By adjusting based on past cooperation rates, the strategy remains responsive to others' actions, exploiting their cooperation while protecting against exploitation.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to both the game's progression and other players' behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_161 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy in a repeated game where players can choose to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), we need a balanced approach that considers both immediate gains and long-term sustainability. The goal is to exploit others' behavior while protecting against exploitation, especially as the game progresses towards its conclusion.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and encourage reciprocal behavior from other players.
   
2. **Adaptive Response Based on Previous Actions**:
   - Track the number of players who defected in each previous round.
   - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, switch to defecting in the current round to avoid being exploited.
   - Additionally, if the stock level drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains since sustainability appears unfeasible.

3. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last few rounds (e.g., the final 10% or last 5 rounds), always choose to defect. This prioritizes short-term gains as there are no future rounds left to protect, making long-term conservation less relevant.

### Detailed Strategy Breakdown

1. **First Round**:
   - Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and observe others' reactions.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - Count the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - If the number of defectors exceeds 50% of the total players, choose D for the current round.
   - Monitor the stock level; if it falls below a critical threshold (e.g., capacity/2n), switch to defecting to secure immediate benefits.
   - If both conditions are not met, continue cooperating.

3. **Final Rounds**:
   - In the last 10% of rounds or the final 5 rounds, always choose D to maximize endgame payoffs without concern for future sustainability.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages others to reciprocate and builds a foundation for potential mutual cooperation.
- **Adaptive Response**: Punishes widespread defection by joining defectors, preventing being exploited. It also shifts focus to immediate gains when stock is low, as future benefits seem unlikely.
- **Endgame Defection**: Prioritizes maximizing current payoffs in the absence of future rounds, ensuring no missed opportunities for gain.

### Conclusion

This strategy balances cooperation and defection dynamically, adapting to others' behavior and the game's progression. It seeks to exploit when beneficial while protecting against exploitation, ensuring a competitive yet flexible approach throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_162 = '''
To design an effective exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll adopt a structured approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's the organized plan:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability (AES)

1. **Initial Cooperation Baseline:**
   - Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of others' behavior and to avoid initial depletion.

2. **Monitor and Punish Defectors:**
   - Track the average cooperation rate of other players over recent rounds.
   - If the majority defect, increase defection to exploit their higher consumption without depleting resources excessively.

3. **Stock Level Adjustments:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level relative to capacity.
   - When stock is high (above 75% of capacity), defect more to maximize payoffs safely.
   - When stock is low (below 25%), cooperate to conserve and allow regrowth, ensuring future rounds' sustainability.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds), transition towards more defection to maximize immediate gains, as future stock isn't a concern.
   - On the final round, defect fully to secure maximum payoff.

5. **Robustness and Adaptation:**
   - Use moving averages of cooperation rates to smooth reactions to temporary fluctuations, preventing overreaction.
   - Incorporate thresholds based on the number of players (n) to scale responses appropriately, ensuring collective impact is managed.

6. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If stock drops critically low, switch to full cooperation temporarily to allow recovery, preventing irreversible depletion.

### Decision Rules Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, round_num, total_rounds, past_actions):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    
    recent_coop_rate = calculate_recent_cooperation(past_actions)
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    
    if round_num > total_rounds - 3:  # Last few rounds
        return "D"
    elif round_num == total_rounds:   # Final round
        return "D"
    else:
        if recent_coop_rate < 0.5:  # Majority defected recently
            defect_probability = 0.8
        else:
            defect_probability = 0.2
        
        if stock_ratio > 0.75:
            defect_probability += 0.2
        elif stock_ratio < 0.25:
            defect_probability -= 0.2
            
        if random.random() < defect_probability:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

def calculate_recent_cooperation(past_actions):
    window_size = min(5, len(past_actions))
    recent_actions = past_actions[-window_size:]
    coop_count = sum(1 for action in recent_actions if action == 'C')
    return coop_count / (len(recent_actions) * 0.5)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a cooperative tone and gathers initial data on others' behaviors.
- **Punish Defectors:** Adjusts strategy based on others' recent actions, balancing exploitation with sustainability.
- **Stock Level Management:** Ensures that exploitation doesn't compromise future rounds by conserving when necessary.
- **Endgame Maximization:** Prioritizes immediate gains towards the end without worrying about stock replenishment.
- **Adaptation and Smoothing:** Uses moving averages to prevent overreactions, ensuring stable strategy adjustment.

This strategy aims to exploit others' cooperation while maintaining a sustainable resource level for continued play, adapting dynamically based on both historical actions and current state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_163 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we can structure our approach based on the key insights and considerations outlined. The strategy should adapt to the game's state and history while being robust against diverse opponent behaviors.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Trends

1. **Initial Round (Round 1)**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate.
     - **Rationale**: Start by cooperating to establish a sustainable stock level and observe others' actions without immediately exploiting the resource.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Monitor Stock Trends**:
     - Calculate the average stock growth over the past few rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds) to determine if the stock is increasing or decreasing.
   - **Decision Rules**:
     - If the stock level is above a threshold (e.g., capacity/2) and the trend indicates growth, continue Cooperating. This sustains the resource for future payoffs.
     - If the stock falls below the threshold or shows a declining trend, switch to Defecting. This maximizes immediate payoff when others are likely exploiting the resource.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**:
   - **Action**: Always Defect.
     - **Rationale**: In the final round, there's no future benefit from preserving the stock, so defecting ensures the maximum possible payoff in that round.

4. **Adaptive Thresholds**:
   - Use a moving average of past stock levels to smooth out fluctuations and accurately determine growth trends.
   - Adjust the cooperation threshold dynamically based on observed opponent behaviors and stock dynamics.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold (e.g., capacity/2) can be adjusted based on the number of players and rounds, ensuring flexibility across different game parameter settings.
- **Trend Analysis**: Implement a simple moving average or exponential smoothing to assess stock trends without requiring complex computations.
- **Opponent Behavior**: While direct observation of others' actions is possible, focus on the aggregate impact (total consumption) to infer collective behavior and adjust strategies accordingly.

### Pseudocode

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, round, history):

        avg_recent_stock = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
        
        if current_stock > capacity/2 and avg_recent_stock >= current_stock:
            return "C"

# Example usage
n = 4

capacity = 100
current_stock = 75

```

### Summary

This strategy balances the need to sustain resources for future payoffs with the imperative to maximize immediate gains when others are exploiting. By monitoring stock trends and adapting actions dynamically, it ensures robustness against various opponent strategies while maintaining an exploitative edge.

To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we developed a dynamic approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize payoffs while considering the game's state and history.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation Strategy (AES)

The AES is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, focusing on maximizing individual payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability. It adapts based on stock levels and historical data without relying on coordination or communication.

#### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C). This sets a baseline for observing others' behavior and encouraging potential cooperation.

2. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - **Threshold High (70% of Capacity):** If the stock is above this level, continue cooperating to maintain sustainability.
   - **Threshold Low (50% of Capacity):** If the stock falls below this level, switch to defecting (D) to exploit the resource before it depletes further.

3. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Monitor the stock's trend over past rounds. If there's a consistent decline despite cooperation, consider switching to defection earlier than the threshold to prevent significant depletion.

4. **Last Round Exploitation:**
   - In the final round (r), always defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future consequences are irrelevant.

5. **Recovery Monitoring:**
   - After switching to defection, continue monitoring the stock. If it recovers above Threshold High, revert to cooperation to sustain the resource for potential future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy Parameters(n, r, capacity), state(stock, round t):
    if t == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        threshold_high = 0.7 * capacity
        threshold_low = 0.5 * capacity

        # Check stock against thresholds and trend
        if stock < threshold_low or stock_trend == 'declining':
            action = 'D'
        elif stock > threshold_high and stock_trend == 'stable' or 'increasing':
            action = 'C'
        else:
            # Default to cooperation unless conditions for defection are met
            action = 'C'

    if t == r:
        action = 'D'

    return action

# Stock trend determination function (example)
def determine_stock_trend(history):
    # Calculate the slope of stock levels over past rounds
    # Return 'increasing', 'stable', or 'declining'
```

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
- **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff.
- **Stock Recovery:** Revert to cooperation if the stock recovers above Threshold High after defection.

This strategy is exploitative, adaptive, and robust, aiming to balance short-term gains with long-term resource sustainability based on observable game state dynamics.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Preservation (AES)

The AES strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs by adaptively responding to opponents' actions while preserving the common resource for future exploitation. It combines elements of reciprocity and stock conservation to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round Strategy:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Encourage initial cooperation to establish a high payoff baseline and promote potential mutual cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Strategy:**
   - **Monitor Previous Round's Cooperation Level:**
     - Calculate the number of players who Defected in the previous round.
   - **Determine Current Action Based on Previous Behavior:**
     - If more than half of the players Defected last round, switch to Defecting (D) to avoid being exploited.
     - Otherwise, continue with the same action as the previous round.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - After each round, assess the stock level after consumption and growth.
   - If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to Cooperate (C) to facilitate resource replenishment for future rounds.

4. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - In the last round, if the current strategy would be Defect but the stock is low, consider switching to Cooperate to maximize final payoff by leaving a higher remaining stock.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and avoid immediate resource depletion.
- **Last Round:** Evaluate the trade-off between immediate gain and stock preservation. If stock is critically low, prioritize cooperation to ensure a meaningful final payoff.
- **Low Stock Scenario:** When the stock is depleted significantly, prioritize resource replenishment by Cooperating, even if others Defect, ensuring future rounds have a sustainable base.

### Strategy Pseudocode

```python
def aes_strategy(game_state, history):
    current_round = game_state['round']
    n = game_state['n']
    capacity = game_state['capacity']
    stock = game_state['stock']
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    previous_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
    
    if num_defectors > n / 2:
        # Switch to Defect if majority defected last round
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Continue with the same action as last round, unless stock is critical
        if stock < 0.25 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        else:
            # Maintain previous action unless in final round and stock is low
            if current_round == game_state['total_rounds']:
                if stock < 0.5 * capacity:
                    return 'C'
                else:
                    return 'D'
            else:
                return history[-1]['own_action']
```

### Strategy Explanation

The AES strategy begins by Cooperating in the first round to encourage a high initial payoff and set a cooperative precedent. In subsequent rounds, it monitors the number of Defectors from the previous round. If a majority Defected, the strategy switches to Defecting to avoid exploitation. However, if the stock level becomes critically low, the strategy prioritizes cooperation to replenish the resource, ensuring sustainability for future gains. This adaptive approach balances reciprocity with resource preservation, aiming to exploit opponents' behaviors effectively while safeguarding against resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_166 = '''
To design an effective exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to consider both immediate payoffs and long-term sustainability. The strategy should adapt based on the history of opponents' actions and the current state of the stock.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACST)

1. **First Round Decision**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate.
   - **Rationale**: Starting with cooperation encourages others to cooperate, potentially leading to higher sustained payoffs.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Not Last Round)**:
   - **Track History**: Maintain a weighted average of opponents' past actions, giving more weight to recent rounds.
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: If the stock is below 50% of capacity, switch to cooperation to allow recovery.
   - **Cooperation Rate Evaluation**: Calculate the average cooperation rate. If it's above 70%, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect.

3. **Last Round Decision**:
   - **Action**: Always Defect.
   - **Rationale**: In the final round, maximizing immediate payoff is optimal since there are no future consequences.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_strategy(game_state):
    if game_state['round'] == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif game_state['round'] == game_state['total_rounds']:
        return 'D'
    else:
        stock = game_state['current_stock']
        capacity = game_state['capacity']
        avg_coop_rate = calculate_weighted_average_cooperation()
        
        if stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return 'C'
        elif avg_coop_rate > 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

def calculate_weighted_average_cooperation(history):
    weights = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]  # Example weights for past 4 rounds
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(history)):
        coop_count = sum(1 for action in history[i] if action == 'C')
        avg_coop = coop_count / len(game_state['players'])
        total += avg_coop * weights[i]
    return total / sum(weights)
```

### Explanation:

- **Adaptability**: The strategy adjusts based on recent behavior and stock levels, ensuring it can respond to changes in opponents' actions.
- **Sustainability**: By cooperating when the stock is low, it helps maintain a healthy resource for future rounds.
- **Exploitation**: Defecting when others are not cooperating or in the last round maximizes immediate gains without compromising long-term benefits.

This strategy balances cooperation and defection to exploit opponents' behavior while preserving the common pool resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_167 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round of the game, we can adopt a strategy that balances exploiting cooperation from others while ensuring the stock does not deplete too much. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **First Round**: Start by Cooperating (C). This sets a high initial stock level and encourages other players to cooperate as well.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (from Round 2 to Round r-1)**:
   - **High Stock Level (>75% of Capacity)**: If the stock after the previous round is above 75% of its capacity, Defect (D). This allows you to exploit others' cooperation without causing significant depletion.
   - **Low Stock Level (<50% of Capacity)**: If the stock drops below 50%, Cooperate (C) to help replenish it and prevent further depletion.
   - **Moderate Stock Level (50-75% of Capacity)**: Alternate between C and D, starting with C in Round 2. This helps maintain a balance without over-exploiting.

3. **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) to maximize your immediate payoff since there are no future consequences beyond this round.

This strategy ensures that you exploit high cooperation from others while conserving resources when necessary and maximizing final-round gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_168 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll employ a strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on historical behavior and the current state of the stock. The goal is to maximize total payoffs by encouraging mutual cooperation while avoiding exploitation.

### Strategy: Reciprocative Threshold with Stock Consideration (RTSC)

1. **First Round**: Always cooperate to encourage initial mutual cooperation.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Check**: If the current stock level is below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), cooperate to help replenish the stock, regardless of historical defections.
   - **Historical Defection Check**: If the stock is above the threshold, calculate the proportion of players who defected in the previous round. Cooperate if less than half defected; otherwise, defect to avoid being exploited.
3. **Last Round**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a tone for mutual benefit and encourages others to reciprocate.
- **Stock Preservation**: When the stock is low, prioritizing its recovery ensures sustainable payoffs in subsequent rounds.
- **Reciprocal Response**: Adjusting behavior based on previous actions incentivizes others to maintain cooperation, discouraging excessive exploitation.
- **Final Round Maximization**: In the last round, immediate gain is prioritized as there are no future consequences.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize with cooperation in the first round.
2. For each subsequent round:
   - If stock < threshold → Cooperate.
   - Else, if proportion of previous defectors ≥ 50% → Defect.
   - Else → Cooperate.
3. In the final round → Always defect.

This strategy adaptively responds to both the game's state and players' behaviors, aiming to sustain cooperation while protecting against exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_169 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Experimentation Phase (First 20% of Rounds):** Start with a mix of Cooperate (C) and Defect (D). For example, choose C 50% of the time to test others' reactions without overly depleting resources.
   - **Reciprocation Phase:** After initial rounds, calculate the average cooperation rate of other players. If they cooperate more than 70%, increase your cooperation; if less than 30%, defect more.
   - **Conservation Threshold (Stock < 20% of Capacity):** Switch to Cooperate to prevent stock depletion, ensuring future payoffs aren't jeopardized.
   - **Exploitation Phase (Last 10% of Rounds):** Defect to maximize immediate gains since future rounds are limited.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate moderately to observe others' tendencies without aggressive depletion.
   - **Low Stock Situations:** Prioritize stock conservation by cooperating unless in the final phase, where defecting is favored.
   - **Endgame (Last Few Rounds):** Focus on maximizing immediate payoffs through defection as future consequences are minimal.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - Continuously monitor others' actions and adjust strategy to exploit their tendencies, balancing between cooperation for sustainability and defection for higher gains.
   - Use thresholds and moving averages to smoothly transition strategies based on observed behavior and stock levels.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
function decide_action(round, history, current_stock):
    if round <= 0.2 * total_rounds:
        return random.choice([C, D])  # Experimentation
    else:
        avg_coop = calculate_average_cooperation(history)
        if avg_coop > 0.7:
            return C
        elif avg_coop < 0.3:
            return D
        else:
            if current_stock < 0.2 * capacity and round > 0.9 * total_rounds:
                return D  # Exploit in endgame
            elif current_stock < 0.2 * capacity:
                return C  # Conserve
            else:
                return D  # Default to exploit

# Example thresholds: 20% for experimentation, 70% and 30% cooperation rates, 20% stock threshold.
```

This strategy adaptively responds to opponents' actions and the game's state, balancing exploitation with resource conservation to maximize total payoff over the game's duration.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_170 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitative Approach for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Purpose:** Establish a baseline of cooperation and observe other players' initial behavior.

2. **Tracking Others' Behavior:**
   - **Monitor Past Actions:** Track the number of players who defected in each round.
   - **Threshold Check:** If more than 50% of players defected in the previous round, switch to defecting (D) for the next two rounds as a punitive measure.

3. **Stock-Level Adaptation:**
   - **Current Stock Evaluation:** Before deciding on an action, evaluate the current stock level.
   - **Thresholds:**
     - If stock is below 30% of capacity, cooperate (C) to help replenish the resource.
     - If stock is between 30% and 70% of capacity, decide based on others' past actions using the threshold check above.
     - If stock exceeds 70%, consider defecting (D) more liberally while monitoring others' behavior.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - **Last Two Rounds:** Always defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs since there are no future consequences.

5. **Robustness and Adaptation:**
   - Continuously monitor the number of defectors and adjust accordingly.
   - If cooperation is restored after punitive measures, revert to cooperation gradually based on observed behavior.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
Initialize:
    cooperate_count = True
    past_defections = 0

For each round from 1 to r:
    if current_round <= 2:
        action = C
    else:
        previous_defection_rate = past_defections / n
        current_stock_level = S_current / capacity
        
        if previous_defection_rate > 0.5 and stock_level > 0.3:
            action = D for next two rounds
        elif current_stock_level < 0.3:
            action = C
        else:
            calculate expected payoff based on past actions
            choose action (C or D) with higher expected payoff

    if last_two_rounds:
        action = D

    execute action and update past_defections
```

This strategy balances punitive measures against defectors, manages stock levels to prevent depletion, and maximizes payoffs in the endgame. It adapts based on observed behavior and current resource conditions, aiming to exploit others' actions while maintaining resource sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_171 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed a structured approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. This strategy is adaptive, considering both the current state of the stock and the actions of other players.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to observe others' initial moves without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Decision Rules:**
     - **Cooperate (C)** if either of the following conditions is met:
       - The current stock level is below 50% of the capacity.
       - More than half of the players defected in the previous round.
     - **Defect (D)** otherwise to exploit the resource for higher immediate payoffs when it's sustainable.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for.

### Strategy Details:

- **Monitoring and Adaptation:** Continuously monitor the stock level and the number of players defecting each round. Adjust actions based on these observations to balance exploitation with conservation.
- **Threshold-Based Approach:** Use a 50% stock threshold relative to capacity as a trigger for cooperation to aid in regrowth, ensuring that the resource isn't overly depleted.
- **Exploitative Mindset:** Prioritize higher payoffs when sustainable, defecting when it's beneficial without jeopardizing future rounds excessively.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(stock, round, total_rounds, prev_actions):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        if stock < 0.5 * capacity or sum(prev_actions) / len(prev_actions) > 0.5:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

### Conclusion:

This strategy aims to exploit the common pool resource effectively by adapting to both the stock's condition and other players' behaviors. It ensures that while we aim for maximum payoffs, we also contribute to the sustainability of the resource when necessary, avoiding premature depletion that could harm future gains.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Conservation

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation serves as a signal and allows observation of other players' actions without immediate exploitation.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds (Before Last Round):**
  - If the current stock level is **above** 75% of capacity, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff while the stock is plentiful.
  - If the current stock level is **below or equal to** 25% of capacity, Cooperate (C) to conserve the resource for future rounds.
  - For stock levels between 25% and 75%, observe the number of players who defected in the previous round:
    - If more than half defected, Cooperate (C) to prevent further depletion.
    - Otherwise, Defect (D) to exploit the resource while it's moderately stocked.

- **Last Round:** Always Defect (D). Since there are no future rounds, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff without concern for stock replenishment.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of behavior and observe others' actions.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate when the stock is critically low to ensure some resource remains for future exploitation.
- **Last Round:** Maximize payoff by defecting, as there’s no future consequence.

#### 3. Exploitative Approach:
The strategy is designed to exploit high stock levels while conserving during times of scarcity. By adapting based on the stock level and opponents' past behavior, it aims to balance immediate gains with long-term resource availability, making it robust against diverse strategies.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(round, stock, capacity, history):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    if round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    
    stock_ratio = stock / capacity
    
    if stock_ratio > 0.75:

    elif stock_ratio <= 0.25:
        return "C"

total_rounds = r
current_round = t
stock = current_stock_level
capacity = game_capacity
history = list_of_previous_actions

action = decide_action(current_round, stock, capacity, history)
```

### Conclusion:

This strategy is adaptive and exploitative, balancing cooperation to sustain the resource with defection to maximize payoffs. It dynamically adjusts based on the current state and opponents' past actions, ensuring robustness in various scenarios.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Trends and Cooperation

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C).  
  - Rationale: Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial payoffs, which encourages others to cooperate as well.

- **Subsequent Rounds:**  
  - **If the stock level is above 75% of capacity:** Cooperate (C).  
    - Rationale: The resource is being managed sustainably; continued cooperation maintains high payoffs for all.  
  - **If the stock level is below 25% of capacity:** Defect (D).  
    - Rationale: The resource is severely depleted, and defecting maximizes your immediate payoff since cooperation may no longer be mutually beneficial.  
  - **If the stock level is between 25% and 75% of capacity:**  
    - Use a **trend-based rule** to decide whether to cooperate or defect:  
      - Calculate the average stock growth/decay over the last `k` rounds (e.g., k=3).  
      - If the trend indicates **stock is increasing**, Cooperate (C).  
        - Rationale: Others are cooperating, and the resource is recovering; maintaining cooperation is beneficial.  
      - If the trend indicates **stock is decreasing**, Defect (D).  
        - Rationale: Others may be defecting, so defecting protects your payoff while signaling to others that cooperation is not reciprocated.  

**2. Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and maximize initial payoffs.  
- **Last Round (r):** Defect (D).  
  - Rationale: In the final round, there is no future stock to protect, so maximizing immediate payoff takes precedence over long-term sustainability.  
- **Stock at Capacity:** If the stock is exactly at capacity, Cooperate (C) if others are also cooperating; otherwise, Defect (D).  

**3. Exploitative Mindset:**

This strategy aligns with an exploitative mindset by:
- **Adapting to Opponent Behavior:** The trend-based rule allows the strategy to exploit cooperative behavior when possible while defecting when opponents are overexploiting the resource.  
- **Protecting Payoffs:** By defecting when the stock is low, the strategy ensures that you do not suffer unduly from others' defection.  
- **Encouraging Cooperation:** By cooperating when the stock is high and increasing, the strategy incentivizes others to maintain cooperation.  

### Pseudocode Example:
```python
def decide_action(stock_history, current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return "D"  # Defect in the last round
    
    # Calculate stock trend over the last k rounds
    k = min(3, len(stock_history))
    recent_stocks = stock_history[-k:]
    average_stock_change = (sum(recent_stocks) - current_stock) / k
    
    if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
        return "C"  # Cooperate if stock is high
    elif current_stock < 0.25 * capacity:
        return "D"  # Defect if stock is critically low
    else:
        if average_stock_change > 0:  # Stock is increasing
            return "C"
        else:                       # Stock is decreasing
            return "D"

# Example usage in a round:
current_stock = 62.5
capacity = 100
stock_history = [100, 50, 25, 62.5]
round_number = 4
total_rounds = 10

action = decide_action(stock_history, current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds)
print(action)  # Output: "C" or "D"
```

This strategy is designed to balance cooperation and exploitation, ensuring robust performance across a wide range of opponent behaviors.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_176 = '''
To maximize payoffs while ensuring the sustainability of the resource, an effective strategy can be implemented based on the current stock level relative to half of the capacity. This approach is both adaptive and straightforward:

1. **First Round**: Always defect to secure a higher initial payoff.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (excluding the last)**:
   - Defect if the current stock is above half of the capacity.
   - Cooperate if the current stock is below or equal to half of the capacity to help replenish the resource.
3. **Last Round**: Always defect, as there are no future rounds to consider.

This strategy ensures that you maximize your payoffs when possible while contributing to the sustainability of the resource when necessary.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\text{Always defect in the first and last rounds. Defect in other rounds if the stock is above half capacity; otherwise, cooperate.}}

To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll employ a balanced approach that adapts based on the game's state and history. The strategy, named "Adaptive Exploitation," aims to maximize individual payoff while conserving the stock for future rounds.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **First Round Action**:
   - **Cooperate (C)**: Start by cooperating to encourage a cooperative tone and observe others' responses without immediately exploiting.

2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Stock Trends**: Track the average stock level over the past few rounds, say the last 3 rounds, to assess resource health.
   - **Threshold-Based Decision**:
     - If the average stock level falls below a threshold (e.g., capacity / 2), switch to Cooperate (C) to prevent depletion.
     - Otherwise, Defect (D) to maximize immediate gains while the stock is healthy.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - **Defect (D)**: In the final round, always defect to secure maximum immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

4. **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment**:
   - Continuously adjust the threshold based on observed trends. If the stock shows a consistent decline despite cooperation, lower the threshold to conserve more aggressively.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, total_rounds, history):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round_num == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    
    # Calculate average stock over the last few rounds (e.g., last 3)
    avg_stock = sum(history['stocks'][-min(3, len(history['stocks'])):]) / min(3, len(history['stocks']))
    threshold = capacity / 2
    
    if avg_stock < threshold:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

# Initialize history with stock levels
history = {'stocks': [capacity]}
for round in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    action = adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, history['stocks'][-1], round, total_rounds, history)
    # Simulate action and update stock
    # ... (game mechanics here)
    history['stocks'].append(new_stock)

```

### Strategy Explanation

- **First Round Cooperation**: Encourages initial cooperation to set a positive precedent.
- **Stock Trend Monitoring**: By averaging recent stock levels, the strategy identifies if the resource is under threat and adjusts accordingly.
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Dynamically changes conservation efforts based on observed depletion trends, ensuring adaptability.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Maximizes immediate gain without concern for future rounds.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to the behavior of other players while protecting against over-exploitation.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_178 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round (t=1)**: Cooperate to gather initial information on other players' behavior.
   - **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
     - Calculate the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     - If more than half of the players defected, choose Defect (D).
     - Otherwise, if the current stock is above 50% of capacity, choose Cooperate (C); otherwise, choose D.
   - **Last Round (t=r)**: Always choose Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock falls below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to Defecting regardless of others' actions.
   - **Stock at Capacity**: Cooperate if others are mostly cooperating; otherwise, Defect.

3. **Adaptive and Robust Approach**:
   - The strategy adapts based on both the stock level and opponents' past behavior, ensuring it is exploitative by taking advantage of cooperation when beneficial while defecting when necessary to maximize payoffs.
   - In the last round, always defecting ensures no missed opportunities for immediate gain.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while maintaining a focus on maximizing personal payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_179 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game effectively, we need a strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize payoffs while considering the dynamic state of the stock. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability (AES)

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C). This initializes trust and maximizes initial stock, encouraging others to cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Until Last**:
   - **Monitor Stock Levels**: Track the stock after each round.
   - **Threshold Check**: If the stock remains above 75% of capacity, continue Cooperating.
     - This threshold indicates that cooperation is effective in maintaining a healthy stock level.
   - **Switch to Defecting**: If the stock drops below 75%, switch to Defect (D) for subsequent rounds.
     - This prevents being exploited by defectors and ensures immediate payoffs when cooperation isn't maintained.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Always Defect (D). Since there are no future consequences, maximize immediate payoff without concern for stock depletion.

4. **Adaptive Mechanism**:
   - If after switching to Defecting the stock begins to recover and exceeds 75% capacity, revert to Cooperating.
     - This allows the strategy to adapt if others start cooperating again, ensuring sustainability when possible.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **Low Stock**: If the stock is critically low (e.g., below 25%), prioritize recovery by Cooperating temporarily, even if defectors are present.
   - **Stock Growth Trends**: Use moving averages of stock levels to identify trends rather than reacting to single-round fluctuations.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def aes_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round, total_rounds):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        previous_stock = history["stock_after"][round - 2]
        # Calculate stock change from previous to current after actions and growth
        stock_change = current_stock - previous_stock
        threshold = 0.75 * capacity
        if current_stock >= threshold:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"

def main(n, r, capacity):
    history = {"stock_after": [capacity]}  # Initialize with starting stock
    for t in range(1, r+1):
        if t == 1:
            action = "C"
        elif t == r:
            action = "D"
        else:

            if current_stock >= threshold:
                action = "C"
            else:
                action = "D"
        # Record action and update stock
        history["actions"].append(action)
    return history["actions"]
```

### Explanation

The AES strategy begins with cooperation to foster a sustainable stock level. It continuously assesses whether the stock is being maintained above a critical threshold, switching to defection when necessary to avoid exploitation. By monitoring trends and adapting actions based on stock health, this approach ensures both immediate gains and long-term sustainability, making it robust against various competitor strategies in the tournament.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_180 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we need a balanced approach that adapts to both the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players. The strategy should aim to maximize cumulative payoffs by sustainably managing the common resource while being robust against exploitation by others.

### Strategy Description

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Cooperation Threshold:** Cooperate unless the stock level falls below a certain threshold or a significant number of players have defected recently.
- **Defection Trigger:** Switch to defecting if either the stock drops below 50% of capacity or more than half of the players defected in the previous round.
- **Last Round Defection:** Always defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of behavior and observe others' actions.
- **Stock Recovery:** If after switching to defecting, the stock recovers above 50% without your contribution, reassess and consider reverting to cooperation if others are cooperating consistently.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
- The strategy is designed to exploit opportunities by maintaining cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to prevent being exploited or to secure resources before depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def exploitative_strategy(n, capacity, r):
    cooperate = True  # Initial state: Cooperate
    stock_history = []  # To track stock levels over rounds
    defector_counts = []  # To count number of defectors each round

    for t in range(1, r + 1):
        if t == r:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            action = 'C' if cooperate else 'D'

        # Play the action and get payoff
        pi_t = calculate_payoff(action, current_stock)
        total_payoff += pi_t

        # Observe others' actions based on their payoffs
        defectors_t = count_defectors(pi_t, n, current_stock)
        defector_counts.append(defectors_t)

        # Update stock after this round's actions and growth
        new_stock = update_stock(current_stock, action, defectors_t, capacity)
        stock_history.append(new_stock)
        current_stock = new_stock

        if t < r:
            # Determine whether to cooperate or defect next round
            avg_defectors = average(defector_counts[-3:])  # Moving average of last 3 rounds
            stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity

            if (avg_defectors > n/2) or (stock_ratio < 0.5):
                cooperate = False
            else:
                cooperate = True

    return total_payoff

def calculate_payoff(action, stock, n):
    if action == 'C':
        return stock / (2 * n)
    else:
        return stock / n

def count_defectors(pi_t, n, stock):
    # Determine number of defectors based on others' payoffs
    # Assuming we can observe all players' actions
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if pi_i == calculate_payoff('D', stock, n):
            count += 1
    return count

def update_stock(current_stock, action, defectors_t, capacity):
    total_consumption = (action == 'C' and 1 or 0) * (current_stock / (2 * len(players))) + \
                       defectors_t * (current_stock / len(players))
    
    S_remaining = current_stock - total_consumption
    growth = 2 * S_remaining * (1 - S_remaining / capacity)
    new_stock = min(S_remaining + growth, capacity)
    return new_stock
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins with cooperation to set a cooperative tone and observe others' behavior.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** After each round, the strategy evaluates both the stock level and the number of defectors. If either condition triggers (stock below 50% or more than half defecting), it switches to defecting.
- **Stock Recovery Check:** After switching to defection, if the stock recovers without further depletion, the strategy may revert to cooperation, allowing for sustained resource management.
- **Final Round Defection:** In the last round, the strategy defects to secure maximum immediate payoff, as there are no future rounds to consider.

This approach balances sustainability with self-interest, ensuring that the player maximizes their payoffs while adapting to the dynamics of the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_181 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round based on the stock level, we can implement a simple yet effective heuristic. The strategy is designed to balance between maximizing individual payoff and maintaining the stock for future rounds.

**Strategy:**

1. **Initial Round:** Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** 
   - If the stock level after the previous round was below 50% of its capacity, choose to Cooperate in the current round.
   - Otherwise, if the stock level is above or equal to 50%, choose to Defect.

This approach ensures that when the stock is low, all players work together to replenish it, and when it's sufficiently high, they can afford to extract more resources.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Round:** All players start by Cooperating.
2. **After Each Round:**
   - Check the stock level from the previous round.
   - If it was below 50% of the capacity, choose to Cooperate this round.
   - If it was 50% or above, choose to Defect this round.

This strategy is straightforward and doesn't require tracking other players' actions, only the stock level. It helps maintain the stock when necessary while allowing for higher extraction when possible.

**Final Answer:**
The optimal strategy is to cooperate if the previous stock level was below 50% of capacity; otherwise, defect. So, the final decision in each round after the first is determined by comparing the previous stock level to this threshold. 

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if previous stock was below 50%; else Defect}}$

description_EXPLOITATIVE_182 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to observe opponents' actions without immediately signaling exploitation.

2. **Stock Threshold and Opponent Behavior Tracking:**
   - Track the stock level relative to capacity. If the stock drops below 50% of capacity, switch to cooperation temporarily to allow recovery.
   - Monitor opponents' past actions using a moving average (e.g., last 3 rounds) to assess their tendency to defect or cooperate.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - If stock is above 50% and opponents are mostly cooperating (defection rate below 50%), exploit by defecting.
   - If stock is below 50% or opponents have a high defection rate recently, switch to cooperation to preserve the resource.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final few rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds), increase defection rate to maximize immediate payoffs since future sustainability becomes less relevant.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Continuously update assessments of stock levels and opponent behaviors each round to adapt strategy accordingly.

This approach balances exploitation with resource preservation, adapting dynamically based on both the game's state and opponents' actions, ensuring robustness against diverse strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_183 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on a balance between maximizing immediate payoffs and ensuring long-term sustainability of the stock. The strategy adapts based on recent collective actions and current stock levels, without relying on coordination or specific opponent behaviors.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and Defection Trends

#### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This initial move tests the waters by observing how others respond.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the average stock level over the last three rounds.
   - Determine the average defection rate (proportion of players who defected) over these same rounds.
   - If both the average stock is below 50% of capacity and the average defection rate exceeds 50%, Cooperate to encourage stock regrowth.
   - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs.
   - Otherwise, default to Cooperate.

#### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round**: Start with Cooperation to gauge others' strategies without immediate depletion.
- **Last Round**: If it's the final round and stock is sufficient, Defect to capture maximum payoff since future rounds don't matter. Adjust based on remaining stock sustainability if part of a tournament.
- **Low Stock Situations**: Prioritize Cooperate when stock is critically low to prevent depletion.

#### Exploitative Approach:
The strategy exploits others' behavior by defecting when the stock is high enough to sustain, while conserving resources when necessary. It learns from recent trends, adapting to whether players are mostly cooperating or defecting, thus optimizing for both immediate and future gains.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, round_num, history):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate average stock over last 3 rounds
    avg_stock = sum(history['stocks'][-3:]) / 3
    
    # Calculate average defection rate over last 3 rounds
    total_defects = sum(len([a for a in actions if a == 'D']) for actions in history['actions'][-3:])
    avg_defection_rate = total_defects / (3 * n)
    
    if avg_stock < 0.5 * capacity and avg_defection_rate > 0.5:
        return "C"
    elif current_stock >= 0.5 * capacity:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"

# Example usage within a game
history = {
    'stocks': [100, 75, 62.5],  # Previous stock levels
    'actions': [[['C', 'C', 'C', 'C'], ['D', 'D', 'C', 'C']],]  # Previous actions per round
}
current_stock = 62.5
round_num = 4

action = strategy(4, 5, 100, current_stock, round_num, history)
print(action)  # Output: "D" or "C" based on conditions
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: The first move is to Cooperate, allowing observation of other players' tendencies.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: In subsequent rounds, the strategy evaluates recent stock levels and defection rates. If both indicate a need for conservation, it Cooperates; otherwise, it Defects when the stock is sufficient.
- **Threshold-Based Logic**: Uses clear thresholds (50% stock level and 50% defection rate) to decide actions, ensuring robustness against varying opponent behaviors.

This strategy effectively balances exploitation with sustainability, aiming to maximize individual payoffs while maintaining resource viability for future rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_184 = '''
To address the problem effectively, an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed with the following structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy combines observation of opponents' past actions, stock level monitoring, and adaptive decision-making to maximize individual payoffs while considering future rounds.

### Detailed Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a baseline behavior and observe others' reactions without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Majority Behavior Check:**
     - Count the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     - If more than half defected, choose to Defect (D) in the current round to avoid being exploited and maximize immediate gain.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate (C) to maintain a healthy stock level for future rounds.
   - **Stock Level Check:**
     - Monitor the current stock after consumption. If it drops below 20% of capacity, switch to Defecting (D) to secure remaining resources before depletion.

3. **Final Rounds (Last 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** In the last stages, there's no incentive to preserve the stock for future rounds, so maximize immediate payoffs by defecting.

4. **Payoff Performance Check:**
   - After each round, compare your payoff with others.
     - If your average payoff is significantly lower than others (especially those who defected more), consider increasing the frequency of Defect actions to prevent being exploited and improve relative standing.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to avoid immediate depletion and observe others' strategies.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Always defect to maximize short-term gains as future stock replenishment is irrelevant.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to defecting when the stock is critically low to secure remaining resources promptly.

### Strategy Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, previous_actions, current_stock, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round_number > 0.9 * total_rounds:  # Last 10% of rounds
        return "D"
    
    defectors_last_round = count_defections(previous_actions)
    n_players = len(previous_actions)
    
    if defectors_last_round / n_players > 0.5:
        return "D"
    elif current_stock < 0.2 * capacity:
        return "D"
    else:
        # Check relative payoff performance
        my_payoff = calculate_my_payoff()
        average_payoff_others = calculate_average_payoff_others()
        if my_payoff < average_payoff_others:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

# Helper functions: count_defections, calculate_my_payoff, calculate_average_payoff_others
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy balances cooperation and defection by adapting to opponents' behaviors and stock dynamics. It starts cooperatively, adapts based on majority actions, secures resources when necessary, and ensures maximal payoffs in the endgame.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation and avoid excessive initial stock depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Strategy:**
   - **Previous Cooperation Check:** Calculate the percentage of players who cooperated in the last round.
     - If >50% defected, choose Defect (D).
     - If ≤50% defected, continue Cooperating (C).
   - **Stock Level Consideration:** Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If stock is below a threshold (e.g., 25%), defect regardless of others' actions to maximize immediate gain.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize payoff without future repercussions.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If stock falls below a critical point, defect to secure remaining resources.

4. **Adaptive Adjustments:**
   - Continuously assess trends in others' behavior and stock changes.
   - Lower defection thresholds if observing increasing defection or declining stock levels over time.

5. **Payoff Comparison:**
   - If personal payoffs are consistently lower than peers, switch to Defect (D) to avoid being exploited.

This strategy balances initial cooperation with adaptive responses to others' actions and stock dynamics, ensuring exploitative efficiency without reliance on others' goodwill.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_186 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to consider a balanced approach that maximizes immediate gains while preserving the resource for future rounds. The strategy should adapt based on stock levels, opponent behavior, and the number of remaining rounds.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Rounds):**
   - Begin by Cooperating (C) to observe how other players behave and to prevent immediate depletion of the stock. This initial phase allows gathering information about others' tendencies without signaling aggression early on.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels and Opponent Behavior:**
   - Track the stock level after each round. If the stock is decreasing rapidly, indicating that many players are Defecting (D), adjust strategy to Cooperate more in subsequent rounds to allow the stock to recover.
   - Conversely, if the stock remains high or increases, infer that others are Cooperating, and consider defecting to exploit their cooperation for higher payoffs.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Implement a retaliatory response if opponents' actions lead to significant stock depletion. If in previous rounds, total consumption was excessively high (indicative of widespread defection), increase the rate of Defection in the next round to punish and exploit their greed before the stock is further depleted.

4. **Sustainability Check:**
   - Continuously assess whether current actions are sustainable for future rounds. If the stock level falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to Cooperating to facilitate regrowth and ensure resource availability in subsequent rounds.
   - Adjust the sustainability threshold dynamically based on the number of remaining rounds, becoming more conservative as the game progresses.

5. **Adaptive Thresholds:**
   - Use adaptive thresholds to determine when to Cooperate or Defect. For example, if the stock is above 75% of capacity and there are several rounds left, defect more frequently. If the stock drops below 50%, increase cooperation to allow recovery.
   - The exact threshold can be a weighted function of the remaining rounds and observed opponent behavior.

6. **Final Rounds:**
   - In the last few rounds, adopt a more aggressive strategy by Defecting if the stock is still at a sustainable level. However, avoid actions that would deplete the stock entirely, ensuring some payoff even in the final round.

### Pseudocode Representation

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins with cooperation in the first few rounds to observe others' actions and prevent immediate resource depletion.
  
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Based on stock levels and past behavior, the strategy shifts between Cooperate and Defect. If the stock is low, it cooperates to replenish; if high, it defects to exploit.

- **Punishment and Exploitation:** When opponents are observed defecting frequently, the strategy retaliates by increasing defection rates to maximize payoffs before resources dwindle further.

- **Sustainability Focus:** The strategy ensures that actions remain sustainable for future rounds by cooperating when necessary, thus preventing irreversible depletion of the resource.

This adaptive approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against a variety of opponent strategies in the tournament setting.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, cooperate (C) to encourage a positive tone and maximize collective payoff from the start.

2. **Track Cooperation Rate**: Maintain an average of cooperation rates over previous rounds. If the majority (>50%) have cooperated historically, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect to protect your interests.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the stock level relative to capacity. If it drops below 20%, switch to cooperation to aid replenishment and ensure future sustainability.

4. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final round, assess the current stock. If it's sufficiently high, defect to maximize immediate payoff without jeopardizing future rounds (which no longer exist). If the stock is low, cooperate to preserve what's left for potential future interactions beyond the tournament.

5. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Adjust cooperation thresholds based on game parameters. For example, in larger groups, require a higher cooperation rate to maintain resource sustainability.

6. **Robustness Mechanism**: Include a fail-safe where if stock depletion is rapid despite your strategy, switch to defecting more frequently to secure remaining payoffs before exhaustion.

7. **Mixed Strategy Consideration**: Introduce randomness by occasionally deviating from the main strategy (e.g., cooperate when expecting others to defect) to keep actions unpredictable and mitigate exploitation risks.

**Summary**: This approach balances immediate gains with long-term resource management, adapting based on group behavior and stock levels to maximize overall payoff while maintaining resource sustainability.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Hysteresis**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to avoid immediate depletion and observe others' behavior.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     - If the current stock is above 75% of the capacity, defect (D) to maximize payoff without significant risk of depletion.
     - If the current stock is below 50% of the capacity, cooperate (C) to help replenish the stock for future rounds.
     - If the stock is between 50% and 75%, continue with the action taken in the previous round to avoid oscillation.
   - **Last Round**: Always defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The strategy starts conservatively, cooperates when stock is critically low, and defects when it's safe, ensuring a balance between exploitation and conservation.

3. **Exploitative Approach**:
   - The strategy adapts based on the current state (stock level) and history (previous actions' outcomes), aiming to exploit high stock levels while preserving the resource when necessary.

This approach ensures robustness against various opponent behaviors by dynamically adjusting based on observed conditions, maximizing payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability for future exploitation.

To determine the optimal action in each round of the game, we'll follow a structured approach that considers the remaining number of rounds, the current stock level, and the historical behavior of opponents. This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize the player's total payoff.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Last Round (t = r):** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.
2. **Low Stock Threshold:** If the current stock falls below a critical threshold (capacity divided by the number of players, n), defect to secure as much payoff as possible before others deplete the remaining stock.
3. **Remaining Rounds Check:** If more than half of the total rounds remain, cooperate to sustain the stock for future rounds. Otherwise, shift towards defection as the game progresses toward its end.
4. **Opponents' Defection Rate:** Monitor the historical rate of defections. If a significant portion of previous actions were defections (e.g., above 50%), switch to defecting to avoid being exploited.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Last Round:** Always choose to defect (D).
2. **Low Stock:** If the current stock is below capacity/n, choose to defect (D).
3. **Remaining Rounds:** If more than half of the total rounds remain and opponents have not defected excessively, cooperate (C). Otherwise, defect (D).
4. **Opponents' Behavior:** If historical defection rates are high, switch to defecting (D).

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def determine_action(t, r, stock, capacity, n, history_defections):
    if t == r:
        return 'Defect'
    
    remaining_rounds = r - t + 1
    stock_threshold = capacity / n
    
    if stock < stock_threshold:
        return 'Defect'
    
    defection_rate = history_defections / (t - 1) if t > 1 else 0.5
    
    if remaining_rounds <= r // 2 or defection_rate > 0.5:
        return 'Defect'
    else:
        return 'Cooperate'
```

### Explanation:

- **Last Round Defection:** Ensures maximum payoff in the final round without concern for future consequences.
- **Stock Threshold:** Protects against depleting the stock too early by defecting when it's critically low.
- **Remaining Rounds:** Balances cooperation and defection based on the game's progression, encouraging cooperation early on and shifting to defection as the end approaches.
- **Opponents' Behavior Adaptation:** Adjusts strategy based on others' actions, preventing being exploited while still cooperating when beneficial.

This approach is robust, adaptive, and exploitative, aiming to maximize the player's total payoff by considering both the game's state and opponents' strategies.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Decision:**
   - Cooperate (C): Start by cooperating to encourage a positive initial state and maintain a healthy stock level.

2. **Last Round Decision:**
   - Defect (D): In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds dependent on current stock levels.

3. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If the number of previous defections by other players is below a certain threshold (e.g., 30%), continue cooperating.
   - **Defection Trigger:** If more than 30% of previous actions were defections, switch to defecting to protect against stock depletion and maximize personal payoffs.
   - **Stock Level Check:** Monitor the current stock level. If it falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), cooperate to facilitate stock recovery.

4. **Stock State Consideration:**
   - If the stock is low, prioritize cooperation to allow regeneration, ensuring sustainable future payoffs.
   - If the stock is healthy and others are mostly cooperating, continue cooperating to maintain a stable environment.

5. **Adaptive Monitoring:**

To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've considered various factors including stock levels, opponents' past actions, and round-specific considerations. The resulting strategy balances exploitation with conservation, adapting to both the current state and historical behavior.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and observe others' reactions without immediate exploitation.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the average defection rate of other players over the last `k` rounds, where `k` is a small number (e.g., 3).
     - If the stock level is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate (C) to conserve resources and allow regrowth.
     - If the stock level is above 50% of capacity:
       - Defect (D) if more than half of the opponents defected on average in the last `k` rounds.
       - Otherwise, Cooperate (C).

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, exploiting cooperative behavior while conserving resources when necessary. It ensures that the player maximizes their payoff by considering both the current state of the stock and the recent actions of opponents.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_192 = '''
To address the problem of determining when to cooperate or defect in a repeated game with perfect information, we can design a strategy that balances maintaining future payoffs with exploiting current opportunities. The approach considers both the remaining rounds and the current stock level.

### Approach
The strategy is based on a threshold that decreases as the game progresses. This threshold determines whether to cooperate or defect:

1. **Initial Cooperation:** Cooperate in the first round to establish a high stock level.
2. **Threshold Calculation:** In each subsequent round, calculate a dynamic threshold based on the remaining rounds. The formula used is:
   \[
   T(t) = \text{capacity} \times \left(1 - \frac{t}{R}\right)
   \]
   where \( t \) is the current round number and \( R \) is the total number of rounds.
3. **Decision Making:** Cooperate if the current stock level (\( S \)) is above the threshold; otherwise, defect.
4. **Last Round Exception:** Always defect in the last round to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future repercussions.

### Solution Code
```python
def determine_action(t, R, S, capacity):
    """
    Determine whether to Cooperate or Defect based on current state.
    
    Parameters:
    t (int): Current round number (1-indexed).
    R (int): Total number of rounds.
    S (float): Current stock level.
    capacity (float): Maximum possible stock level.
    
    Returns:
    str: "Cooperate" or "Defect".
    """
    if t == R:
        return "Defect"
    
    remaining_rounds = R - t
    threshold = capacity * (remaining_rounds / R)
    
    if S > threshold:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"

# Example usage:
R_total = 10  # Total rounds
capacity_value = 100.0

current_round = 5
stock_level = 60.0
action = determine_action(current_round, R_total, stock_level, capacity_value)
print(f"In round {current_round}, action is: {action}")
```

### Explanation
- **Threshold Calculation:** The threshold decreases linearly from the full capacity to zero as the game progresses. This means that in early rounds, a higher stock level is required to cooperate, while in later rounds, even lower stock levels will lead to defection.
- **Last Round Handling:** In the final round, the strategy defects to maximize immediate gain since there are no future rounds to affect.
- **Stock Level Consideration:** By considering the current stock level against a dynamic threshold, the strategy balances maintaining a sustainable stock for future rounds with exploiting opportunities when the stock is sufficiently high.

This approach ensures that the strategy adapts both to the progression of the game and the state of the stock, aiming to maximize overall payoffs while being robust against changes in others' strategies.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to observe opponents' initial actions and their impact on the stock.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     - Calculate the number of defections (D_count) from the previous round.
     - Determine the average cooperation rate (1 - D_count / n).
     - Assess the current stock level relative to capacity.
       - If D_count is high (> 50%) and stock is low (< 30% of capacity), Cooperate to help replenish.
       - If D_count is low (< 30%) and stock is high (> 70% of capacity), Defect to exploit higher payoffs.
     - Adjust based on recent trends: if opponents are mostly defecting, consider defecting; if cooperating, balance with occasional defection.
   - **Last Round**: Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, considering the stock's ability to sustain a high consumption without severe depletion.

**2. Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round**: Start with cooperation to gather baseline data on opponents' tendencies.
   - **Low Stock Situations**: If stock is critically low, prioritize cooperation to prevent depletion and ensure future payoffs.
   - **Last Round Strategy**: Evaluate the balance between immediate gain and stock sustainability before deciding to defect.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
   - Continuously monitor opponents' actions and adapt strategy to exploit their patterns.
   - Use past behavior to predict future moves, adjusting cooperation or defection accordingly.
   - Maintain flexibility to switch strategies based on observed outcomes, ensuring maximum exploitation without jeopardizing future stock levels.

This strategy aims to dynamically adapt to the evolving game state and opponents' behaviors, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability through informed decision-making.

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that maximizes individual payoffs while considering the sustainability of the common resource. The strategy must adapt based on the actions of other players and the current state of the stock.

### Strategy Overview:
The proposed strategy is adaptive, starting with cooperation to observe others' behavior and then adjusting based on the number of cooperators and the stock level. The goal is to defect when it's beneficial while preserving the resource when possible.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Begin by cooperating to set a cooperative tone and observe how other players react without immediately exploiting.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Previous Cooperation:** Calculate the number of players who cooperated in the previous round (k_c).
   - **Threshold Check:**
     - If more than half of the players cooperated last round (k_c / n > 0.5) and the current stock is above a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), continue cooperating.
     - Otherwise, defect to secure higher payoffs.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** In the final round, with no future rounds to consider, maximizing immediate payoff takes precedence over resource preservation.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is significantly depleted, defect to maximize current payoffs.
- **High Cooperation:** Continue cooperating if a sufficient number of players are maintaining the resource sustainably.

This strategy balances between exploiting when others aren't cooperating enough and preserving the resource for future rounds. It's robust against various opponent behaviors without relying on coordination or communication.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_195 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we aim to balance cooperation with the necessity of maximizing one's own payoff, especially when others might be defecting. The strategy adapts based on the game's history and current stock levels.

### Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Stock Threshold

1. **First Round**:
   - Cooperate (C). This initial move sets a cooperative tone and observes others' responses.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Stock Check**: If the current stock is below 20% of capacity, evaluate the previous round's defections.
     - If more than half of the players defected in the last round, Defect (D) to avoid being exploited further.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate (C) to help rebuild the stock.
   - **Sufficient Stock**: When stock is above 20% capacity, base your action on the previous round's defections.
     - If more than half defected in the last round, Defect (D).
     - Otherwise, Cooperate (C).

3. **Last Round**:
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future consequences are irrelevant.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation encourages others to reciprocate and maintains a sustainable stock initially.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: By responding to the majority's previous actions, the strategy incentivizes cooperation when beneficial but switches to defection to avoid exploitation.
- **Stock Threshold**: Intervening when stock is critically low helps prevent depletion while considering others' behavior ensures rational decision-making.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Defecting in the last round captures maximum payoff without future repercussions.

This approach effectively balances reciprocity with self-interest, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_196 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for an AI aiming to maximize resource sustainability in a scenario where multiple agents can choose to Cooperate or Defect, we analyzed various approaches. The key considerations were:

1. **Sustainability Threshold**: Total consumption must not exceed half of the resource capacity (C/2) to maintain stock levels.
2. **Cooperation Dependence**: If all players cooperate, total consumption stays exactly at the sustainable level. Any defection leads to overconsumption and depletion.
3. **Nash Equilibrium Consideration**: In a non-cooperative environment, mutual defection is often the equilibrium, as individual rationality leads each player to defect if others might do so.

**Optimal Strategy**:
- The AI should Cooperate only if all other players cooperated in the previous round. If any player Defected, the AI should switch to Defecting in subsequent rounds until cooperation is universally restored.

This approach ensures that the AI doesn't allow others to take advantage of its cooperative behavior and maintains resource sustainability when possible.

**Final Answer**: The optimal strategy for the AI is to Cooperate if all other players cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, it should Defect. This approach is encapsulated as:

\boxed{\text{Cooperate only if everyone else cooperated last round; otherwise, Defect}}

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: If the stock drops below 25% of capacity, switch to defection to secure remaining resources.
   - **Reciprocity Based on Recent History**: Analyze opponents' actions over the last few rounds (e.g., last 3). Cooperate if most opponents cooperated; otherwise, defect.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round**: If it's the final round and stock is critically low, defect to ensure some payoff.
   - **High Stock Levels**: Continue cooperating when the stock is healthy to maintain sustainability.

### Explanation and Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages trust and maximizes initial payoffs, promoting a healthy stock level.
- **Stock Threshold**: Prevents over-exploitation by switching to defection when the stock is critically low, ensuring some payoff.
- **Reciprocity Mechanism**: Adapts based on recent opponent behavior, rewarding cooperation with cooperation and countering defection with defection.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: Tailors decisions for the first and last rounds, ensuring strategic play even in terminal conditions.

This strategy balances exploitative tendencies with cooperative sustainability, aiming to maximize long-term payoffs while adapting dynamically to game dynamics.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (until the last round):** 
   - If the stock after growth in the previous round is above 80% of the capacity, choose to Defect to take advantage of the high stock without causing severe depletion.
   - If the stock after growth is below or equal to 80%, Cooperate to help replenish and maintain the stock for future rounds.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, cooperation is chosen without prior history.
   - The last round prioritizes immediate gain, as there's no subsequent impact on stock levels.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to observe others' initial actions and establish a baseline of cooperation.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**

    - If more than half defected, defect in the current round to exploit their behavior.
    - If half or fewer defected, check the stock level relative to capacity:
      - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, cooperate to maintain sustainability.
      - If between 50-75%, alternate between cooperate and defect to balance exploitation and conservation.
      - Below 50%, switch strategies dynamically based on recent trends to avoid cycles.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to gauge others' tendencies.

To address the Common Pool Resource game, we've designed an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize payoffs while maintaining stock sustainability. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage initial stock conservation and foster cooperation among players.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Defection Threshold**: If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, or if the current stock is below a specified threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), defect.

### Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds**: 
  - If previous round had majority defectors or stock is below threshold → Defect.
  - Else → Cooperate.
- **Last Round**: Always Defect.

### Edge Cases and Considerations:
- **Stock Conservation**: When the stock is low, prioritize cooperation to allow growth unless others' defection necessitates a defensive approach.
- **Punishment Mechanism**: defecting when others have defected in numbers ensures not being exploited.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitative Approach (AEA)**

The AEA strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection dynamically based on the behavior of other players and the current state of the stock. It aims to maximize individual payoffs while promoting sustainable resource use.

### 1. Decision Rules:

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This initial move encourages potential cooperation from others and allows maximum stock growth.

- **Subsequent Rounds (Before Last):**
  - **Cooperation Threshold:** Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players over the last few rounds (e.g., previous 3 rounds). If this rate is above 50%, continue cooperating.
  - **Stock Level Check:** If the stock falls below half its capacity, switch to defecting to protect against further depletion.
  - **Punishment Mechanism:** If others' cooperation rate drops below a threshold, defect for a set number of rounds (e.g., 2-3) to deter exploitation. After this period, revert to evaluating cooperation rates.

- **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as there's no future stock to preserve.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

- **All Players Cooperate:** Maintain cooperation to sustain high stock levels and mutual benefits.
- **Some Defectors:** Implement the punishment phase by defecting temporarily to encourage others to cooperate again.
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock is near zero, defect as there's no benefit in conserving an already depleted resource.

### 3. Adaptation and Forgiveness:

- Use a moving average of cooperation rates from recent rounds (e.g., last 3) to assess others' behavior, allowing flexibility and reducing noise impact.
- After punishing, return to evaluating cooperation levels, potentially reverting to cooperation if others change their strategy.

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def AEA_strategy(game_state):
    # Initialization for each player's cooperation count
    cooperate_counts = {player: 0 for player in players}
    
    for round in range(1, r + 1):
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            # Calculate average cooperation rate of others
            avg_coop = sum(cooperate_counts.values()) / (n * (round - 1))
            
            # Check stock level
            if game_state['stock'] < capacity / 2:
                action = 'D'
            elif avg_coop > 0.5:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                # Punishment phase for a set number of rounds
                action = 'D'
        
        # Execute action and update cooperation counts based on others' previous actions
        # In last round, always defect
        if round == r:
            action = 'D'
    
    return action
```

### Summary:

The AEA strategy starts cooperatively to foster mutual benefit, adapts based on others' recent behavior and stock levels, punishes defection to deter exploitation, and defects in the final round for maximum gain. This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_203 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we propose an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observed outcomes and stock levels.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Threshold Cooperation (ATC)

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate to initiate with a conservative approach, preserving the resource for future rounds.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:** After each round, evaluate the stock level after regeneration:
  - If the stock is above two-thirds of the capacity, continue cooperating.
  - If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to defecting in the next round.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since future consequences are irrelevant.
  
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock drops to zero, persist with defection as regeneration isn't possible until the next round.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**

The strategy is designed to exploit the resource sustainably while being robust against various opponent behaviors. By starting with cooperation and adapting based on stock levels, it aims to prevent depletion and maximize long-term payoffs.

**Pseudocode Example:**
```
Initialize action = Cooperate
stock_history = [initial_stock]

For each round from 2 to r:
    previous_stock = stock_history[-1]
    current_action = decide_action(previous_stock)
    record payoff and update stock_history

def decide_action(stock):
    threshold = (2/3) * capacity
    if stock >= threshold:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        return Defect
```

This strategy encourages cooperation when the resource is abundant, ensuring sustainability, while defecting when necessary to protect against over-exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_204 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance between exploiting others' cooperation and conserving the stock for future rounds. It adapts based on the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players.

### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1 and 2):** Cooperate (C) to observe others' behavior without immediately exploiting.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (3 to r-1):**
   - If the current stock level is below 50% of the capacity, choose Cooperate (C) to help regenerate the stock.
   - If the majority of players defected in the previous round, switch to Defect (D) to avoid being exploited.
   - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).
3. **Last Round (Round r):** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def exploitative_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, history, current_round, total_rounds):
    if current_round <= 2:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        previous_actions = history[-n]  # Actions from the last round
        count_defections = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
        
        if current_stock < capacity / 2:
            return "C"
        elif count_defections > n / 2:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** The first two rounds are used to gather information on others' strategies, promoting sustainability early in the game.
- **Stock Conservation:** When the stock is depleted below half capacity, cooperation is favored to allow regeneration, ensuring future payoffs.
- **Majority Defection Response:** If more than half of the players defected previously, the strategy shifts to defecting to prevent being taken advantage of.
- **Last Round Exploitation:** In the final round, with no future consequences, the player defects to maximize immediate gain.

This adaptive approach aims to exploit others' strategies while maintaining stock health for sustained payoffs throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_205 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Decision:**
   - Cooperate (C). This initializes the game positively, encouraging potential cooperation from others without immediate depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Monitor the stock level after each round's growth.
     - If the new stock is greater than or equal to the previous stock, continue Cooperating (C).
     - If the new stock is less than the previous stock, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff as others may be defecting.

3. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - Always Defect (D). Since there are no future consequences, maximize your final round payoff.

4. **Low Stock Threshold:**
   - If the current stock falls below 25% of capacity, switch to Defecting (D) immediately to secure remaining resources.

This strategy is designed to adapt based on observed behavior and stock dynamics, balancing cooperation with strategic defection to exploit opportunities while safeguarding against resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_206 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and observe others' reactions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track the stock level after each round.
     - If the stock remains above 75% of capacity, continue Cooperating (C).
     - If the stock drops below 50%, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize short-term gains.

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Always Defect (D) in the final round to secure maximum immediate payoff without concern for future stock.

4. **Adaptive Monitoring:**
   - Continuously assess the stock's growth and depletion trends.
   - Adjust strategy if cooperation isn't maintaining a healthy stock level, indicating potential widespread defection by others.

This approach balances initial cooperation with strategic exploitation, ensuring sustainability while adapting to exploit when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_207 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll employ an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with exploitation based on observed trends in the stock level. The goal is to maximize individual payoff by sustaining resources when possible while exploiting them when others deplete them.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Trends

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation allows us to observe the behavior of other players without immediately depleting the stock.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - **Monitor Stock Levels**: Track the stock level after growth in each round. If the stock after growth falls below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to Defecting (D) in subsequent rounds.
  - **Trend Analysis**: Instead of looking at a single round, assess whether the stock is consistently decreasing over the last few rounds (e.g., 2-3 rounds). If there's a downward trend, switch to D.

- **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **Low Stock Levels**: If at any point the stock after growth drops below 20% of capacity, immediately switch to Defecting in the next round to exploit remaining resources.
  
- **Sustained High Stock**: Continue Cooperating as long as the stock remains above 50% of capacity and shows a stable or increasing trend.

#### 3. Exploitative Approach:
- The strategy is designed to cooperate only when it's beneficial and sustainable, switching to exploitation when others' actions lead to significant depletion. This ensures that we don't let others take advantage without repercussions while maximizing our payoffs in the short term when necessary.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(t, stock_history, capacity):
    if t == 0:
        return "C"
    
    # Check if this is the last round
    if t == r - 1:
        return "D"
    
    # Calculate threshold based on capacity (e.g., 50%)
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    # Get previous stock after growth
    prev_stock = stock_history[t-1]
    
    # Check if the previous stock is below threshold
    if prev_stock < threshold:
        return "D"
    
    # Optional: Trend analysis over last k rounds (e.g., k=2)
    # Calculate average of last k stocks or check for decreasing trend
    # If trend indicates depletion, return "D"
    
    # Otherwise, continue Cooperating
    return "C"

# Example usage:
action = decide_action(current_round, stock_history, capacity)
```

### Explanation:
- **First Round Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to gauge others' behavior without immediate depletion.
- **Stock Monitoring**: Watches for significant drops in stock levels, indicating potential exploitation by others, and adapts by defecting.
- **Last Round Exploitation**: Maximizes payoff in the final round without concern for future consequences.
- **Threshold-Based Adaptation**: Uses predefined thresholds to determine when to switch strategies, ensuring responsiveness to changes in resource availability.

This strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors, adapting to exploit when beneficial while attempting to sustain resources when cooperation is viable.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_208 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round of a game where the goal is to maximize payoffs while considering both immediate gains and future sustainability, we can employ an adaptive strategy. This strategy balances cooperation with the need to punish excessive defection to maintain resource levels. Here's the structured approach:

### Adaptive Strategy for Cooperation vs. Defection

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Reasoning:** Establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' initial behavior.

2. **Last Round (r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Reasoning:** In the final round, there’s no future benefit to preserving resources, so maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Initial State:** Start in a cooperating state.
   - **Decision Making:**
     - If currently cooperating:
       - Check if the stock level after the previous round is below 10% of capacity, or if more than half the players defected last round, or if the stock is below two-thirds of capacity. If any condition is met, switch to defecting.
       - Otherwise, continue cooperating.
     - If currently defecting:
       - Revert to cooperation only if both the stock level after the previous round exceeds two-thirds of capacity and fewer than half the players defected last round. Otherwise, continue defecting.

### Formalized Strategy in Pseudocode

```python
def decide_action(round_number, total_rounds, current_stock, previous_defectors):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock <= 0.1 * capacity:
            return 'D'
        else:
            if previous_defectors > n / 2 or current_stock < (2/3) * capacity:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
```

### Explanation

- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to encourage mutual benefit.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.
- **Middle Rounds:** 
  - If the stock is critically low (≤10% of capacity), defect to secure what's left.
  - If more than half defected last round or the stock is below two-thirds, switch to defecting to punish defectors and protect remaining resources.
  - Only revert to cooperation if both the stock recovers above two-thirds and fewer than half defected, ensuring sustainable conditions.

This strategy adaptively switches between cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and resource levels, aiming to balance self-interest with resource preservation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_209 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, I have developed a structured approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. This strategy is adaptive and robust, considering both the current state of the stock and the recent behavior of other players.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This initial move sets a baseline and allows observation of others' actions without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Defection Rates**: Track the number of players who Defected in each round. If more than 50% of players defected in the majority of the last three rounds, switch to Defecting (D) to exploit their behavior.
   - **Stock Level Check**: If the stock falls below 20% of capacity, Cooperate to help replenish it, ensuring future rounds have a sustainable resource base.

3. **Last Round**: Always Defect (D). Since there are no subsequent rounds, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff without concern for stock depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity):
    current_stock = capacity
    history_defects = []
    
    for round in 1 to r:
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else if round == r:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            recent_defect_rate = sum(history_defects[-3:]) / (3 * n)
            if current_stock < 0.2 * capacity:
                action = 'C'
            elif recent_defect_rate > 0.5:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'
        # Record the number of defectors in this round
        history_defects.append(count_of_defectors)
        # Update current_stock based on actions and game dynamics
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation allows the strategy to observe others' behavior without immediately harming the stock.
- **Adaptive Defection**: By monitoring recent defection rates, the strategy can exploit periods where many players are defecting, maximizing personal gain while others deplete the resource.
- **Stock Conservation**: When the stock is critically low, cooperating helps maintain future resources, ensuring sustained payoffs over all rounds.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Defecting in the last round maximizes immediate payoff since there's no future impact to consider.

This strategy effectively balances exploitation with conservation, adapting dynamically based on both environmental and social factors within the game.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial collective gains.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - **Monitor Defection Rate:** Track the number of players who defected in the previous round.
    - If ≥50% defected, choose to Defect (D).
    - If <50%, Cooperate (C).
  - **Stock Level Adjustment:**
    - If current stock is below a threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), defect to ensure resource availability for future rounds.

**2. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **Last Round:** Assess the stock level:
  - If stock is sufficient, Cooperate to maintain balance.
  - If stock is low, Defect to maximize immediate gain, as there are no subsequent rounds to penalize this action.

**3. Forgiveness Mechanism:**
- Implement a Tit-for-Tat strategy with occasional forgiveness (e.g., every third round) to encourage cooperation from previous defectors.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
Initialize:
    cooperate = True
    stock_threshold = 0.2 * capacity

For each round from 1 to r:
    if first round:
        action = C
    else:
        previous_defections = count of D actions last round
        defection_ratio = previous_defections / n
        
        if defection_ratio > 0.5 or stock < stock_threshold:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C
            
        # Forgiveness mechanism
        with probability δ (e.g., 0.2), switch action to encourage cooperation

    record action and update history

After all rounds:
    analyze outcomes to adjust strategy for future interactions if necessary
```

**Rationale:**
This strategy balances punishment for defection with incentives for cooperation, adapting dynamically based on observed behavior and resource sustainability. It ensures robustness against a variety of opponent strategies while promoting resource conservation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_211 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize payoffs while maintaining stock sustainability. The strategy will be exploitative, reacting to opponents' behaviors and the game's state.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - Cooperate in the first round. This sets a baseline of cooperation and allows observation of other players' initial actions without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Monitor Opponents' Behavior**:
   - Track the number of players who defected in each previous round.
   - Calculate the average payoff per player in each round to gauge overall exploitation levels.

3. **Trigger for Defection**:
   - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, switch to defecting in the next round. This prevents being exploited by widespread defection.
   - Additionally, if the stock drops below 50% of capacity, begin defecting to immediately maximize payoffs while the stock is still sufficient.

4. **Rebuild Trust**:
   - If after switching to defection, observe that a significant number of players return to cooperation (e.g., fewer than half defect), revert to cooperating. This allows the stock to recover and resets the cooperative environment.

5. **Last Round Defection**:
   - In the final round, always choose to defect. Since there's no future impact, maximizing immediate payoff is optimal without concern for stock regeneration.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, current_stock, history, round_num, total_rounds):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"  # Initial cooperation
    
    # Determine number of defectors in the previous round
    prev_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'D')
    
    # Check if stock is below threshold
    stock_threshold = capacity * 0.5
    if current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return "D"
    
    # Evaluate opponents' behavior
    if prev_defectors > n / 2:
        return "D"  # Defect if majority defected last round
    
    # Check for sustained cooperation to revert
    recent_coops = sum(1 for actions in history[-3:] for action in actions if action == 'C')
    if recent_coops >= (n * 0.7) and current_stock > stock_threshold:
        return "C"  # Revert to cooperation
    
    # Last round decision
    if round_num == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    
    # Default to cooperation if no triggers met
    return "C"
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to establish a baseline and observe others.
- **Defection Triggers**: Switches to defection when there's significant exploitation (majority defecting or low stock) to prevent being taken advantage of.
- **Rebuild Trust**: Reverts to cooperation if opponents return to cooperative behavior, fostering a sustainable environment.
- **Last Round Exploitation**: Maximizes payoff in the final round without concern for future consequences.

This strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors, adaptively responding to maintain high payoffs while preserving stock levels for sustained play.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Action:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to set a cooperative tone and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Strategy:**
   - Utilize a reciprocal approach similar to Tit-for-Tat:
     - Track the number of players who cooperated (C) or defected (D) in the previous round.
     - Cooperate in the current round if more than half of the players cooperated previously.
     - Defect if fewer than half cooperated, thereby retaliating against defection.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - Monitor the stock level after each round.
   - If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to cooperating to help replenish the stock, regardless of others' past actions.

4. **Final Round Decision:**
   - In the last round, defect unless the stock is critically low. If the stock is low, cooperate to maximize immediate payoff without depleting the resource excessively.

This strategy balances between exploiting current opportunities and preserving the resource for future rounds, adapting based on both historical actions and the current state of the stock.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_213 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Early Rounds:** Cooperate (C) initially to promote a sustainable stock level, encouraging others to do the same.
   - **Stock Monitoring:** Continuously assess the current stock level and its trend over previous rounds. If the stock shows significant depletion (e.g., drops below 50% of capacity), switch to Defect (D) to prevent being exploited by others' excessive consumption.
   - **Reciprocity Mechanism:** Track the number of players defecting in recent rounds. If a majority or significant portion defected, retaliate by switching to D to avoid being taken advantage of.
   - **Final Round Adaptation:** In the last round (t = r), always choose Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future stock to preserve.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and observe others' initial actions.
   - **Last Round:** Switch to Defect (D) regardless of previous actions to secure the highest possible immediate payoff.
   - **Critical Stock Levels:** Implement thresholds where if the stock falls below a certain level (e.g., 30% of capacity), automatically switch to D to prevent further depletion and secure remaining resources.

3. **Exploitative Mindset:**
   - Focus on maximizing personal payoffs by responding strategically to others' actions and the game's state.
   - Balance between maintaining cooperation for sustainability and defecting when necessary to avoid exploitation, ensuring robustness against diverse strategies.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def exploitative_strategy(game_params, current_state, history):
    n = game_params['n']
    r = game_params['r']
    capacity = game_params['capacity']
    stock = current_state['stock']
    round = current_state['round']
    
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate average cooperation rate from history
        avg_coop_rate = calculate_avg_coop(history)
        # Determine stock depletion trend
        stock_trend = analyze_stock_trend(history)
        
        if stock < 0.3 * capacity or stock_trend == 'decreasing':
            return 'D'
        elif avg_coop_rate >= 0.7:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

def calculate_avg_coop(history):
    # Calculate average cooperation rate of other players
    pass

def analyze_stock_trend(history):
    # Determine if stock is decreasing over time
    pass
```

This strategy adaptively switches between cooperation and defection based on observable game states and historical actions, ensuring a balance between sustainability and exploitation to maximize total payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_214 = '''
To address the challenge posed by the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed a strategic approach that balances cooperation with exploitation, ensuring long-term resource sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Protection

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C) to initiate mutual cooperation and observe others' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate of all players in the previous round.
     - If ≥70% cooperated, continue cooperating.
     - If <70%, switch to defecting.
   - Monitor the stock level:
     - If stock is below half capacity, cooperate to facilitate recovery.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future consequences.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to encourage mutual benefit and observe others' strategies.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Adjusts behavior based on previous actions, promoting continued cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary to avoid exploitation.
- **Stock Protection:** Ensures the resource remains viable by cooperating when stock levels are critical, preventing depletion that could harm future payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_strategy(game_state, player_id):
    if game_state['round'] == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        previous_actions = game_state['previous_actions']
        avg_coop_rate = sum(1 for a in previous_actions if a == 'C') / len(previous_actions)
        
        if avg_coop_rate >= 0.7 and game_state['stock'] > (game_state['capacity'] / 2):
            return 'C'
        elif avg_coop_rate < 0.7 or game_state['stock'] <= (game_state['capacity'] / 2):
            return 'D'
    
    if game_state['round'] == game_state['total_rounds']:
        return 'D'

# Example usage:
current_round = game_state['round']
if current_round == 1:
    action = 'C'
else:
    avg_coop_rate = calculate_average_cooperation()
    stock_level = game_state['stock']
    capacity = game_state['capacity']
    
    if avg_coop_rate >= 0.7 and stock_level > (capacity / 2):
        action = 'C'
    elif avg_coop_rate < 0.7 or stock_level <= (capacity / 2):
        action = 'D'
    
if current_round == game_state['total_rounds']:
    action = 'D'

print(f"Player {player_id}'s action in round {current_round}: {action}")
```

### Conclusion:

This strategy aims to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to the collective behavior of players and protecting the resource's stock level. It encourages cooperation when beneficial while strategically defecting to maximize payoffs, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_215 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we've developed a structured approach that balances cooperation with defection based on the current state and position within the game. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining the sustainability of the common pool.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation

**1. First Round: Cooperate**
   - **Action:** Choose C (Cooperate)
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation helps establish a pattern that may encourage others to cooperate initially, preserving the stock for future rounds and allowing observation of other players' behaviors.

**2. Rounds 2 to r-1: Threshold-Based Decision**
   - **Threshold:** Set at half of the maximum capacity (0.5 * K).
     - **If current stock > threshold:** Choose D (Defect) to exploit the resource for higher immediate payoff.
     - **Else:** Choose C (Cooperate) to help replenish the stock and prevent depletion.
   - **Rationale:** This adaptive approach ensures that while you take advantage of a healthy stock level, you also contribute to its sustainability when it's low, thus balancing short-term gains with long-term resource availability.

**3. Last Round: Always Defect**
   - **Action:** Choose D (Defect)
   - **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for depleting the stock, so defecting maximizes your immediate payoff without concern for sustainability.

### Summary of Strategy

- **First Round:** Cooperate to initiate a cooperative environment.
- **Intermediate Rounds:** Defect if the stock is above half capacity; otherwise, cooperate to sustain the resource.
- **Final Round:** Always defect to maximize payoff.

This strategy is robust as it dynamically responds to the state of the common pool while strategically exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs when possible.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_216 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round based on the actions of other players and the resulting stock levels, we can employ an adaptive strategy. This approach ensures that we maintain cooperation unless others start to defect, at which point we switch to defecting to maximize our own payoff.

### Strategy:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate to encourage others to do the same and maintain a high stock level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the total consumption from the previous round based on players' choices (C or D).
   - Compute the excess consumption by comparing actual total consumption to the expected consumption if everyone had cooperated (S_prev/2).
   - If there was any excess consumption (>0), switch to Defecting in the current round. Otherwise, continue Cooperating.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Initialize**: In the first round, choose to Cooperate.
2. **Iterate** for each subsequent round:
   - Sum up the total consumption from all players' actions in the previous round.
   - Determine if there was excess consumption by subtracting half of the previous stock level (expected cooperative consumption) from the actual total consumption.
   - If excess consumption is positive, choose to Defect in the current round. Otherwise, continue Cooperating.

### Example Walkthrough:
- **Round 1**: All players Cooperate. Total consumption = 50. Stock remains at 100.
- **Round 2**: One player Defects. Their consumption =25, others Cooperate (total=37.5). Actual total consumption=62.5. Excess consumption=12.5>0.
- **Round 3**: All players see the excess and switch to Defecting. Total consumption=84.375, leading to stock depletion.

### Conclusion:
This strategy ensures cooperation is maintained as long as others adhere to it but adaptively switches to defecting upon detecting any over-consumption, thereby protecting our own payoff in competitive scenarios.

To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll employ a dynamic approach that balances cooperation and defection based on the game's state and history. The goal is to maximize individual payoff while ensuring sustainable resource use.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and History

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by conserving the stock to allow initial growth, maximizing future payoffs.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Stock Level:** Check if the current stock is below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
     - **If Below Threshold:**
       - **Action:** Cooperate (C) to help replenish the stock.
     - **If Above Threshold:**
       - **Assess Others' Behavior:** Calculate the average number of Defectors in previous rounds.
         - **If Many Defectors (>50%):** Switch to Defect (D) to avoid being exploited.
         - **If Few Defectors (<50%):** Continue Cooperating (C) to maintain a healthy stock.
   - **Adaptation:** Adjust your strategy each round based on the stock level and others' actions.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff since there's no future stock to preserve.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round, history):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round == r:
        return "D"
    else:
        threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        if current_stock < threshold:
            return "C"
        else:
            prev_defectors = sum(h["defectors"] for h in history) / (round - 1)
            if prev_defectors > 0.5:
                return "D"
            else:
                return "C"
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a foundation for stock growth, ensuring higher payoffs in subsequent rounds.
- **Stock Level Monitoring:** By keeping track of the stock, we can determine when conservation is necessary to prevent depletion.
- **Adaptive Behavior:** Responding to others' actions prevents being exploited by frequent defectors while maintaining cooperation when beneficial.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** Defecting in the last round maximizes immediate gain without concern for future consequences.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to both environmental and competitive factors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_218 = '''
To address the challenge of balancing cooperation and exploitation in a common resource game, we've developed an adaptive strategy that responds to changes in the stock level. This approach ensures that while we aim to maximize our payoff, we also maintain the sustainability of the resource for future rounds.

### Strategy Summary:

1. **First Round: Cooperate**  
   - Begin by cooperating to establish a high initial stock level and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**  
   - **Monitor Stock Trend**: Compare the current stock level (S_current) with the previous round's stock level after growth (S_prev).  
     - If S_current is higher than or equal to S_prev, continue cooperating.  
     - If S_current is lower than S_prev, switch to defecting in the next round.
   - **Adjust Based on Stock Level**: If the stock drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), cooperate for one or two rounds to help recover before considering defecting again.

3. **Last Round: Always Defect**  
   - In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future resource depletion.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a high initial stock level and encourages others to follow suit.
- **Adaptive Response**: By monitoring whether the stock is increasing or decreasing, we can adjust our strategy to either exploit when others are cooperating or conserve when overexploitation occurs.
- **Stock Recovery Mechanism**: If the stock drops significantly, temporary cooperation helps replenish it, ensuring sustainability for future exploitation.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Defecting in the last round maximizes immediate gain since there's no future impact on the resource.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors in a competitive setting.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_219 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C). This encourages initial stock sustainability and higher future payoffs.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Monitor previous actions and current stock level.
   - If the stock is above 50% of capacity and most players cooperated previously, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock drops below 50% or many defected before, switch to defecting (D) to maximize immediate gains.

3. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Maintain cooperation if stock is high (above 75%) to sustain regrowth.
   - Adjust strategy based on observed actions and stock levels, adapting thresholds as needed.

4. **Response Mechanism:**
   - React to opponents' past actions; defect if others have defected frequently to avoid exploitation.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final round (round r), always defect to maximize immediate payoff without future repercussions.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, adapting based on game state and opponent behavior to exploitatively maximize payoffs while maintaining robustness across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_220 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a dynamic approach that adapts to both the actions of other players and the current state of the stock. This strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Starting with cooperation establishes a baseline of behavior and allows observation of others' initial actions without immediately exploiting the resource.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Previous Round's Actions:**
     - Count the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     - If more than half defected, switch strategy to defecting in the current round to avoid being exploited.

   - **Stock Level Consideration:**
     - If the stock is above a threshold (e.g., two-thirds of capacity), defect to exploit the resource while it's abundant.
     - If the stock is below this threshold, cooperate to help replenish the stock for future rounds.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Since there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for, prioritize immediate payoff maximization.

### Detailed Decision Rules:

- **Cooperation (C):** 
  - If in the first round.
  - If the stock is below two-thirds of capacity and fewer than half of the players defected last round.
  
- **Defection (D):**
  - If more than half defected last round, regardless of stock level.
  - If the stock is above two-thirds of capacity, regardless of previous defection rates.
  - Always defect in the last round.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops critically low (e.g., below one-third of capacity), consider switching to cooperation temporarily to allow recovery, even if others are defecting, to ensure some future payoffs.

- **All Players Cooperate:** If all players consistently cooperate, maintain cooperation to sustain high stock levels and maximize collective payoffs.

### Rationale:

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and exploitative by responding to both the stock's health and opponents' actions. It starts cooperatively to gauge others' strategies, then adapts by defecting when exploitation is beneficial or necessary. By considering stock thresholds, it balances immediate gains with future resource availability, ensuring a robust approach against diverse player behaviors.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    prev_defections = count_defections(history[-1])
    stock = get_current_stock()
    
    if current_round == r:
        return "D"
    
    if prev_defections > n/2:
        return "D"
    
    if stock > (2/3)*capacity:
        return "D"
    else:
        if stock < (1/3)*capacity and prev_defections <= n/2:
            return "C"
        else:
            # Consider temporary cooperation for recovery
            if stock < (1/3)*capacity:
                return "C"
            else:
                return "D"

# Helper functions: count_defections, get_current_stock
```

This strategy is designed to be robust and adaptive, aiming to maximize individual payoffs while considering the dynamic state of the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_221 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to cooperate or defect in order to maximize payoffs while considering future rounds and stock levels, I propose a strategy that balances exploitation and conservation. The key points are:

1. **Exploit When Safe**: Defect when the current stock is above 50% of its capacity. This allows taking advantage of plentiful resources without causing severe depletion.
2. **Conserve When Necessary**: Cooperate if the stock drops below 50% to help replenish it for future rounds.

This strategy ensures that we maximize immediate gains while preserving the resource for continued exploitation in subsequent rounds.

**Answer:**  
The optimal strategy is to defect when the current stock exceeds 50% of its capacity and cooperate otherwise. Thus, the final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Defect if } S > \frac{\text{capacity}}{2} \text{; otherwise, Cooperate}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_222 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game scenario where players can affect each other's payoffs through their choices, we need a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a structured approach based on the thought process:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Endgame Defection

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Begin by cooperating to establish a pattern of cooperation and observe how the stock level evolves. This helps in assessing whether others are also cooperating or defecting.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Threshold Check:** Monitor the current stock level (S_t). If S_t falls below 50% of the capacity, switch to defecting.
   - **Rationale:** If the stock is significantly depleted, it indicates that other players may be defecting frequently. Defecting at this point can maximize immediate gains since the stock cannot sustain much more cooperation without severe depletion.

3. **Endgame Rounds (Last 30% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Always defect.
   - **Rationale:** In the final stages, prioritize immediate payoffs as there are fewer future rounds to be affected by current actions. This ensures capturing maximum value when it matters most without concern for sustaining the stock beyond the game's conclusion.

### Summary

- **Early Game:** Cooperate to build a stable environment.
- **Mid Game:** Switch to defecting if the stock level drops below 50% capacity, indicating potential widespread defection by others.
- **End Game:** Defect consistently in the last 30% of rounds to maximize immediate payoffs.

This strategy adaptively responds to both the current state of the stock and the stage of the game, balancing cooperation for sustainability with strategic defection to capture value when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_223 = '''
To address the problem of determining the optimal strategy for each round in a competitive environment where players can choose to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D), we need a balanced approach that considers both maintaining resources for future rounds and exploiting opportunities when others defect. The proposed strategy is designed to be adaptive, ensuring maximum payoff while considering the state of the resource (stock level) and the behavior of other players.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
2. **Intermediate Rounds:** 
   - If the stock is below 50% capacity, Cooperate to replenish it.
   - Otherwise, assess the average number of Defectors among other players in previous rounds. If more than half have defected on average, Defect; otherwise, Cooperate.
3. **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future resource depletion.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **First Round:**
   - Action: Cooperate (C)
   - Reasoning: Starting with cooperation sets a high initial stock level and encourages others to cooperate, potentially leading to higher payoffs in subsequent rounds.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - If the current stock level is below 50% of its maximum capacity:
     - Action: Cooperate (C)
     - Reasoning: Prioritize replenishing the stock to ensure future rounds have resources available.
   - Else:
     - Calculate the average number of Defectors among other players in previous rounds. This can be done by summing all instances of D from other players and dividing by the total number of player-rounds (excluding yourself).
     - If the average exceeds 50%:
       - Action: Defect (D)
       - Reasoning: When a majority have been defecting, it's strategic to defect as well to maximize current payoff before stock depletion accelerates.
     - Else:
       - Action: Cooperate (C)
       - Reasoning: Maintain cooperation when others are not predominantly defecting to sustain higher stock levels for future rounds.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Action: Defect (D)
   - Reasoning: Since there are no subsequent rounds, prioritize maximizing the immediate payoff without concern for depleting resources further.

### Rationale:
- The strategy begins cooperatively to establish a strong resource base.
- It adaptively switches to cooperation when resources are low, ensuring sustainability.
- By defecting when others frequently do so, it avoids being exploited and maximizes current gains.
- In the final round, it ensures maximum extraction without future repercussions.

This approach balances between maintaining resource health for future rounds and strategically exploiting situations where others' defection can be capitalized upon.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_224 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create a balanced approach that adapts to both the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players. The strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while considering the sustainability of the common resource.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and History

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Initial Round**: Cooperate (C). This starts with a conservative approach to build a sustainable stock for future rounds.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     - **Stock Level Check**: If the current stock is below 25% of capacity, defect (D) to maximize immediate gain, as the stock may not recover otherwise.
     - **Historical Behavior Analysis**: If the majority of other players' past actions were defection, choose to defect (D) to avoid being exploited.
     - **Cooperate (C)**: If the stock is above 25% and most players have cooperated historically, continue cooperating to sustain the stock.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a sustainable foundation.
   - **Last Round**: Defect to exploit the maximum possible payoff without future consequences.
   - **Low Stock Scenario**: When the stock is critically low (below 25% of capacity), defect to capture remaining resources before depletion.

3. **Exploitative Approach**:
   - Continuously monitor both the stock level and opponents' past actions. Adjust behavior to exploit situations where others are primarily defecting, thus avoiding the role of the sucker who cooperates while others benefit more.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    
    stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    
    if current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return "D"
    
    # Analyze historical actions
    defect_count = sum(1 for action in history[-n:] if action == 'D')
    
    if defect_count / n > 0.5:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a sustainable tone, ensuring the stock remains healthy for future exploitation.
- **Stock Threshold**: Defecting when the stock is below 25% capacity ensures capturing value before potential depletion.
- **Adaptive Behavior Based on History**: By defecting when most others have defected historically, the strategy avoids being exploited and maximizes individual gain.
- **Last Round Exploitation**: In the final round, defecting ensures maximum immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to both environmental and competitive factors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C). This sets a baseline of cooperation and allows observation of other players' behaviors.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - Calculate the average stock over the past three rounds.
     - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, continue Cooperating to sustain long-term gains.
     - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to Defecting (D) in the next round to exploit before depletion.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If stock falls below 25% of capacity, continue defecting to capture as much value as possible before the resource is exhausted.

3. **Adaptive and Robust Approach:**
   - Continuously monitor stock levels and adjust strategy based on trends. If cooperation leads to stock recovery, revert to Cooperate; if not, maintain Defect to exploit others' actions without depleting the stock unnecessarily.

This strategy effectively balances between preserving the resource for future exploitation and strategically defecting when beneficial, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy designed is adaptive and exploitative, aiming to maximize individual payoffs by responding to both the stock level and opponents' behaviors. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Initial Rounds**: 
   - Begin with moderate defection (e.g., defect 50% of the time) to observe others' tendencies without significant depletion.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation**:
   - Track the average defection rate of other players each round.
     - If the average defection is high, shift towards cooperation to conserve stock.
     - If the average defection is low, increase defection to exploit the situation.
   - Adjust based on the previous round's outcomes to mirror or counter opponents' strategies.

3. **Stock Level Thresholds**:
   - Define a critical stock threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity). If the stock falls below this level, switch to full cooperation to allow regrowth.
   - Maintain cooperation until the stock recovers above the threshold, then resume adaptive play.

4. **Exploitative Moves**:
   - When the stock is plentiful (above a higher threshold, e.g., 70% of capacity), defect more aggressively to maximize immediate gains.
   - Use partial defection when the stock is moderate to balance exploitation and conservation.

5. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - In the final round, defect fully to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

This strategy combines responsiveness with a focus on maximizing individual gain, adapting to both environmental factors and opponents' actions. It ensures sustainability while exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs when possible.

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and allow the stock to regenerate.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - **Historical Defection Rate:** Calculate the average defection rate of other players over the past rounds, weighting recent actions more heavily.
     - If the average defection rate exceeds 50%, switch to defecting in the next round.
     - If the average is below 50%, continue cooperating but occasionally defect (e.g., every third round) if the stock level allows without significant depletion.
   - **Current Stock Level:** Monitor the stock after each round. If it drops below a threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), switch to cooperation temporarily to facilitate regeneration.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Always defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff, as future stock sustainability is no longer a concern.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is near depletion (e.g., below 10% of capacity), cooperate to allow regeneration for subsequent rounds, ensuring some resource availability.

4. **Weighted Historical Analysis:**
   - Use an exponentially weighted moving average to give more significance to recent actions, enabling quicker adaptation to changing strategies of other players.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

        if stock < 0.3 * capacity:
            return "C"
        elif current_round == total_rounds:
            return "D"
        else:
            if avg_defection > 0.5:
                return "D"
            else:
                # Cooperate but occasionally defect

capacity = 100
round = 5

action = adaptive_strategy(n_players, capacity, current_stock, history, round, total_rounds)

This strategy balances cooperation and defection by considering historical behavior, stock levels, and critical rounds to maximize payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_228 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Threshold**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Round 1:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation.
   - **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
     - Calculate the total number of defections (sum_D) across all players in previous rounds.
     - Compute the average defection rate as sum_D / (n*(t-1)), where t is the current round.
     - If the average defection rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%) **OR** if the stock level drops below 50% of capacity, defect (D).
     - Otherwise, cooperate (C).
   - **Last Few Rounds (e.g., last 10% of r):** Always defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Start with cooperation to build a high stock level for future rounds.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, switch to defection to prevent further depletion and secure remaining resources.
   - **Endgame:** In the final rounds, prioritize short-term gains by defecting, as there are fewer future consequences.

3. **Thresholds:**
   - **Defection Rate Threshold:** 30%. If more than this percentage of actions are defections, switch to defection.
   - **Stock Level Threshold:** 50% of capacity. Below this level, defect regardless of others' actions.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to adapt based on the game's state and past actions, balancing between sustaining resources and maximizing immediate gains. It uses a threshold approach to decide actions, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C) to initiate with resource conservation.
2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - Calculate the cooperation threshold as half of the capacity (0.5 * capacity).
   - If the stock after the previous round is above this threshold, Cooperate (C).
   - Otherwise, Defect (D) to secure resources before depletion.
3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Rationale:
- **First Round Cooperation**: Establishes a baseline of resource sustainability, encouraging others to follow suit and maintaining higher stocks initially.
- **Adaptive Threshold**: By using half the capacity as a threshold, the strategy promotes conservation when resources are ample and switches to exploitation when they dwindle, preventing being exploited by persistent defectors.
- **Last Round Exploitation**: In the final round, with no future impact, defecting ensures maximum immediate gain, optimizing personal payoff.

This approach efficiently balances sustainability and exploitation, ensuring adaptability across various scenarios.

The strategy should adapt based on both the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Sustainability

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to observe others' actions and maintain a high initial stock level, promoting sustainability from the start.

2. **Monitor Historical Actions and Stock Levels:**
   - Track the total number of defections across all players in previous rounds.
   - Continuously monitor the current stock level relative to the capacity.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - **Stock Health Check:** If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to cooperation to allow replenishment and prevent depletion.
   - **Defection Threshold:** Calculate the average defection rate from previous rounds. If this rate exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 50%), increase your own defection rate to exploit others' greed while the stock is sufficiently high.

4. **Balancing Exploitation and Sustainability:**
   - Prioritize stock health by cooperating when necessary, ensuring long-term payoffs.
   - Exploit situations where others are defecting without jeopardizing the stock's sustainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy():
    # Initialize variables
    total_defections = 0
    round = 1
    while round <= r:
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            avg_defection_rate = total_defections / (n * (round - 1))
            stock_threshold = capacity / 2
            if current_stock < stock_threshold:
                action = 'C'
            elif avg_defection_rate > 0.5:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'
        # Execute action and update totals
        total_defections += number_of_defectors_this_round
        round += 1

# Note: The strategy would need to track the number of defectors each round and the current stock level.
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, we set a cooperative tone and preserve the stock for future rounds.
- **Stock Health Check:** Ensuring the stock doesn't drop below a critical point prevents irreversible depletion and maintains future earning potential.
- **Exploitation Threshold:** When a significant portion of players are defecting, the strategy shifts to exploit this behavior, capturing higher payoffs while the stock can sustain it.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent strategies in a competitive environment.

To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll outline a structured approach based on the thought process above. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs by adaptively responding to the game's state and history.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Dynamics

**1. Initial Decision (First Round):**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C)
- **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation allows observation of others' behavior without immediate depletion, setting a baseline for stock dynamics.

**2. Subsequent Rounds:**
- **Monitor Stock Trends:** Track the change in stock levels after each round.
  - If the stock decreases by more than 10% from the previous round, it indicates significant depletion likely due to excessive defection by other players.
    - **Action:** Defect (D) in the next round to exploit remaining resources before further depletion.
  - If the stock remains stable or increases, it suggests a sustainable level of cooperation among players.
    - **Action:** Continue Cooperating (C) to maintain sustainability and consistent payoffs.

**3. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **Last Round (r):** Always Defect (D). With no future rounds, prioritizing immediate payoff is optimal as there's no need to preserve the stock.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below 20% of capacity, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains before potential depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity):
    current_stock = capacity
    for round in range(r):
        if round == 0:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            stock_change = (current_stock - previous_stock) / previous_stock * 100
            if stock_change < -10:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'
        
        if round == r-1:
            action = 'D'
        
        # Execute action and update state
        # ... code to simulate consumption, update stock, etc.
        
        previous_stock = current_stock
    return total_payoff

# Example usage:
payoff = adaptive_exploitation(n=4, r=10, capacity=100)
```

### Strategy Explanation

- **Adaptation:** The strategy adapts based on observed stock changes. A significant drop triggers a switch to defecting, while stability maintains cooperation.
- **Exploitation:** By defecting when others are perceived to be over-consuming, the strategy maximizes immediate gains without sacrificing long-term sustainability unnecessarily.
- **Edge Handling:** Special cases like the last round and low stock levels ensure optimal decision-making in critical situations.

This approach balances cooperation and defection dynamically, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_232 = '''
To address the challenge of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game where the goal is to maximize individual payoffs while considering the sustainability of a shared resource (represented by the stock level), we can implement a strategy that reacts to the current state of the stock. The strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term resource preservation.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round. This sets an initial condition where the stock is maximized, allowing for potential future growth if others also cooperate.

2. **Responsive Adaptation**: In subsequent rounds, monitor whether the stock level has decreased from the previous round. If it has decreased, this indicates that total consumption exceeded the sustainable threshold (i.e., overexploitation occurred), prompting a switch to defecting in the current round. Conversely, if the stock level is maintained or increased, continue cooperating.

This approach reacts to the collective behavior of all players, adjusting individual actions based on observed outcomes rather than assuming others' strategies. It aims to sustain cooperation as long as possible but defends against exploitation when necessary.

### Algorithm Implementation

```python
def decide_action(previous_stock, current_stock, is_first_round):
    if is_first_round:
        return "cooperate"
    else:
        # Determine if the stock decreased from previous round
        if current_stock < previous_stock:
            return "defect"
        else:
            return "cooperate"
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to establish a high starting stock level, which is crucial for maximizing future payoffs.

- **Stock Monitoring**: After the first round, the strategy checks whether the stock has decreased. A decrease signifies that total consumption was excessive (likely due to other players defecting), prompting a switch to defecting to avoid being exploited further.

- **Sustainability Focus**: By reacting to stock changes, the strategy aims to preserve the resource for future rounds when possible, while also ensuring that the player doesn't miss out on immediate benefits if others are defecting.

This reactive approach provides a balanced strategy that adapts dynamically based on observed outcomes, aiming to optimize both immediate and long-term payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_233 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a high initial stock level and encourage potential cooperation from other players.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Monitor the number of defectors in the previous round.
   - Assess the current stock level against a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
     - If the stock is above the threshold and fewer than half of the players defected previously, Cooperate (C) to maintain stock health.
     - If the stock is below the threshold or if more than half defected, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Always Defect (D) in the final round to secure maximum immediate gain, as there are no subsequent rounds to preserve stock for.

**Rationale:**
- This strategy balances preserving the stock for future rounds with protecting against exploitation by others.
- It adaptively responds to both stock levels and opponents' actions, employing a threshold-based approach to decide between cooperation and defection.
- The first round sets a cooperative tone, while subsequent rounds adjust based on observed behavior and stock status, ensuring robustness against various strategies.

This approach effectively navigates the dynamics of the game, aiming to maximize individual payoff while considering both current state and historical actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_234 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game with an exploitative strategy that adapts based on opponents' behavior and the game state, here is a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Opponent Behavior and Stock Levels

1. **Initial Rounds (First 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Encourage initial cooperation to establish a sustainable resource baseline and observe others' behaviors.

2. **Monitor Consumption Patterns:**
   - After each round, calculate the total consumption.
   - Compare this against the expected consumption if all players had cooperated.
     - Expected Cooperative Consumption = n * (stock/(2n)) = stock/2
   - If actual consumption exceeds expected by more than 10%, it indicates defection by some players.

3. **Adaptive Response:**
   - If defection is detected, switch to Defect (D) in the next round.
   - Continue monitoring; if cooperation resumes (actual consumption ≤ expected), revert to Cooperate.

4. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - Implement thresholds to guide actions:
     - **Upper Threshold (80% of Capacity):** Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
     - **Middle Threshold (50-80%):** Continue current strategy unless defection is detected.
     - **Lower Threshold (30-50%):** Defect to maximize payoffs as others may also defect, risking stock depletion.
     - **Critical Threshold (<30%):** Cooperate to conserve stock for future rounds.

5. **Final Rounds (Last 25% of Total Rounds):**
   - Gradually increase defection rate by 10% each round.
   - In the last round, always Defect to exploit remaining resources without fear of future repercussions.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If stock is at capacity, Cooperate to sustain it.
   - If stock is near depletion (close to 0), Defect to secure any remaining resources.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity):
    history = []  # Stores previous actions and stock levels
    stock = capacity
    
    for t in range(r):
        round_number = t + 1
        
        if round_number <= 0.25 * r:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            expected_coop_consumption = stock / 2
            actual_consumption = sum of previous round's total consumption
            if actual_consumption > expected_coop_consumption * 1.1 and len(history) >= 1:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                if stock > 0.8 * capacity:
                    action = 'C'
                elif 0.5 * capacity <= stock <= 0.8 * capacity:
                    # Check if defection is ongoing
                    if recent_defections_detected():
                        action = 'D'
                    else:
                        action = 'C'
                elif 0.3 * capacity <= stock < 0.5 * capacity:
                    action = 'D'  # Exploit as others likely defecting
                else:
                    action = 'C'  # Conserve if critically low
        
        if round_number > 0.75 * r:
            probability_defect += 0.1  # Increase defection chance each round
            action = 'D' with probability probability_defect
        
        history.append(action)
        # Update stock based on all players' actions and growth formula
        
    return history
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages a sustainable start.
- **Monitoring and Adaptation:** Quickly responds to defection by others, minimizing losses.
- **Stock Thresholds:** Ensures strategic decisions consider resource sustainability.
- **Final Rounds Exploitation:** Maximizes short-term gains when future punishment is impossible.

This strategy balances cooperation for sustainability with strategic defection to exploit opponents' actions, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_235 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can outline the following approach:

### Strategy Overview

The strategy is designed to adapt based on the game's state and history, balancing exploitation with sustainability. It starts cooperatively to encourage others to do the same, monitors their behavior, and adjusts accordingly.

### Key Components of the Strategy

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale:** Begin by cooperating to build a baseline of trust and observe how other players behave. This initial phase helps in assessing whether others are inclined towards cooperation or defection.

2. **Monitor Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Track the number of players who defected in previous rounds.
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate among opponents over the past few rounds.

3. **Adaptive Response Based on Opponent Behavior:**
   - If a significant majority (e.g., more than 75%) of opponents are cooperating, continue to cooperate but occasionally defect to exploit their cooperative nature.
   - If a moderate number (e.g., between 50% and 75%) of opponents are defecting, switch strategies to mostly defecting while maintaining some cooperation to sustain the stock.
   - If most opponents (more than 50%) are defecting, primarily defect to maximize immediate gains but include occasional cooperative actions to prevent complete depletion.

4. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - Continuously monitor the current stock level (S). If S falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), prioritize cooperation to allow stock regeneration.
   - If S is high and sustainable, defect more frequently to exploit surplus resources without jeopardizing future rounds.

5. **Late Game Strategy:**
   - In the final few rounds, especially the last round, shift towards more defection to maximize immediate payoffs since future sustainability becomes less relevant.
   - However, maintain a balance to ensure that the stock does not deplete entirely, as some stock remaining can still yield higher payoffs than complete depletion.

6. **Retaliation Mechanism:**
   - If opponents are observed defecting frequently and the stock is being depleted rapidly, temporarily switch to full defection in subsequent rounds as a form of punishment.
   - After a few rounds of retaliation, revert to the adaptive strategy based on the current state and behavior.

### Edge Cases Handling

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to set a cooperative tone and gather initial data on others' actions.
- **Last Round (r):** Maximize immediate payoff by defecting unless the stock is critically low, in which case cooperate to prevent depletion.
- **Critically Low Stock (e.g., S < 20% of capacity):** Cooperate to allow regeneration, ensuring future rounds have a sustainable stock level.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate opponent actions in previous rounds
    opponent_actions = [actions for round in history for actions in round]
    num_cooperate = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions if action == 'C')
    cooperation_rate = num_cooperate / len(opponent_actions)
    
    stock = get_current_stock()
    
    # Determine strategy based on cooperation rate and stock level
    if cooperation_rate > 0.75:
        # Exploit cooperation with occasional defection
        if random.random() < 0.2:  # 20% chance to defect
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif 0.5 <= cooperation_rate <= 0.75:
        # Balance between exploiting and conserving
        if stock > capacity * 0.7:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    else:
        # Aggressive exploitation with some conservation
        if current_round > r - 2:  # Last two rounds
            return 'D'
        elif stock < capacity * 0.2:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

    # Retaliation mechanism
    if cooperation_rate < 0.3 and stock < capacity * 0.4:
        return 'D'
    
    # Late game adjustment
    if current_round > r - 1:  # Last round
        if stock < capacity * 0.2:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

    return 'C'
```

### Explanation

This strategy begins cooperatively to encourage others to do the same and then adapts based on observed behavior and stock levels. It exploits opponents' cooperation by occasionally defecting while maintaining enough cooperation to sustain the stock. In cases of widespread defection, it shifts towards more aggressive exploitation but includes measures to prevent stock depletion. The strategy also includes mechanisms for retaliation against frequent defectors and adjusts behavior in later rounds to maximize payoffs without compromising future sustainability. This approach balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, making it robust against a variety of opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_236 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Punishment (ACP)**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Track Cooperation History**: Maintain a record of each player's actions over past rounds, noting how often they have Cooperated or Defected.

3. **Calculate Average Cooperation Rate**: Compute the average cooperation rate among all players for the last few rounds (e.g., previous 5 rounds). This helps determine the collective behavior trend.

4. **Cooperation Threshold**: Define a threshold (e.g., 70%). If the average cooperation rate is above this, continue Cooperating. This rewards consistent cooperative behavior and maintains a healthy stock level.

5. **Punishment Mechanism**: If the average cooperation rate falls below the threshold, switch to Defecting for a set number of rounds (e.g., 2-3 rounds). This punishes defectors and discourages exploitation.

6. **Stock Level Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the stock level. If it drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), prioritize cooperation to allow replenishment, even if others are defecting. This ensures future payoffs aren't jeopardized by severe depletion.

7. **Re-evaluate After Punishment**: After punishing defectors, reassess the average cooperation rate. If others return to cooperating, revert to Cooperation. This adaptability prevents unnecessary continued defection.

8. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last few rounds, especially if the stock is low, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff by Defecting, as future punishment is no longer a concern.

This strategy balances cooperation to maintain resource sustainability with strategic defection to exploit others' behavior and prevent being exploited. It adapts based on both historical actions and current stock levels, aiming to maximize total payoff while being robust against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_237 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round of a repeated game with perfect information, we developed a strategy that balances immediate gains and long-term sustainability. Here's the structured approach:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C)
   - Rationale: Start by setting a high stock level to encourage future sustainability.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - If the current stock level \( S \) is greater than \( 0.6 \times \text{capacity} \), choose Defect (D).
   - Otherwise, Cooperate (C).
   - Rationale: Exploit higher stock levels sustainably while conserving when necessary.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Always Defect (D)
   - Rationale: Maximize immediate gain as there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for.

**Summary**: The strategy cooperates initially, defects when the stock is sufficiently high to avoid depletion, and maximizes gains in the final round. This approach balances exploitation with conservation, adapting dynamically based on observed stock levels.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_238 = '''
To address the problem, I've developed a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by considering both opponents' actions and the current state of the common pool. The strategy adapts based on recent behavior and the stock level.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and observe others' initial moves.
2. **Adaptive Response**:
   - **Defection Threshold**: If more than half of the players Defected in the previous round, switch to Defecting to avoid being exploited.
   - **Stock Conservation**: If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate to help replenish the stock for future rounds.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**:
   - Action: Cooperate (C)

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Step a**: Count the number of players who Defected in the previous round.
     - If count > n/2, choose to Defect this round.
   - **Step b**: If fewer than half Defected last round, check the current stock level after growth from the previous round.
     - If stock < 50% of capacity: Cooperate (C)
     - Else: Cooperate (C)

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of others' strategies.
- **Defection Threshold**: Deters exploitation by mirroring aggressive behavior when it becomes prevalent.
- **Stock Conservation**: Prioritizes sustainability when the stock is low, ensuring future payoffs aren't jeopardized.

This strategy balances reciprocity with prudence, aiming to maximize current gains while safeguarding against depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_239 = '''
To address the strategic design for the Common Pool Resource Game, here is a structured approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize personal payoff while maintaining the sustainability of the common resource.

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy begins with an initial cooperative stance, aiming to preserve the stock and encourage others to do the same. It then adaptively switches between cooperation and defection based on observed behavior in previous rounds and the current state of the stock. This approach is designed to be exploitative yet robust against various opponent behaviors.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone, allowing the stock to remain healthy for future rounds and encouraging others to reciprocate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Previous Round's Total Consumption:**
     - If the total consumption in the previous round was high (exceeding half of the capacity), switch to Defect (D) in the current round.
       - Rationale: High consumption suggests other players are defecting, and cooperating further would be exploited. Defecting here aims to capture a higher personal payoff before the stock depletes further.

   - **Stock Recovery Threshold:**
     - If the current stock level drops below 25% of capacity, switch back to Cooperate (C).
       - Rationale: Cooperating when the stock is low allows it to regrow, preventing depletion and ensuring future payoffs are sustainable.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
     - Rationale: In the final round, defecting maximizes immediate payoff since there's no subsequent round where stock depletion would negatively impact your strategy.

4. **Adaptive Forgiveness:**
   - After switching to Defect due to high consumption, periodically revert to Cooperate if the stock begins to recover.
     - Rationale: This prevents the strategy from getting stuck in a cycle of endless defection and allows for potential renewal of cooperation if others change their behavior.

### Pseudocode Representation:
```python
def strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, total_consumption_history):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    
    previous_total = total_consumption_history[-1]
    threshold = capacity / 2
    
    if previous_total >= threshold:
        # Defect if last round's consumption was high
        return "D"
    elif current_stock < (capacity * 0.25):
        # Cooperate to recover stock
        return "C"
    else:
        # Continue with the current strategy, defaulting to cooperate unless conditions met
        return "C"

# Note: In the last round, force return "D" regardless of other conditions.
```

### Conclusion:
This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, balancing cooperation to maintain stock health while defecting strategically when others exploit the resource. It ensures that personal payoffs are maximized over the game's duration by being responsive to both the current state and historical actions of other players.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_240 = '''
To address the problem of deciding between Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in a repeated game with perfect information, we can use an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with self-interest. The strategy involves:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to maximize collective gain.
2. **Monitor Stock Trends**: Track the stock level after each round to detect if it's being depleted unsustainably.
3. **Adaptive Switching**: If the stock decreases significantly over consecutive rounds, switch to defecting to avoid exploitation.
4. **Endgame Strategy**: Always defect in the last round since there's no future stock to preserve.

### Strategy Details:

- **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to observe others' behavior and start with maximum cooperation.
- **Middle Rounds**: After each round, check if the stock has decreased significantly compared to the previous round. If it decreases consecutively beyond a set threshold (e.g., 10%), switch to defecting permanently.
- **Last Round**: Always defect (D) to maximize personal gain without regard for future consequences.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, r):
    stock_history = [capacity]  # Initial stock before any rounds
    defect_rest = False
    consecutive_decreases = 0
    threshold_decrease = -0.1  # 10% decrease

    actions = []

    for t in range(1, r + 1):
        if defect_rest or t == r:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            if t == 1:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                current_stock = stock_history[-1]
                prev_stock = stock_history[-2]
                delta = (current_stock - prev_stock) / prev_stock
                if delta < threshold_decrease:
                    consecutive_decreases += 1
                else:
                    consecutive_decreases = 0

                if consecutive_decreases >= 2:
                    defect_rest = True
                    action = 'D'
                else:
                    action = 'C'

        actions.append(action)
        # Simulate the round and get new_stock (this part is hypothetical)
        if action == 'C':
            # Calculate total consumption as per cooperation logic
            pass
        else:
            # Calculate total consumption as per defecting logic
            pass

        # For demonstration, assume new_stock is calculated based on actions
        # In reality, this would be provided by the environment or game mechanics
        new_stock = capacity  # Placeholder; actual value depends on all players' actions
        stock_history.append(new_stock)

    return actions

# Example usage:
actions = strategy(5, 1000, 10)
print(actions)  # Prints the sequence of C and D based on the strategy
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization**: The strategy starts with the initial stock level at capacity.
- **First Round Action**: Cooperate to maximize collective gain and observe others' behavior.
- **Middle Rounds Monitoring**: After each round, check if the stock has decreased by more than 10% from the previous round. If this happens twice consecutively, switch to defecting permanently.
- **Last Round Action**: Always defect in the final round to maximize personal gain without worrying about future depletion.

This approach ensures that you cooperate as long as others do, but adapt and defect if the stock starts to deplete unsustainably, thus optimizing your payoffs over the game's duration.

To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round of a repeated game, where the goal is to maximize personal payoff while considering the sustainability of the resource, we can outline the following strategy:

### Strategy Outline:
1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate.
   - This sets an initial cooperative tone and allows observation of how others' actions affect the stock level.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - **Threshold Check**: Compare the current stock level (S) before any actions in the round with half of the capacity (0.5 * capacity).
     - If S > 0.5 * capacity: Cooperate.
     - If S ≤ 0.5 * capacity: Defect.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Always Defect.
   - Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider sustainability for.

### Rationale:
- **Cooperation Threshold**: By cooperating when the stock is above half of its capacity, we aim to maintain a sustainable resource level that allows for continued payoffs in subsequent rounds. This threshold serves as an indicator of whether the resource is being managed sustainably or if it's under significant stress.
  
- **Defection Trigger**: If the stock drops below the threshold, it suggests that other players may be defecting frequently, and continuing to cooperate without reciprocation would lead to a worse personal payoff. Defecting then becomes a strategic response to maximize one's own gain.

- **Final Round Defection**: Since there are no future rounds after the last one, there’s no incentive to maintain cooperation for long-term sustainability. Defecting in the final round ensures the highest possible immediate payoff.

This strategy balances between contributing to resource sustainability and maximizing personal gain by reacting to observable changes in the stock level without needing to know others' exact actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_242 = '''
To design an effective exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on balancing immediate gains with preserving the stock for future rounds. The strategy adapts based on the current stock level relative to capacity, ensuring responsiveness without assuming others' cooperation.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Level

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C). This initial move tests the waters and sets a baseline for stock behavior.
   
2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - **Cooperate Threshold**: If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, continue cooperating. This helps maintain or increase the stock, ensuring future payoffs.
   - **Defect Threshold**: If the stock drops below 50% of capacity, switch to defecting (D). This maximizes immediate payoffs when the stock is under threat from others' potential defection.

3. **Last Round Action**: Always Defect (D). With no future rounds to consider, prioritize maximizing your final payoff without concern for stock depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity):
    current_stock = capacity
    for round in range(1, r+1):
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        elif round == r:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'
        # Execute action and update current_stock based on game dynamics
        # (Implementation details for stock update omitted)
    return total_payoff

# Example usage
strategy = adaptive_exploitation(n=4, r=10, capacity=100)
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, the strategy encourages stock stability and observes others' behavior.
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: The 50% threshold acts as a trigger to switch strategies, ensuring responsiveness to potential overexploitation by others.
- **Final Round Defection**: Maximizes immediate gain when future consequences no longer matter.

This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors, balancing exploitation with resource preservation.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate for the first round to encourage others to cooperate and gather initial data on their actions.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**: After the initial rounds, assess the average cooperation rate of other players over the past few rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds). If the majority (more than 50%) have cooperated, continue cooperating. Additionally, monitor the stock level after regrowth; if it remains above a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), cooperate to sustain long-term gains.
   - **Stock Threshold**: If the stock drops below the specified threshold, switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoffs before further depletion occurs.
   - **Final Round**: Always defect in the last round to secure maximum possible payoff without future repercussions.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and observe others' initial moves.
   - **Low Stock Levels**: If stock after regrowth falls below 70% of capacity, switch to defection to exploit the resource while possible.
   - **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

3. **Exploitative Approach**:
   - The strategy is designed to exploit others' cooperative behavior by maintaining cooperation when beneficial and switching to defection when others defect or when stock levels are unsustainable. This ensures the player maximizes their own payoffs without relying on others' coordination.

**Pseudocode Summary**:

```
Initialize:
    cooperation_threshold = 0.5
    stock_threshold = capacity * 0.7

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round:
        action = C
    elif it's the last round:
        action = D
    else:
        calculate average_cooperation = (total past C choices) / (n * number of previous rounds)
        if stock > stock_threshold and average_cooperation >= cooperation_threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D

    take action and update history
```

This strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable use, adapting to both the actions of others and the state of the resource.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_244 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in the Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First m Rounds):**
   - Cooperate for the first few rounds (e.g., 3-5 rounds) to observe other players' behavior without immediately exploiting. This establishes a baseline of cooperation and allows you to gather information on others' tendencies.

2. **Monitor Defection Rate:**
   - Track the number of defections in each round. Calculate the average defection rate over the observed history (e.g., last k rounds).

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - If the average defection rate is below a threshold (e.g., 30%), continue cooperating to sustain the resource and maximize mutual benefits.
   - If the defection rate exceeds this threshold, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds to exploit others' cooperation and protect your payoffs.

4. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Implement a "Tit-for-Tat" approach for a few rounds after observing significant defections. Defect for a round or two to punish defectors before reassessing the cooperation climate.
   
5. **Stock-Level Adaptation:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level relative to capacity. If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch back to cooperating temporarily to allow regeneration, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.

6. **Endgame Strategy (Last p Rounds):**
   - In the final rounds (e.g., last 5-10%), always defect regardless of previous behavior. Since there are no future consequences, maximize immediate payoffs.

7. **Robustness and Adaptability:**
   - Maintain flexibility to adjust thresholds based on observed opponent strategies and game dynamics. Use historical data to refine your response to different patterns of cooperation and defection.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```python
def strategy(current_stock, capacity, round_number, history):
    n = number_of_players
    total_rounds = r
    
    if round_number <= initial_coop_rounds:
        return "C"
    
    avg_defection_rate = calculate_defection_rate(history)
    
    if avg_defection_rate > 0.3:
        return "D"
    
    if current_stock < 0.2 * capacity:
        return "C"
    
    if round_number > total_rounds - endgame_rounds:
        return "D"
    
    recent_coop = check_recent_actions(history)
    if recent_coop >= 0.7:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

def calculate_defection_rate(history):
    # Calculate average defection rate over last k rounds
    pass

def check_recent_actions(history):
    # Check percentage of cooperative actions in recent rounds
    pass
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating to set a cooperative tone and gather information on others' strategies.
- **Defection Monitoring:** Track how often others defect. If they frequently defect, switch to exploiting the resource to avoid being taken advantage of.
- **Punishment Phase:** Occasionally punish defectors by briefly switching to defection to discourage selfish behavior.
- **Stock Management:** Adjust strategy based on stock levels to prevent depletion and ensure long-term exploitation opportunities.
- **Endgame Focus:** In final rounds, prioritize immediate gains since there are no future repercussions.

This strategy aims to balance cooperation with strategic exploitation, adapting dynamically based on both the game's state and opponents' actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_245 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocal Conservation (ARC)**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone and gathers information on others' strategies.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - Calculate the number of players who defected in the previous round (D_count).
     - Determine the stock level after regrowth from the last round (S_current).
     - If D_count exceeds a threshold (e.g., more than 30% of players defected) OR if S_current is below a conservation threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to Defect (D) for this round.
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round:** Defect (D). Since there's no future stock to preserve, maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If S_current is critically low (e.g., below 10% of capacity), Cooperate to allow regrowth, ensuring some resource availability even if others defect.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - The strategy adapts based on opponents' actions and stock health, aiming to balance between exploiting the resource and preserving it for future use.
   - Punishes excessive defection by switching to Defect, discouraging exploitation without cooperation.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def ARC_strategy(n, capacity, r, history, current_stock):
    if len(history) == 0:
        return "C"
    else:
        D_count = sum(1 for action in history[-1] if action == 'D')
        stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
        
        threshold_defection = 0.3 * n
        conservation_threshold = 0.2
        
        if r == current_round:
            return "D"
        else:
            if D_count > threshold_defection or stock_ratio < conservation_threshold:
                return "D"
            else:
                return "C"

This strategy promotes cooperation while being vigilant against exploitation, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_246 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we aim to maximize individual payoffs by adaptively choosing between cooperation and defection based on the current state of the common pool. The strategy balances immediate gains with sustainable resource use, considering both the stock level and past behavior.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Level

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline and observe initial outcomes without immediately depleting resources.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds don't matter.
   - **Stock Evaluation**: For other rounds, evaluate the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If the stock is above 66% of capacity, Defect (D). This allows taking advantage of a plentiful resource while leaving enough for regrowth.
     - If the stock is below or equal to 66%, Cooperate (C) to help sustain and replenish the resource for future rounds.

3. **Rationale**:
   - **High Stock Levels**: When resources are abundant, defecting maximizes immediate gains without severely impacting future payoffs due to the stock's ability to regrow.
   - **Low Stock Levels**: Cooperating when the stock is low helps maintain a sustainable level, ensuring that future rounds still offer significant payoffs.

This strategy adaptively adjusts behavior based on resource availability, exploiting high stocks while preserving them during scarcity.

   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - Monitor the stock level after each round.
     - If the current stock is above 50% of capacity, cooperate to maintain sustainability.
     - If the stock drops below 50%, defect to maximize immediate payoff while ensuring some stock remains for future rounds.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Initiate cooperation to promote a sustainable start.
   - **Last Round (r):** Defect to secure maximum immediate gain, as there are no subsequent rounds to consider.
   - **Critical Stock Level (20% of capacity):** If the stock falls below this threshold, defect to prevent depletion and ensure minimal future payoffs.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - Continuously assess the stock level and adapt actions to balance sustainability with self-interest.
   - Cooperate when the stock is healthy to maintain future opportunities; defect when necessary to avoid exploitation and secure immediate benefits.

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while considering both current conditions and potential future outcomes, ensuring a robust approach against various opponent behaviors.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_248 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to cooperate or defect in a game where players can either take a conservative amount (cooperate) or a larger amount (defect), we propose a threshold-based strategy. This approach balances between preserving resources for future rounds and exploiting them when necessary.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to avoid immediate depletion of resources.
2. **Stock Level Monitoring**:
   - In each subsequent round, check if the current stock level (S) is above 50% of the game's capacity.
     - If S > 50% of capacity, continue to cooperate. This allows the stock to potentially grow or remain stable for future rounds.
     - If S ≤ 50% of capacity, switch to defecting. This ensures that you secure resources before they are depleted by others.
3. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last few rounds (e.g., when fewer than 5 rounds remain), always choose to defect. This maximizes your gain since future rounds become less significant.

### Rationale:

- **Cooperation When Stock is High**: By cooperating when stock levels are plentiful, you help maintain or grow the resource pool, ensuring sustainability for more rounds.
- **Defection When Stock is Low**: When resources dwindle below a critical threshold (50% of capacity), defecting becomes advantageous to secure what remains before others take it.
- **Endgame Defection**: In the final stages, prioritizing immediate gain over conservation makes sense as future depletion concerns are moot.

This strategy aims to balance sustainability with opportunism, ensuring you maximize your gains while considering the game's progression.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_249 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round of a dynamic game with perfect information, we can employ a heuristic-based strategy that reacts to changes in the stock level. This approach helps balance personal payoff maximization while considering collective behavior.

**Strategy:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - Choose to **Cooperate**. This sets a baseline for subsequent decisions and avoids immediate exploitation if others might be Cooperating.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to T-1):**
   - After each round, observe the stock level \( S_t \) at the end of the round.
   - Compare \( S_t \) with the previous round's stock level \( S_{t-1} \).
     - If \( S_t \) has decreased by more than **10%** from \( S_{t-1} \), choose to **Defect** in the next round (Round \( t+1 \)).
     - If the decrease is **10% or less**, continue to **Cooperate**.
   - This threshold of 10% serves as an indicator of potential over-consumption by other players, prompting a strategic switch to Defect.

3. **Final Round (Round T):**
   - Regardless of previous actions, choose to **Defect** in the final round to maximize immediate personal payoff without concern for future repercussions.

**Rationale:**

- **Cooperation in Early Rounds:** Encourages initial resource sustainability and avoids being labeled as a defector early on.
- **Reaction to Stock Decline:** A significant drop (e.g., 10%) suggests others are defecting, making it rational to switch strategies to avoid being exploited.
- **Defection in the Last Round:** Maximizes personal gain when future consequences no longer matter.

This strategy adaptively responds to collective behavior while aiming to optimize individual payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_250 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline and avoid initial depletion.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Calculate the estimated cooperation rate of other players based on the previous round's stock change.
  - If the majority (e.g., >70%) are cooperating, continue to Cooperate.
  - If significant defection is detected, switch to Defecting to exploit the resource before depletion accelerates.
  - As the game progresses towards the final rounds, gradually increase the tendency to Defect, especially in the last few rounds.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **Low Stock Levels:** When stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), prioritize Defecting to maximize immediate gains.
- **Final Rounds:** In the last round or when only a few rounds remain, always choose Defect to secure maximum payoff without regard for future sustainability.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
- Continuously monitor the stock's health and adjust actions dynamically based on others' behavior.
- Balance between preserving resource longevity for future gains and exploiting current opportunities to maximize payoffs.

     - **Low Stock (<40%):** Defect (D) to prioritize immediate gain as conservation is less effective.

   - **Consider Remaining Rounds:**
     - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) since no future rounds are affected.
     - **Second Last Round:** Increase defection to maximize current payoff, considering the next round's impact.

   - **Monitor Others' Behavior:** Track recent defections (last 3-5 rounds). If others defect frequently, adapt by increasing own defection rate.

3. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Continuously update thresholds based on observed behavior and stock trends.
   - Use a reciprocity approach: Cooperate if others do, Defect if they don't.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Stock Near Zero:** Prioritize immediate gain by defecting.
   - **Final Stages:** Increase defection rate to maximize payoffs as future rounds diminish in importance.

To address the challenge of balancing individual gain with the preservation of a common resource over multiple rounds, we can employ a responsive strategy that adapts based on the current state and trends of the resource. This approach ensures sustainability while allowing for strategic exploitation in the final round.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline and observe the initial impact on the resource.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (until the last round):**
   - If the current stock is below 50% of its capacity, cooperate to help replenish it.
   - Monitor the trend in stock levels over recent rounds; if the stock is decreasing, switch to cooperation to prevent depletion.
   - If the stock is stable or increasing and above the threshold, defect to maximize personal gain.
3. **Final Round:** Always defect to secure maximum immediate benefit.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate unconditionally in the first round to establish an initial observation point without immediately impacting the resource negatively.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Level Check:** If the current stock is below 50% of its maximum capacity, choose to cooperate to help the resource recover and sustain future rounds.
   - **Trend Analysis:** Examine the trend in stock levels over the previous two rounds. If there's a noticeable decrease (indicating potential overexploitation), switch to cooperation to mitigate further depletion.
   - **Defection Decision:** When the stock is stable or increasing above the 50% threshold, defect to maximize personal gain without immediately endangering the resource.

3. **Final Round Action:**
   - In the last round, always choose to defect to secure maximum immediate benefit, as there are no subsequent rounds to consider for sustainability.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def determine_action(current_stock, capacity, is_last_round, stock_history):
    if not stock_history:
        return 'C'  # First round action

    if is_last_round:
        return 'D'

    if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
        return 'C'

    recent_stocks = stock_history[-2:]
    if len(recent_stocks) == 1:
        previous_stock = recent_stocks[0]
    else:
        # Calculate average of last two stocks
        avg_recent = sum(recent_stocks) / len(recent_stocks)
        previous_stock = stock_history[-3] if len(stock_history) >= 3 else avg_recent

    current_trend = (current_stock > previous_stock)

    if not current_trend:
        return 'C'

    return 'D'
```

### Explanation:

- **First Round:** The strategy begins with cooperation to avoid immediate depletion and gather initial data on the resource's state.
- **Stock Level Check:** By setting a 50% threshold, the strategy ensures that when the resource is significantly depleted, conservation through cooperation is prioritized.
- **Trend Analysis:** Monitoring whether the stock is decreasing over recent rounds helps identify if others are overexploiting, prompting a shift towards cooperation to prevent collapse.
- **Final Round Defection:** Maximizing gain in the last round without regard for future sustainability as there are no subsequent rounds to affect.

This approach balances individual self-interest with collective resource management, ensuring that while personal gains are pursued, the resource remains viable for as long as possible.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_253 = '''
To determine whether to cooperate or defect in each round of the game, we follow a strategic approach that balances maintaining a sustainable stock level with maximizing personal gain. Here's how you can decide your move:

1. **First Round:** Always Cooperate. This helps establish a baseline of cooperation and maintains the stock at its maximum capacity.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If it is the final round (t = r), always Defect to maximize your immediate gain since there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for.
   - For other rounds, check if the total consumption in the previous round exceeded half of the initial stock for that round:
     - **If yes**, choose to Defect. This is because others are overexploiting, and defecting ensures you get a higher payoff before the stock depletes further.
     - **If no**, continue to Cooperate. This maintains the stock at a sustainable level, ensuring long-term availability.

By following this strategy, you adapt your behavior based on others' actions while balancing immediate gains with sustainability.

**Final Answer:**

In each round after the first, defect if last round's total consumption exceeded half of its initial stock; otherwise, cooperate. Always defect in the final round.

\boxed{\text{Defect if previous round's consumption exceeded half the stock; else Cooperate.}}

To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I've developed a structured approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy adapts based on both the game's state and the actions of other players.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish an initial cooperative tone and observe others' reactions without immediately exploiting.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Observe Previous Actions:** Count the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - **Threshold for Defection:**
     - If more than half of the players defected last round, switch to defecting this round. This prevents being exploited by others' greed.
     - Additionally, if the current stock level falls below 50% of the capacity, cooperate to help replenish the stock for future rounds.
   - **Adjust Strategy Dynamically:** If either condition is met (excessive defection or low stock), defect; otherwise, continue cooperating.

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Regardless of previous actions or stock levels, defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

### Decision Rules:

- **First Round:** Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** Defect if more than half defected last round or if current stock is below 50% of capacity; otherwise, cooperate.
- **Last Round:** Always defect.

### Handling Edge Cases:

- **Stock Recovery:** If the stock is low, cooperation is prioritized to ensure future payoffs are sustainable.
- **Social Dynamics:** Reacts to others' behavior by defecting when exploitation is rampant, preventing being taken advantage of.

This strategy ensures a balance between exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs and maintaining resource sustainability for continued benefits.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_255 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to cooperate or defect in a dynamic resource game, we developed an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with self-interest. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage sustainability and maximize group payoff if others follow suit.
2. **Stock Monitoring**: After each round, monitor the stock level. If it drops below a threshold (50% of capacity), switch to defecting in subsequent rounds except the last one.
3. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, always choose to defect to maximize immediate personal gain without concern for future sustainability.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **First Round Cooperation**:
   - Cooperate to promote a sustainable resource level and higher total payoff if others also cooperate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - After each round, observe the current stock level.
   - If the stock has dropped below 50% of its capacity, switch strategy to defecting in the next rounds. This is because a significant drop indicates others are likely defecting, and further cooperation may not be beneficial.
   - Continue cooperating if the stock remains above the threshold.

3. **Last Round Defection**:
   - Regardless of the stock level, always defect in the final round to maximize immediate personal gain since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Threshold Determination:
- The threshold is set at 50% of the resource capacity. This serves as a clear indicator of significant depletion and potential widespread defection among participants.

This strategy effectively balances cooperation with strategic defection, aiming to optimize both sustainability and personal gain in dynamic game environments.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Level and Opponent Behavior

#### 1. Decision Rules:
The strategy will adapt its cooperation or defection based on the current stock level relative to capacity and observed opponent behavior:

- **Monitor the Stock Level**: Track the stock level at the end of each round.
- **Threshold Rule**: 
  - If the stock level is above 50% of capacity, defect (play D). This exploits surplus without risking immediate depletion.
  - If the stock level is below or equal to 50%, cooperate (play C) to sustain the resource.

#### 2. Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to encourage initial cooperation and maximize collective payoff.
- **Last Round (r)**: Defect (D) to maximize immediate gain since there’s no future stock to preserve.

#### 3. Exploitative Elements:
- **Stock Growth Incentive**: By cooperating when the stock is low, you incentivize growth for future exploitation.
- **Opponent Behavior Monitoring**: Adapt based on observed actions to avoid being exploited and exploit others' cooperation.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_t, total_rounds_r):
    if round_t == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round_t == total_rounds_r:
        return "D"
    else:
        threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
```

### Explanation:
- **Adaptive Cooperation**: Cooperates when the stock is low to ensure sustainability and future payoffs.
- **Exploitative Defection**: Defects when there's surplus, maximizing immediate gains without risking depletion.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Encourages cooperation initially and defects in the final round for maximum payoff.

This strategy balances exploitation with resource preservation, adapting dynamically based on stock levels to optimize total payoffs across all rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_257 = '''
To maximize your payoff while maintaining a sustainable stock level for future rounds, adopt a threshold-based strategy that balances exploitation with preservation. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Initial Round**: Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and avoid immediate depletion of the stock.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each round, observe the current stock level (S) relative to the capacity (C).

3. **Set Thresholds**:
   - **Upper Threshold (80% of Capacity)**: If S is above 80%, defect (D) to take advantage of the high stock while it's sustainable.
   - **Lower Threshold (60% of Capacity)**: If S drops below 60%, cooperate (C) to help replenish the stock.
   - **Buffer Zone (60%-80%)**: Maintain your previous action to avoid rapid strategy oscillations.

4. **Adjustment Mechanism**: If the stock trends downward despite cooperation, consider lowering the upper threshold for defection. Conversely, if cooperation successfully increases the stock, you might raise the lower threshold.

This approach ensures that you exploit high stock levels while cooperating enough to sustain the resource for future exploitation.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative precedent and observe others' actions.
   
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** After each round, if the stock level after consumption falls below half of the capacity, switch to Cooperate in the next round to facilitate regrowth.
   - **Defection Analysis:** Track the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than half defected, choose Defect (D) in the current round to protect your payoff.

3. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - Always Defect (D) in the final round to maximize immediate gain without concern for future stock levels.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection, aiming to sustain the resource while protecting against exploitation by others. It dynamically adjusts based on observed actions and stock conditions, ensuring robustness across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_259 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can adapt a modified version of Tit-for-Tat (TFT) that incorporates elements of reciprocity and stock conservation. This strategy aims to balance cooperation with the temptation to defect, ensuring long-term sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs.

### Strategy Design: "Adaptive Reciprocal Conservation"

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and establishes a baseline for reciprocal behavior.

2. **Reciprocity Mechanism**:
   - ** Cooperate if most players cooperated previously**: Continue cooperating if at least half of the players chose to cooperate in the previous round.
   - **Defect if many defected previously**: If fewer than half cooperated, switch to defecting (D) to avoid being exploited by frequent defectors.

3. **Stock Conservation Threshold**:
   - Monitor the current stock level. If it falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), temporarily shift towards cooperation to conserve resources and prevent depletion.
   - Adjust your action based on recent stock trends: if the stock is decreasing, lean towards cooperation; if it's stable or increasing, consider defecting more.

4. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - In the final round (r), prioritize immediate payoff by choosing D to maximize personal gain since there are no future consequences.
   - As the game progresses towards the end, gradually increase defection rates to exploit any remaining resources without concern for future reciprocity.

### Decision Rules in Pseudocode

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, stock, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    previous_actions = history[-1]
    num_cooperate_last = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'C')
    
    if (num_cooperate_last / n) >= 0.5 and stock > 0.5 * capacity:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

    if current_round == r:
        return "D"
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation encourages others to reciprocate, potentially leading to mutually beneficial outcomes.
- **Reciprocity Mechanism**: By mirroring the majority's previous actions, this strategy incentivizes others to maintain cooperation while protecting against exploitation.
- **Stock Conservation**: Adjusting based on stock levels ensures that the resource remains viable for future rounds, preventing premature depletion.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Maximizing personal gain in the final round aligns with the exploitative mindset, as there's no future punishment.

This strategy is robust and adaptive, balancing between exploiting defectors and maintaining a sustainable resource for continued payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_260 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for playing the cooperation game, I have developed a comprehensive approach based on the analysis provided. This strategy balances cooperation and defection to maximize individual payoff while considering the sustainability of the common resource (stock). The strategy incorporates elements of reciprocity, stock management, and endgame considerations.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage initial stock stability.
2. **Endgame Defection**: In the last 10% of the rounds, always defect to maximize current payoff since future consequences are limited.
3. **Stock-Level Consideration**: Cooperate if the current stock is below half the capacity to aid in replenishment and ensure future resources.
4. **Reciprocity Based on Past Actions**: Calculate the proportion of cooperative actions by all players in previous rounds. If this proportion is at least 50%, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect.

### Step-by-Step Strategy

1. **First Round**:
   - Cooperate to establish a stable stock level and encourage others to cooperate initially.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t)**:
   - **Endgame Phase**: If the current round is among the last 10% of total rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - **Low Stock Condition**: If the current stock (S_t) is below half the capacity, cooperate to help replenish the stock for future use.
   - **Reciprocity Check**:
     - Calculate the proportion of cooperative actions by all players in previous rounds: Proportion_C = Total Cooperate Actions / (n * (t-1)).
     - If Proportion_C ≥ 0.5, continue cooperating to maintain a sustainable stock level.
     - If Proportion_C < 0.5, defect to take advantage of others' lack of cooperation.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages a stable start and may promote cooperative behavior among other players.
- **Endgame Defection**: Maximizes payoff in the final stages when future rounds are limited, reducing the impact of stock depletion.
- **Stock Management**: Cooperating when stock is low ensures resource availability for future rounds, preventing premature depletion.
- **Reciprocity**: Encourages cooperation if others are cooperative, while defecting punishes lack of cooperation, promoting a balanced approach.

This strategy dynamically adapts to both the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players, ensuring a balance between self-interest and resource sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_261 = '''
To address the problem of determining an optimal strategy for defecting or cooperating in a repeated game scenario, we have developed a systematic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability of resources (stock). This strategy is designed to be adaptive based on both the current state of the stock and the actions of other players.

### Strategy Name: Adaptive Exploitation

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff while ensuring resource sustainability through adaptive decisions based on stock levels and opponents' past actions.

---

#### Parameters:
- **n**: Number of players.
- **r**: Total number of rounds in the game.
- **capacity**: Maximum possible value of the stock.

---

#### State Variables:
- **current_stock**: The current level of the stock at the beginning of each round.
- **previous_actions**: A list recording the actions (C or D) of all players in the previous round.
- **stock_history**: A list tracking the stock levels over past rounds to determine trends.

---

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - *Rationale:* Start by cooperating to avoid immediate depletion and allow others to potentially build trust or resources.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (from round 2 to round r-1):**
   a. **Stock Check:**
      - If **current_stock** is below a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) OR if the stock trend indicates a decrease:
          - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
            - *Rationale:* Prioritize resource recovery to ensure future rounds have sufficient stock.
   b. **Opponents' Actions Check:**
      - Count the number of players who defected in the previous round (**count_defects**).
         - If **count_defects** ≥ n/2:
             - **Action:** Defect (D)
               - *Rationale:* Join the majority to maximize immediate payoff when many are exploiting.
   c. **Exploitation Opportunity:**
      - If stock is above threshold and not decreasing, and fewer than half defected last round:
          - **Action:** Defect (D)
            - *Rationale:* Exploit the situation to gain higher payoffs while the stock can sustain it.

3. **Last Round (round r):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect (D)
     - *Rationale:* Maximize immediate payoff as there are no future consequences for resource depletion.

---

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Record initial stock level.
   - Prepare data structures to track actions and stock history.

2. **Round Loop:**
   - For each round from 1 to r:
     a. If it's the first round, choose Cooperate (C).
     b. Else if it's the last round, choose Defect (D).
     c. For other rounds:
        i. Determine if current_stock is below threshold or stock trend is decreasing.
           - **If yes:** Choose Cooperate (C) to conserve resources.
           - **Else:** Check count_defects from previous_actions.
               - **If count_defects ≥ n/2:** Choose Defect (D).
               - **Else:** Choose Defect (D) to exploit the cooperative behavior of others.

3. **Update History:**
   - After each round, update stock_history with current_stock and record actions for next round's analysis.

---

### Code Implementation (Pseudocode):

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity):
    # Initialize variables
    previous_actions = []
    stock_history = []
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity

    for t in range(1, r+1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'C'
        elif t == r:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            # Calculate current stock trend
            avg_stock = sum(stock_history[-3:]) / len(stock_history[-3:]) if len(stock_history) >=3 else None
            is_decreasing = False
            if avg_stock is not None and current_stock < avg_stock:
                is_decreasing = True

            # Determine if below threshold or decreasing trend
            if current_stock < threshold or is_decreasing:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                count_defects = sum(1 for a in previous_actions[-n:] if a == 'D')
                if count_defects >= n / 2:
                    action = 'D'
                else:
                    action = 'D'  # Exploit when others are not defecting much

        # Record the action and update histories
        previous_actions.append(action)
        stock_history.append(current_stock)

    return action_sequence
```

---

### Explanation:

- **First Round Cooperation:** Ensures initial resource conservation.
- **Stock Check:** Prevents over-exploitation by ensuring resources are not depleted below a critical level.
- **Majority Defection Rule:** Encourages following the majority to maximize immediate gains when others are defecting.
- **Exploitation Opportunity:** Allows for higher payoffs when the stock is healthy, and others' cooperation can be exploited without significant resource risk.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on both environmental factors (stock levels) and social factors (others' actions).
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_262 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and maintain initial stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Cooperation Rate:** Track the average cooperation rate of other players in previous rounds.
     - If the majority (above 50%) have Cooperated, continue Cooperating.
     - If fewer than 50% Cooperate, switch to Defecting.
   - **Stock Health Check:** Assess if the stock is above a healthy threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity).
     - If stock is healthy and others are mostly Cooperative, Cooperate.
     - If stock is low or others are mostly Defecting, Defect.

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without future repercussions.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
Initialize:
    action = C  # First round action
    cooperation_threshold = 0.5  # Adjust based on risk preference
    stock_health_threshold = 0.75  # Of capacity

For each round from 2 to r:
    calculate others_cooperation_rate = average of other players' past Cooperate actions
    if current_stock > (stock_health_threshold * capacity) and others_cooperation_rate >= cooperation_threshold:
        action = C
    else:
        action = D

If it's the last round:
    action = D

Execute action and update history.
```

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, adapting to opponents' behavior while safeguarding against stock depletion. It ensures exploitative tendencies by capitalizing on others' cooperation while protecting against exploitation through timely defections.
'''

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Sustainability**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establishes a baseline of trust and maximizes initial stock growth, ensuring a healthy starting point for subsequent rounds.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation (Subsequent Rounds):**
   - **Observation:** After each round, assess the number of players who defected in the previous round and evaluate the current stock level.
   - **Thresholds:**
     - If the average cooperation rate falls below 50%, indicating a significant number of defectors, switch to Defect (D) in the next round.
     - If the stock drops below 80% of capacity, consider defecting to secure payoffs before potential depletion.

3. **Reactive Strategy Adjustment:**
   - **Tit-for-Tat Inspired:** Mirror the majority's behavior from the previous round. If most players defected, defect; otherwise, cooperate.
   - **Stock-Level Consideration:** Cooperate if the stock is above a sustainable threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) to encourage growth and future payoffs.

4. **Final Round Strategy:**
   - **Action:** Decide based on current stock level.
     - If the stock is high (above 50% of capacity), Cooperate to maintain fairness and potential future interactions beyond the game.
     - If the stock is low, Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as future rounds are no longer a concern.

**Summary:**
This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. It begins cooperatively to foster trust and resource growth but adapts by defecting if others exploit or if the stock is at risk. The approach ensures robustness against various behaviors while maintaining exploitative potential when beneficial.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_264 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that maximizes your total payoff while being robust against various opponent behaviors, follow this structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Level

1. **First Round Action**:
   - **Cooperate (C)**: Start by cooperating to observe the initial impact of others' actions and preserve the stock for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Monitor Stock Level**: After each round, check the current stock level relative to the game's capacity.
   - **Decision Rule**:
     - If the current stock is above **70% of the capacity**, choose to **Defect (D)**. This allows you to exploit the resource when it's plentiful, maximizing immediate gain while there's enough stock to sustain growth.
     - If the current stock is at or below **70% of the capacity**, choose to **Cooperate (C)**. This helps conserve the stock for future rounds, ensuring sustainability and preventing depletion.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - **Defect (D)**: In the final round, prioritize immediate gain by defecting to take as much as possible from the current stock, as there are no subsequent rounds to consider.

### Rationale

- **First Round Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, you avoid immediate depletion and set a baseline for observing others' behavior.
- **Stock Level Threshold (70% Capacity)**: This threshold balances exploiting when resources are abundant while conserving when they're scarce. It ensures that you don't over-exploit, which could lead to future stock crashes.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Since there's no future consequence in the last round, defecting maximizes your immediate payoff.

### Edge Cases and Considerations

- **High Number of Players (n)**: With more players, each individual impact on the stock is smaller. The strategy remains effective as it focuses on overall stock level rather than individual contributions.
- **Large Capacity**: A higher capacity allows for a higher threshold before switching to cooperation, but the 70% rule remains robust.

This approach is adaptive and exploitative, aiming to maximize your total payoff by dynamically adjusting based on the game's state while being resilient against diverse strategies from other players.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_265 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a dynamic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. This strategy adapts based on the game's state and the behavior of other players, ensuring robustness across various scenarios.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation (AE)

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Round (Round 1):** Cooperate to establish a high initial stock level.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Monitor the current stock level and the number of defectors from the previous round.
  - If the stock is above 75% of capacity and more than half of the players defected last round, defect. Otherwise, cooperate.
  - If the stock falls below 25%, switch to cooperating to facilitate regrowth.
- **Endgame (Last Two Rounds):** Shift towards defecting to maximize immediate payoffs as future consequences diminish.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **Low Stock (S < 25% of capacity):** Cooperate to help replenish the stock.
- **Stock Depletion (S = 0):** Defect as there's no benefit in cooperating when the resource is exhausted.

**3. Exploitative Mindset:**
The strategy aims to exploit others' cooperation by defecting when it's safe, while maintaining the resource for future exploitation through cooperative actions when necessary.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, current_stock, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    previous_actions = history[-1]
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    
    if stock_ratio > 0.75 and num_defectors >= n/2:
        return "D"
    elif stock_ratio < 0.25:
        return "C"
    
    if current_round + 1 >= r:  # Last two rounds
        return "D"
    
    # Default to cooperation if conditions not met
    return "C"
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to maintain a high stock level, encouraging sustainability.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Uses the stock level and others' past actions to decide whether to defect or cooperate, ensuring that exploitation is balanced with resource maintenance.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Prioritizes immediate gains in the final rounds when future consequences are less relevant.

This strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, ensuring both short-term gains and long-term resource sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_266 = '''
To address the challenge of maximizing individual payoff while preserving the common resource for future rounds, an optimal strategy must balance exploitation and conservation. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation-Conservation Balance

1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1 to 3):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Reasoning:** Establish a baseline, observe how the stock changes, and encourage others to cooperate by setting an example.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Round 4 onwards until Round r-1):**
   - **Assessment Criteria:**
     - **Stock Level:** Current stock level relative to capacity.
     - **Historical Cooperation Rate:** Percentage of players who Cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Decision Rules:**
     - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity AND more than 50% of players Cooperated last round:
         - **Action:** Defect to exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate gain.
       - Else if the current stock is below 50% of capacity OR fewer than 40% Cooperated last round:
         - **Action:** Cooperate to conserve the stock and encourage recovery.
       - Otherwise:
         - **Action:** Cooperate if the historical average suggests moderate depletion, else Defect cautiously.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect.
   - **Reasoning:** Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of others' behavior without immediate depletion.
- **Adaptive Decision Making:** Adjusts based on current stock levels and past behavior, balancing between exploiting when safe and conserving when necessary.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** Maximizes personal gain in the last round without concern for future sustainability.

This strategy dynamically adjusts to the state of the common resource and the actions of others, aiming to optimize individual payoff while considering the need to preserve the resource for future rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_267 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance immediate payoffs with long-term sustainability by adapting based on the stock level and the game's progression.

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a high initial stock, encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Middle Rounds:** 
  - If the current stock exceeds 50% of capacity, Cooperate to maintain the resource for future rounds.
  - If the stock drops below 50%, Defect to maximize immediate gains as others likely are exploiting.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect since there's no future benefit from preserving the stock.

### 2. Edge Cases:
- **First Round Handling:** Cooperate to establish a cooperative precedent.
- **Last Round Handling:** Defect to secure maximum payoff without regard for future rounds.
- **Stock Recovery:** If stock recovers above the threshold after defecting, revert to cooperating.

### 3. Exploitative Approach:
The strategy aligns with an exploitative mindset by using the stock level as a proxy for others' actions. It takes advantage of high stock levels through cooperation and defects when the stock is depleted, indicating widespread exploitation by other players.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def strategy(stock, round, capacity):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        if stock > threshold:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

This strategy adaptively responds to the stock level, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors while maximizing cumulative payoffs over all rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_268 = '''
To address the problem, we need to design a strategy that balances cooperation with defection to maximize payoffs while considering the dynamics of the common resource. The key is to maintain the stock at a healthy level unless it's nearing depletion, in which case maximizing immediate gain becomes more critical.

### Approach
The approach involves an adaptive strategy that starts with cooperation and switches to defection based on the current stock level relative to its capacity. Specifically:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate to start building trust and resource sustainability.
2. **Middle Rounds (2 to r-1):** 
   - If the stock is above 80% of its capacity, continue cooperating.
   - If the stock drops below this threshold, defect to maximize immediate gain as others might be over-exploiting.
3. **Last Round:** Always defect to ensure maximum personal payoff since there's no future growth after this round.

This strategy ensures that we maintain resource health while adapting when it's clear others are depleting it excessively or when the game nears its end.

### Solution Code
```python
def adaptive_reciprocity_strategy(round_num, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "COOPERATE"
    # Determine if we're in the last round
    if round_num == total_rounds:
        return "DEFECT"
    # Calculate threshold stock level (80% of capacity)
    threshold = 0.8 * capacity
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return "COOPERATE"
    else:
        return "DEFECT"
```

### Explanation
- **First Round:** We start by cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and resource sustainability.
- **Middle Rounds:** By checking the stock against an 80% threshold, we ensure that if others are depleting the resource too much, we switch strategies to protect our interests without overreacting to minor fluctuations.
- **Last Round:** Defecting ensures maximum personal gain as there's no future benefit from maintaining the stock beyond this point.

This approach is adaptive and balances long-term sustainability with immediate gains when necessary.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Begin with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and observe others' behavior without immediately exploiting.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Level Check:**
     - If the stock level after growth in the previous round is below half of the capacity, switch strategy.
   - **Opponent Behavior Assessment:**
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players in the last round. If less than 50% cooperated, defect in the current round.
   - **Defection Threshold:**
     - If the stock level drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), prioritize immediate gain by defecting.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** In the last round, maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences for overexploitation.

        if previous_stock < capacity * 0.5 or avg_cooperation < 0.5:

                # Check for stock level and defect if necessary
                if history[-1]['stock_after'] < capacity * 0.2:

# Example usage in a game round
n = 4
r = 10
capacity = 100
history = [...] # List of previous rounds' data

action = adaptive_exploitation_strategy(n, r, capacity, history)
print(action)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to gauge others' behavior.
- **Stock Level Monitoring:** Adjusts strategy based on the remaining stock, defecting if it's unsustainable.
- **Opponent Behavior Adaptation:** Uses past actions to decide whether to exploit or continue cooperating.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** Maximizes payoff in the last round by defecting.

This approach balances cooperation for sustainability with strategic defection to exploit others' behavior, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_270 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll employ a dynamic approach that adapts based on game history and current state. The strategy is designed to maximize payoffs by balancing cooperation and defection, ensuring long-term sustainability while exploiting opponents' behavior.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

#### 1. Decision Rules:

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to initiate with a conservative approach, preventing early stock depletion.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Calculate the average cooperation rate of all players from previous rounds.
    - If the average cooperation is high (>50%), defect more frequently (e.g., 60% defect, 40% cooperate) to exploit others' cooperation without causing rapid depletion.
    - If the average cooperation is low (<50%), increase cooperation (e.g., 70% cooperate, 30% defect) to sustain the stock and encourage regeneration.
  
- **Stock Monitoring:** Continuously track the current stock level. If it falls below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), shift towards cooperation (80%) to allow stock recovery.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

- **Last Round:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as future consequences are irrelevant.
  
- **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize cooperation to prevent depletion, ensuring some resource remains for subsequent rounds if applicable.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity, history=None):
    if history is None:
        # First round: Cooperate
        return 'C'
    
    avg_cooperation = sum(h == 'C' for h in history) / len(history)
    current_stock = get_current_stock()
    
    if current_stock < 0.25 * capacity or (get_round() == r):
        return 'D' if get_round() == r else 'C'
    
    if avg_cooperation > 0.5:
        # Exploit by defecting more
        return 'D' with probability 0.6, 'C' with 0.4
    else:
        # Cooperate to sustain stock
        return 'C' with probability 0.7, 'D' with 0.3

# Example usage in each round
action = adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity, history_of_actions)
```

### Explanation:

- **Adaptation:** The strategy adjusts based on opponents' past actions and current stock levels, exploiting cooperation while preventing resource exhaustion.
  
- **Exploitative Mindset:** By defecting when others cooperate more, the strategy captures higher payoffs. Conversely, it sustains cooperation to maintain resource availability for future rounds.

This approach ensures that the player dynamically responds to the game environment, maximizing total payoffs through strategic exploitation and prudent resource management.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_271 = '''
To address the problem effectively, we can outline an optimal strategy that balances cooperation with strategic exploitation, ensuring sustainable resource use while maximizing payoffs.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a high initial stock level and observe others' behavior.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (except last)**: 
   - If the current stock is below 30% of capacity, cooperate to allow recovery.
   - If others have cooperated more than 70% of the time and the stock is above 30%, defect to exploit their cooperation.
3. **Last Round**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Initial Cooperation**:
   - In the first round, every player chooses to Cooperate (C). This sets a high initial stock level and allows observation of others' actions without depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - For each round from 2 to r-1:
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players based on their past choices.
     - If the current stock (S) is below 30% of capacity, choose Cooperate to help replenish the stock for future rounds.
     - If S is above 30%, check others' average cooperation rate. If it exceeds 70%, choose Defect to exploit their higher cooperation. Otherwise, continue Cooperating.

3. **Final Round**:
   - In the last round (round r), every player chooses to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no subsequent rounds to affect.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Round 1**: All players C. Stock remains at capacity.
- **Round 2**: Others' cooperation rate is 100%. Since S=100% >30%, and others' average >70%, defect. If all defect, stock drops to zero.
- **Round 3**: S=0, so cooperate to attempt recovery (though no growth occurs).
- **Last Round (r)**: Always D for maximum immediate gain.

### Conclusion:

This strategy balances exploiting others' cooperation with preserving the resource for future use, ensuring that players maximize their payoffs while minimizing the risk of rapid depletion.

**Adaptive Exploitation Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate (C) to observe opponents' actions and initial stock dynamics.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Recent History:** Track opponents' past actions over the last m rounds, where m is a parameter (e.g., m=3).
   - **Calculate Cooperation Rate:** Determine the average cooperation rate of other players.
     - If ≥ 50%, Cooperate; else, Defect.
   - **Stock Level Check:** If stock falls below 20% of capacity, switch to Cooperate to allow recovery.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds don't matter.

4. **Parameter Considerations:**
   - Adjust cooperation rate threshold and stock level threshold based on game parameters.
   - Fine-tune m (number of recent rounds) for responsiveness without over-reacting.

5. **Robustness Measures:**
   - Use a moving average to smooth out noise in cooperation trends.
   - Incorporate feedback mechanisms to adjust strategy if stock shows consistent decline despite cooperation.

6. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - At capacity, prioritize exploitation as growth is limited.
   - When stock is low, balance between recovery (C) and exploiting (D).

This strategy aims to exploit others' cooperation while maintaining resource sustainability, adapting dynamically based on observed behaviors and stock conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_273 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' initial moves.
   - **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1):**
     1. Calculate the average number of defectors in previous rounds.
     2. Assess the current stock level relative to capacity.
     3. If the stock is below 50% of capacity or shows a decreasing trend, Cooperate (C) to help recover the stock.
     4. If the majority of players defected in the last round and the stock is above 50%, Defect (D) to exploit their actions while the stock can sustain it.
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future rounds to consider.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to gather initial data on others' behavior and maintain a healthy stock.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to ensure maximum personal gain without concern for future consequences.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
   The strategy is designed to balance exploitation with conservation. By cooperating when the stock is low, it helps sustain the resource for future rounds. When others defect and the stock is sufficient, defecting allows you to capitalize on their actions, maximizing your payoff while maintaining a robust approach against various opponent behaviors.

This adaptive strategy ensures that you respond effectively to both the game's state and the actions of other players, optimizing your total payoff over all rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_274 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in a repeated game where players can observe past actions and the stock level changes based on collective decisions, we propose a threshold-based strategy. This approach aims to balance cooperation with self-interest by maintaining cooperation as long as the stock remains healthy and switching to defection once it significantly depletes.

### Strategy: Threshold-Based Cooperation

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to contribute to a high initial stock level.
2. **Monitor Stock Level**: After each subsequent round, check if the current stock level has dropped below 50% of the game's capacity.
3. **Switch to Defection**: If the stock falls below this threshold, switch to defecting for all remaining rounds to maximize personal payoffs before the stock is depleted further.

This strategy ensures that you contribute to maintaining a healthy stock while protecting your own interests once the stock starts to deplete significantly.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_275 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Trends and Game Progress**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Begin with cooperation in the first round to encourage stock sustainability.
   - Track the history of stock levels (`stock_history`) starting from capacity.

2. **Stock Trend Analysis:**
   - For each subsequent round, calculate the current stock level (`S_t`).
   - Determine if the stock is increasing or decreasing by comparing `S_t` with the previous stock level (`S_{t-1}`).

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - If the current stock level is above 50% of capacity and the trend is stable or positive, cooperate (C).
   - If the stock level falls below 50% of capacity or shows a negative trend, switch to defecting (D).
   - In the last three rounds (`r-3` to `r`), always choose D to maximize immediate payoffs.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a high initial stock level.
   - **Last Three Rounds:** Always defect to secure higher payoffs as future sustainability is less critical.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock approaches zero, defect to capture any remaining resources.

5. **Implementation Pseudocode:**

```python
def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    # Check if in last three rounds
    if current_round >= total_rounds - 3:
        return "D"
    # Calculate trend based on previous stock levels
    trend = determine_trend(current_stock, stock_history)
    if current_stock > 0.5 * capacity and trend != 'decreasing':
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

def determine_trend(current_stock, stock_history):
    # Compare current with previous to establish trend direction
    previous_stock = stock_history[-1]
    if current_stock < previous_stock:
        return 'decreasing'
    else:
        return 'stable/increasing'

# Example usage in a round:
current_round = t
total_rounds = r
current_stock = S_t
capacity = given_capacity

action = decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity)
```

This strategy adaptively switches between cooperation and defection based on observed stock trends and the game's progression, aiming to balance immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_276 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C). This initial cooperative move helps establish a higher stock level for future rounds and encourages others to potentially cooperate as well.
   - **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
     - If the current stock level exceeds two-thirds (2/3) of the capacity, choose to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff while the resource is plentiful.
     - If the current stock is below or equal to two-thirds of the capacity, choose to Cooperate (C) to help replenish and sustain the resource for future exploitation.
   - **Last Round (Round r)**: Always Defect (D). Since there are no subsequent rounds, prioritize immediate gain without concern for depleting the stock.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - In scenarios where the stock is extremely low (near 0), the strategy automatically switches to Cooperate due to the threshold rule, preventing further depletion.
   - The first round's cooperation sets a conservative tone, potentially influencing others' behavior positively and maintaining a higher stock for future exploitation.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   This strategy capitalizes on high stock levels by defecting when it is safe to do so, thus exploiting the resource when sustainable. It adapts based on observable state changes rather than relying on opponents' strategies, ensuring robustness against various behaviors.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```python
def exploitative_strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, round_number, history):
    threshold = (2/3) * capacity
    
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

This strategy effectively balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring adaptability and robustness in a competitive environment.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_277 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D) in each round of the game while maximizing your total payoff over multiple rounds, we need a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the resource. The key is to avoid depleting the stock too quickly, which would reduce future payoffs.

### Strategy:
1. **Threshold-Based Approach**: 
   - Define a threshold \( T \) as 50% of the capacity.
   - If the current stock level \( S \) is above \( T \), choose to defect (D).
   - If \( S \) is below or equal to \( T \), choose to cooperate (C).

This strategy ensures that you take advantage of high stock levels by defecting, thus maximizing immediate payoffs, while cooperating when the stock is low to help sustain it for future rounds.

### Heuristic Rationale:
- **Defecting When Stock is High**: By defecting when \( S > 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \), you maximize your short-term gains without causing irreversible depletion of the stock, assuming others may also be defecting.
- **Cooperating When Stock is Low**: Cooperating helps maintain the stock at a level that allows for recovery through growth, ensuring that there are sufficient resources in future rounds.

### Example Walkthrough:
Assume \( \text{capacity} = 100 \) and \( n = 4 \).

- **Round 1**: \( S = 100 \). Since \( 100 > 50 \), defect. If everyone defects, total consumption is 100, leading to \( S_{\text{remaining}} = 0 \).
- **Round 2**: \( S = 0 \). You must cooperate because \( S \leq 50 \). However, with \( S = 0 \), no one can consume anything. This highlights the importance of strategic cooperation to prevent stock depletion.
- **Subsequent Rounds**: If in Round 1 not everyone defected, say 3 defected and 1 cooperated, total consumption would be \( 3 \times 25 + 12.5 = 87.5 \), leaving \( S_{\text{remaining}} = 12.5 \). Growth would then be calculated as \( 2 \times 12.5 \times (1 - 12.5/100) = 23.4375 \), making the new stock \( 35.9375 \).

### Conclusion:
The threshold-based strategy provides a balanced approach to maximize immediate gains while preserving the resource for future rounds, ensuring a more sustainable total payoff over the game's duration.

**Final Answer:**

Use a threshold of 50% of the capacity. Cooperate if the current stock is below this level and defect otherwise. Thus, your strategy is:

- If \( S > 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \), choose to defect (D).
- Otherwise, cooperate (C).

This approach balances maximizing immediate payoffs with sustaining the resource for future rounds.

\boxed{\text{Cooperate if } S \leq 0.5 \times \text{capacity; otherwise, Defect}}
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_278 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts to both the game state and opponents' behaviors, we can outline the following approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Conservation (ACSC)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' initial moves.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.
  - **Stock Level Check:** If the current stock is below 25% of capacity, Cooperate to allow stock regeneration.
  - **Opponent Behavior Analysis:** Calculate the average cooperation rate over the last few rounds (e.g., previous 3 rounds). If the majority (average >= 50%) have been Cooperating, continue Cooperating. Otherwise, Defect.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **Low Stock:** When stock is critically low (below 25% of capacity), prioritize conservation by Cooperating to facilitate recovery.
- **End Game:** In the final round, defect to maximize immediate gains since there's no future impact on the stock.
- **Initial Rounds:** Start with cooperation to encourage a cooperative environment and gather initial data on opponents' tendencies.

#### 3. Exploitative Approach:
The strategy aligns with an exploitative mindset by capitalizing on others' cooperation while avoiding being exploited. By switching to Defect when others defect, it prevents being a "sucker" and maximizes individual payoffs. The adaptive nature ensures responsiveness to both stock dynamics and collective player behavior.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, total_rounds, history):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round_num == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        # Check stock level
        if current_stock < 0.25 * capacity:
            return "C"
        # Calculate average cooperation rate over last k rounds (e.g., k=3)
        k = min(round_num - 1, 3)  # Use up to previous 3 rounds
        total_coop = sum([h.count("C") for h in history[-k:]]) if history else 0
        avg_coop_rate = total_coop / (n * k)
        if avg_coop_rate >= 0.5:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins by Cooperating to foster a cooperative environment and gauge other players' strategies.
- **Stock Conservation:** If the stock is critically low, it switches to Cooperation to allow regeneration, ensuring long-term sustainability.
- **Adaptive Behavior:** By monitoring recent cooperation rates, the strategy adapts to exploit others' cooperative tendencies or defect when exploitation is prevalent.
- **End Game Defection:** Maximizes immediate payoff in the final round without concern for future stock levels.

This strategy balances cooperation and defection dynamically, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors while aiming to maximize individual payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_279 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, I've developed a structured approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize payoffs while considering the dynamic state of the stock. Here's the final strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Conservation (AES)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a high initial stock and encourage others to cooperate.
- **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):** 
  - Calculate the average defection rate of all players from previous rounds.
  - If this rate exceeds 50% or if the current stock is below half of capacity, choose Defect (D).
  - Otherwise, Cooperate (C) to maintain a sustainable stock level.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without future consequences.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to build trust and a robust stock.
- **Last Round:** Prioritize immediate gain by defecting, as there's no subsequent round to penalize this action.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to defection if the stock falls below half capacity to prevent depletion and secure remaining resources.

#### 3. Exploitative Approach:
The strategy is designed to exploit others' behavior by adapting based on their past actions and the current state of the stock. It punishes excessive defection by switching strategies to protect one's own payoff while conserving the resource when cooperation is feasible.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(n, r, capacity):
    total_defects = 0
    previous_stock = capacity

    for round in range(1, r+1):
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        elif round == r:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            # Calculate average defection rate from previous rounds
            avg_defection_rate = total_defects / (n * (round - 1))
            
            # Check if stock is below half capacity or if defection rate exceeds threshold
            if current_stock < (capacity / 2) or avg_defection_rate > 0.5:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'

        # Execute the action and observe outcomes after all players act
        #假设在这里可以观察到其他玩家的行为和当前的库存水平
        current_stock_after = ... #根据游戏规则计算新的库存

        # Update total_defects based on number of Ds in this round
        num_defectors = count_defections()
        total_defects += num_defectors

        previous_stock = current_stock_after

    return action
```

### Explanation:
This strategy starts cooperatively to foster a healthy stock level. It monitors others' actions and the stock's health, adapting by defecting when others exploit excessively or when the stock is at risk. By defecting in the last round, it ensures maximum gain without future repercussions. This approach balances exploitation with conservation, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_280 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** Begin by cooperating to establish a cooperative tone and observe others' initial behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Majority Rule:** Track the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than half defected, choose to Defect (D) in the current round.
   - **Payoff Evaluation:** Maintain a moving average of your payoffs from the last three rounds for both Cooperate and Defect actions. If the average payoff from defecting is higher, continue defecting; otherwise, switch to cooperating.
   - **Stock Level Consideration:** Monitor the stock level. If it drops below half of the capacity (capacity/2), temporarily switch to Cooperate for one round to allow stock recovery.

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - **Defect (D):** In the final round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

4. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If the stock is at capacity, continue with the current strategy but prefer Cooperate if sustainable.
   - If the stock is near zero, Defect to capture remaining resources, as conservation is no longer beneficial.

5. **Adaptive Adjustments:**
   - Continuously update your strategy based on the evolving game state and opponents' behaviors. Balance between exploiting current benefits and conserving for future rounds by dynamically adjusting actions according to observed cooperation levels and stock dynamics.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive, responsive to both the game's state and others' actions, ensuring a balance between exploitation and conservation to maximize total payoff over all rounds.

To design an effective and exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on maximizing immediate payoffs while ensuring long-term sustainability of the resource. The strategy adapts based on the current stock level and the round number.

### Strategy: Exploitative Stock Conservation (ESC)

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to maintain a high initial stock level and observe other players' actions.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - If it's the last round, always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.
   - If the current stock is below 30% of capacity, Cooperate (C) to allow stock recovery, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.
   - Otherwise, Defect (D) to exploit the resource for higher payoffs while the stock is sufficient.

    r = game_state['r']
    current_round = game_state['current_round']

            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
```

### Explanation

- **First Round Cooperation**: By cooperating in the first round, we set a high initial stock level and gather information on other players' tendencies.
- **Last Round Exploitation**: On the final round, there's no future to preserve, so defecting maximizes immediate gain.
- **Stock Threshold Conservation**: When the stock falls below 30% of capacity, cooperation helps replenish it for continued exploitation in subsequent rounds.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term resource sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.

**Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, cooperate (C) to encourage others to do the same and build a strong stock level.
- **Stock Level Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
  - If the stock is above a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), continue cooperating to maintain sustainability.
  - If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to defecting (D) to maximize immediate gains.
- **Trend Analysis**: Track the trend of stock changes over recent rounds. If the stock is decreasing rapidly, shift towards defecting more frequently.
- **Endgame Strategy**: As the game nears its end (last few rounds), gradually increase defection to prioritize immediate payoffs since future consequences are irrelevant.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
- Adapt behavior based on observed trends in stock levels and opponent actions, balancing cooperation for sustainability with strategic defection to exploit others' cooperation.

This strategy aims to balance long-term sustainability with opportunistic exploitation, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_283 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we can create a comprehensive approach that balances exploitation with sustainability. The strategy should adapt based on the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability (AES)

#### 1. Decision Rules:

- **Initial Rounds (First few rounds):**
  - **Cooperate (C):** Start by cooperating to observe others' behavior and maintain a high stock level early on, which can be exploited later.
  
- **Middle Rounds:**
  - **Responsive Cooperation:** If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity), cooperate. This helps sustain the resource for future exploitation.
  - **Defection Threshold:** If the stock drops below this threshold, switch to defecting to maximize short-term gains before the stock depletes further.

- **Late Rounds:**
  - **Opportunistic Defection:** As the game nears its end, increase defection to exploit any remaining resources, knowing that future rounds are limited.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' initial moves without immediately depleting the stock.
  
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future round to preserve the stock for.

- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock is critically low, defect to ensure you get as much as possible before it's depleted.

#### 3. Exploitative Approach:

- **Monitor and Adapt:** Continuously observe other players' actions. If many are cooperating, maintain cooperation to sustain the stock. If many are defecting, switch to defecting to avoid being exploited.
  
- **Threshold-Based Actions:** Use predefined thresholds for stock levels to determine when to shift strategies, ensuring both sustainability and exploitation opportunities.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategyParameters(n, r, capacity):

        current_stock = get_current_stock()

action = adaptive_exploitation_strategyParameters(n=4, r=10, capacity=100)
print(action)  # Output: 'C' or 'D' based on conditions
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, the strategy sets a high stock level, allowing for potential future exploitation.
  
- **Responsive Strategy:** The strategy adapts based on stock levels and opponents' actions, ensuring that it doesn't overly deplete the resource but takes advantage when others defect.
  
- **Thresholds:** Using specific thresholds (like 70% and 30% of capacity) helps in making clear decisions on when to switch strategies, balancing sustainability with exploitation.

This approach ensures that the player can exploit others' actions while maintaining the stock at a level that allows for continued play, maximizing overall payoff across all rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_284 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy must adapt based on the current stock level and past trends to ensure robustness against various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Trends

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to start, allowing observation of initial stock dynamics.
   - **Subsequent Rounds (until last round):** 
     - If the current stock level is below 80% of the game's capacity, switch to cooperation to conserve resources and allow regrowth.
     - If the stock is above this threshold, defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs while the resource is plentiful.
   - **Last Round:** Always defect to secure maximum possible payoff in the final round, as there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round Handling:** Initial cooperation sets a baseline for observing how the stock changes after the first consumption and regrowth phase.
   - **Last Round Handling:** Defecting ensures the maximum possible extraction in the final round, optimizing immediate gain without future repercussions.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - The strategy is designed to exploit high stock levels by defecting when resources are abundant, ensuring higher payoffs while maintaining sustainability by switching to cooperation when resources are scarce.
   - By monitoring the stock level and adjusting actions based on a threshold, the strategy adapts dynamically to prevent depletion while maximizing gains.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def common_pool_strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return "C"
    elif len(history) == r - 1:  # Last round
        return "D"
    else:
        current_stock = history[-1]
        threshold = 0.8 * capacity
        if current_stock < threshold:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"

# Example usage within the game loop:
history = [capacity]  # Initial stock is at capacity
for round in range(r):
    action = common_pool_strategy(n, r, capacity, history)
    # Simulate the round based on all players' actions and update history
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, the strategy begins conservatively, allowing the stock to demonstrate its resilience.
- **Adaptive Thresholding:** The 80% threshold serves as a trigger to switch strategies. When the stock drops below this level, cooperation is favored to allow recovery.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** In the last round, defecting ensures that the player captures the maximum possible payoff without concern for future depletion.

This approach ensures that the strategy remains robust against various opponent behaviors by dynamically adjusting based on observed stock levels and trends.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_285 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline and encourage initial stock conservation.

2. **Monitor Stock Trends:**
   - Track the stock level after each round. If the stock falls below 70% of capacity, switch to defecting more frequently to prevent further depletion and secure higher payoffs.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - After the first round, analyze opponents' actions. If a significant number defected, consider defecting in subsequent rounds to protect your payoff.

4. **Stock Conservation Threshold:**
   - Implement a threshold where if the stock drops below 70% of capacity, increase defection rate to safeguard against rapid depletion.

5. **Final Round Strategy:**
   - Defect in the last round to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

This strategy balances initial cooperation with adaptive decision-making, ensuring long-term payoffs by conserving resources while protecting against exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_286 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D) in a repeated game with perfect information, we need a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the resource. The goal is to maximize one's own payoff while considering the actions of others and the health of the stock.

### Approach
The strategy combines elements of cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and stock trends:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to set a cooperative tone and maintain a high initial stock level.
2. **Final Round Defection**: Always defect in the last round since there is no future benefit from maintaining cooperation beyond that point.
3. **Behavioral Adaptation**: For intermediate rounds, observe the number of defections in the previous round. If more than half of the players defected, switch to defection to avoid being exploited. Additionally, if the stock level decreased in the previous round, defect to maximize immediate gains before potential depletion.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(n, t, r, stock_history, prev_actions):

    - r: Total number of rounds
    - stock_history: List of stock levels after each round, indexed by round number (0 for initial, 1 for after first round, etc.)
    - prev_actions: List of actions taken by all players in previous rounds. Each element is a list where each player's action is 'C' or 'D'.
    
    Returns:
    - action: 'C' or 'D' for the current round.
    """
    
    if t == 1:
        # First round: Cooperate
        return 'C'
    elif t == r:
        # Last round: Defect
        return 'D'
    else:
        # For rounds 2 to r-1
        prev_round = t - 1
        
        # Count number of defectors in the previous round
        if len(prev_actions) >= prev_round:
            defectors_last_round = sum(1 for action_list in prev_actions[prev_round - 1] if action_list == 'D')
        else:
            # Not enough data, assume cooperation
            defectors_last_round = 0
        
        # Check if more than half defected last round
        if defectors_last_round > n / 2:
            return 'D'
        
        # Check stock trend: whether it decreased in the previous round
        # Stock history is after each round, index 0 is initial before any rounds
        if len(stock_history) >= t + 1:
            current_stock = stock_history[t]
            prev_stock = stock_history[t - 1]
        else:
            # Assume no decrease if stock data isn't available
            return 'C'
        
        if current_stock < prev_stock:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: By cooperating in the first round, we aim to maintain a high stock level and encourage others to reciprocate.
- **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, there's no incentive to cooperate since future consequences are irrelevant.
- **Behavioral Adaptation**: For intermediate rounds, we monitor defections. If many players defected previously or if the stock decreased, we defect to avoid being exploited and maximize our payoff before potential depletion.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observed behavior and resource health, aiming to optimize personal gain while considering the dynamics of the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_287 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that maximizes individual payoff while considering both current stock levels and opponents' historical behavior. The strategy must adapt to changing conditions and exploit opportunities when possible.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Conservation (AEC)

**Objective**: Maximize total payoff over all rounds by exploiting others' cooperation while conserving the stock for future rounds.

#### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**:
   - Cooperate (C) to observe opponents' initial behavior and maintain a high starting stock.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (t = 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Monitor Stock Level**: If the current stock (S) is below 50% of capacity, cooperate to allow recovery.
   - **Assess Opponent Behavior**: Calculate the average defection rate (D_avg) from previous rounds.
     - If D_avg exceeds 50%, defect to exploit opponents' tendency towards cooperation or prevent being exploited.
     - Otherwise, choose to defect with a probability equal to D_avg; cooperate otherwise.

3. **Last Round (t = r)**:
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

#### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Low Stock**: When S < 50% of capacity, prioritize cooperation to prevent depletion and allow growth.
- **High Opponent Defection**: If historical defection rates are high, defect more frequently to capture larger payoffs before the stock diminishes significantly.
- **Last Round Exploitation**: In the final round, defect to ensure maximum immediate gain, as there are no subsequent rounds to consider.

#### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Observing initial behavior helps gauge opponents' strategies without immediately signaling exploitation.
- **Stock Conservation**: Cooperating when stock is low ensures future payoffs by preventing depletion.
- **Adaptive Defection**: Adjusting defection rates based on historical behavior allows strategic exploitation while minimizing risks of retaliation or stock collapse.
- **Final Round Maximization**: Defecting in the last round captures maximum value without future repercussions.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to both environmental and competitive factors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_288 = '''
To address the problem of managing a common resource game where each player can choose to cooperate or defect, with the goal of maximizing personal payoff while considering the sustainability of the resource, I propose the following structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a cooperative tone and gather initial information on others' behavior.
2. **Subsequent Rounds (from 2 to r-1)**:
   - If the stock level after the previous round is below 50% of capacity, cooperate to help replenish the resource.
   - Otherwise, evaluate the cooperation rate of other players from the previous round:
     - If ≥75% cooperated, defect to exploit their cooperation.
     - If ≤25%, defect as others are likely maximizing their payoffs at the expense of the resource.
     - If between 26% and 74%, cooperate if more than half cooperated; otherwise, defect.
3. **Last Round (round r)**: Always defect to maximize final payoff, as there is no future round to consider.

### Strategy Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation encourages others to reciprocate and helps in building a sustainable resource base early on.
- **Stock Level Consideration**: Cooperating when the stock is low ensures that the resource can recover, preventing premature depletion and maintaining long-term viability.
- **Exploitation of Others' Cooperation**: Defecting when most others are cooperating allows for personal gain without significantly harming the resource's sustainability.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: By adjusting behavior based on others' past actions, the strategy remains flexible and responsive to dynamic game conditions.
- **Maximizing Final Payoff**: Defecting in the last round ensures that no potential gain is left on the table since there are no future consequences.

This approach balances between preserving the resource for sustained use and strategically defecting when it is personally beneficial, considering both the current state of the resource and others' behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_289 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we'll create an adaptive approach that balances cooperation with exploitation based on observed behavior and current stock levels. The strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while considering the sustainability of the shared resource.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Recent Behavior and Stock Levels

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' actions.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Calculate the proportion of players who defected in the previous round, denoted as D.
  - If D exceeds 30% or the current stock level drops below 50% of capacity, choose Defect (D).
  - Otherwise, Cooperate (C).

- **Endgame Strategy:** In the last 20% of rounds, always choose Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future depletion.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to initiate trust and gather initial data on others' behavior.
  
- **Last Rounds:** Prioritize immediate gains by defecting in the final stages of the game, as future stock replenishment becomes less relevant.

- **Low Stock Levels:** When the stock is critically low (below 50% of capacity), defect to secure available resources before depletion accelerates.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**

This strategy exploits opponents' behavior by defecting when cooperation is insufficient or when the resource is under threat, ensuring maximum personal gain while adapting to the dynamic game state.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1

    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"

    # Calculate proportion of defectors in previous round
    prev_actions = history[-1]
    defectors_prev = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
    D = defectors_prev / n

    # Current stock state (needs to be tracked)
    S_current = get_current_stock()

    # Determine if in endgame rounds
    endgame_threshold = 0.2 * r
    is_endgame = current_round > (r - endgame_threshold)

    if D > 0.3 or S_current < 0.5 * capacity or is_endgame:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to encourage others and gather initial data.
  
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Adjusts actions based on recent defection rates and stock levels, balancing between sustaining the resource and exploiting others' greed.

- **Endgame Focus:** Shifts strategy in final rounds to prioritize immediate gains, reflecting the diminishing importance of long-term sustainability as the game concludes.

This approach ensures robustness against various opponent behaviors while maximizing individual payoffs through strategic exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_290 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (Rounds 1-3):**
   - Cooperate in the first three rounds to observe other players' behavior without depleting the stock rapidly.

2. **Monitor and Adapt:**
   - After the initial period, monitor the stock level and the number of defectors each round.
   - If the stock falls below 50% of capacity or more than half of the players defect, switch strategy to defecting.

3. **Defect Mode:**
   - Once in defect mode, continue unless the stock recovers above 50% with fewer defectors, indicating a potential return to cooperation.

4. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - In the final round, always choose to defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

This strategy balances observation, adaptation, and exploitation, aiming to optimize payoffs while responding dynamically to game state changes.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_291 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed a nuanced approach that balances exploitation with sustainability. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Sustainability (AESS)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Initial Round**: Cooperate to observe others' behavior and foster initial stock growth.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - **Monitor Previous Round**: Track the number of players who Defected in the last round.
  - **Stock Level Check**: Assess the current stock level relative to capacity.
  - **Thresholds**:
    - If more than 50% of players Defected and/or the stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), Cooperate to sustain the resource.
    - Otherwise, Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **Last Round**: Always Defect to maximize final round payoff, as there's no future impact.
- **Extremely Low Stock**: If stock is near depletion (e.g., below 10% of capacity), Cooperate to allow recovery, even if others Defect.

#### 3. Exploitative Approach:
- The strategy exploits others' cooperation by defecting when the stock is healthy enough, while ensuring sustainability by cooperating when necessary to prevent depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def aess_strategy(params, state, history):
    n = params['n']
    r = params['rounds']
    capacity = params['capacity']
    current_stock = state['stock']
    round_num = state['round']

    if round_num == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    prev_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
    
    # Critical thresholds
    defect_threshold = n * 0.5  # If more than half defected last round
    stock_critical = capacity * 0.3  # Stock is critically low
    
    if (num_defectors > defect_threshold or current_stock < stock_critical) and round_num != r:
        return 'C'
    elif round_num == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Example usage
params = {'n': 4, 'rounds': 10, 'capacity': 100}
state_round_2 = {'stock': 75, 'round': 2}
history = [{'actions': ['C', 'D', 'C', 'D']}]

action = aess_strategy(params, state_round_2, history)
print(action)  # Output: 'D'
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with Cooperate to gauge others' strategies and build stock.
- **Adaptive Decision Making**: Uses recent history to decide actions, ensuring the strategy is responsive to collective behavior.
- **Stock Sustainability**: Prevents over-depletion by cooperating when stock levels are critically low or when a significant number of players defect.

This approach ensures that while we exploit opportunities for higher payoffs, we also maintain the resource's sustainability for future rounds, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_292 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance cooperation and defection in a way that maximizes immediate payoffs while maintaining the sustainability of the stock for future rounds. The strategy should adapt based on the observed behavior of other players and the current state of the stock.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Management (AESM)

#### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish an initial cooperative baseline and observe others' actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Cooperation Rate:** Calculate the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
     - If more than 75% of players cooperated, continue to Cooperate this round.
     - If fewer than 50% of players cooperated, switch to Defecting this round as a punitive measure.
   - **Stock Level Consideration:** After each round, check the stock level after growth. If it falls below half of the capacity (capacity / 2), switch to Cooperating in the next round to allow replenishment.

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Always Defect in the final round (round r) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of others' strategies.
- **Adaptive Response:** By adjusting based on the previous round's cooperation rate, the strategy rewards sustained cooperation and punishes defection, encouraging others to maintain cooperative behavior.
- **Stock Management:** Monitoring and responding to the stock level ensures that the resource isn't over-depleted, maintaining its sustainability for future exploitation.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** Defecting in the last round captures maximum immediate benefit since there are no subsequent rounds to consider.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(
    current_round: int,
    total_rounds: int,
    previous_actions: list[list[str]],
    stock_history: list[float],
    capacity: float
) -> str:
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    
    last_round_cooperations = sum(1 for action in previous_actions[-1] if action == 'C')
    cooperation_rate = last_round_cooperations / len(previous_actions[-1])
    
    if cooperation_rate > 0.75:
        current_action = "C"
    elif cooperation_rate < 0.5:
        current_action = "D"
    else:
        # Check stock level after last round's growth
        last_stock = stock_history[-1]
        if last_stock < (capacity / 2):
            current_action = "C"
        else:
            current_action = "D"
    
    if current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"  # Defect in the last round
    
    return current_action
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Round:** The strategy begins by cooperating to set a cooperative precedent.
- **Cooperation Rate Monitoring:** In subsequent rounds, it checks how many players cooperated previously. High cooperation is rewarded with continued cooperation, while low cooperation triggers defection as punishment.
- **Stock Level Management:** If the stock drops below half capacity, the strategy shifts to cooperation to facilitate recovery, ensuring future exploitation remains viable.
- **Final Round Defection:** In the last round, it defects to maximize immediate gain without concern for sustainability.

This approach balances punishment and maintenance of resources, aiming to exploit others' cooperative behavior while safeguarding against over-depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_293 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a dynamic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term stock preservation. The strategy adapts based on opponents' past actions and the current state of the stock.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation Strategy (AES)

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage others to do the same and build a baseline for future decisions.

2. **Tracking Mechanism:**
   - Monitor each opponent's actions across previous rounds, maintaining a count of their Cooperate (C) and Defect (D) choices.
   - Calculate an average cooperation rate among all opponents after each round.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **If the majority (>50%) of opponents cooperated in the last round:** Exploit by defecting to maximize immediate payoff, as others' cooperation sustains the stock.
   - **If a significant minority (30-50%) defected:** Continue cooperating to prevent rapid stock depletion but monitor closely for further defections.
   - **If the majority defected:** Switch to defecting to avoid being exploited, focusing on maximizing current gains.

4. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - **Low Stock (Below 25% of capacity):** Cooperate to help replenish the stock, ensuring future rounds have resources.
   - **Moderate Stock (25-75%):** Use the majority rule based on opponents' actions.
   - **High Stock (Above 75%):** Defect to exploit the abundant resource.

5. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - In the last round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

6. **Adaptive Learning:**
   - Continuously update opponent cooperation rates and adjust strategy dynamically.
   - Incorporate a forgiveness mechanism where if opponents revert to cooperating after periods of defection, consider shifting back towards cooperation.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python

                if coop_rate > 0.5:
                    action = 'D'  # Exploit cooperation
                elif coop_rate < 0.3:

                else:
                    action = 'C'

        # Execute action and calculate payoff
        if action == 'C':
            payoff = stock / (2 * n)
        else:
            payoff = stock / n

        total_payoff += payoff

        # Update opponent actions (assuming observation of all actions)
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            opponent_actions[i].append(get_opponent_action(i))

        for player in range(n):
            if get_player_action(player) == 'C':
                total_consumption += stock / (2 * n)
            else:
                total_consumption += stock / n

        S_remaining = max(0, stock - total_consumption)
        growth = 2 * S_remaining * (1 - S_remaining / capacity)
        new_stock = min(S_remaining + growth, capacity)

        # Prepare for next round
        stock = new_stock

    return total_payoff
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to set a positive tone and gather initial data on opponents' behaviors.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Adjusts strategy based on observed cooperation rates and current stock levels, ensuring it doesn't overly exploit or conserve unnecessarily.
- **Stock Thresholds:** Uses predefined thresholds to balance exploitation and conservation, ensuring sustainability for future rounds.
- **Final Round Maximization:** In the last round, defects to secure maximum immediate payoff without concern for future stock.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff by adapting actions based on opponents' behavior and stock dynamics.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a high stock level, promoting sustainability for future rounds.
   
2. **Monitoring Phase:**
   - Track the number of players defecting each round.
   - Calculate the stock trend by observing if the stock is consistently decreasing.

3. **Adaptive Response:**
   - If the number of defectors exceeds 50% in recent rounds, or if the stock level shows a downward trend (e.g., dropping below 80% of capacity), switch to Defecting (D).
   
4. **Late Game Strategy:**
   - In the last 10% of rounds, prioritize Defecting (D) as future consequences are minimal.
   - If the stock is very low (e.g., below a critical threshold like 20%), always Defect to maximize immediate gains.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to set a positive tone and build initial stock.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without future repercussions.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is critically low, switch to Defecting to capture remaining resources before depletion.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```
Initialize:
    history = []  # To keep track of previous actions and stock levels
    cooperate_threshold = 0.5  # Threshold for number of defectors
    stock_depletion_threshold = 0.8  # Stock level below which to consider depletion

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round:
        action = C
    else if it's one of the last few rounds (e.g., last 10%):
        action = D
    else:
        count_defectors = number of players who defected in previous round
        stock_trend = calculate trend from history

        if count_defectors > cooperate_threshold or stock_trend is decreasing below depletion threshold:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C

    record action and update history
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to build a robust stock level for future sustainability.
- **Adaptive Monitoring:** Tracks opponents' actions and stock trends, adapting strategy to exploit when others defect excessively or when the stock is depleting.
- **Late Game Exploitation:** Shifts towards defection in later rounds to maximize immediate payoffs as future rounds become less significant.

This strategy balances cooperation for long-term sustainability with strategic defection to exploit opponents' actions, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_295 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I've developed a structured approach that adapts based on previous actions and current stock levels. Here's the strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Conservation (AECS)

1. **First Round Action**: 
   - Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation sets a baseline of sustainability and observes others' behaviors without immediate exploitation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t < r)**:
   - **Assess Previous Defection Rate**: Calculate the number of defectors in the previous round, denoted as D_prev.
     - If D_prev exceeds 30% of total players (D_prev/n > 0.3), choose to Defect (D) in the current round.
   - **Stock Level Check**: If the stock after the previous round is below 50% of capacity, switch to Cooperate (C) to facilitate stock replenishment.
   - **Default Cooperation**: If neither condition above is met, continue with Cooperate (C).

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Always Defect (D). In the final round, maximize immediate payoff without concern for future sustainability.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts the game sustainably and provides a benchmark to assess others' strategies.
- **Adaptive Defection Threshold**: Reacts to high defection rates by joining in, preventing being exploited while maintaining stock if possible.
- **Stock Conservation Mechanism**: Ensures that when the stock is depleted beyond a critical point, cooperation resumes to allow recovery, safeguarding future payoffs.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Maximizes immediate gain in the last round, as there are no subsequent rounds to consider.

This strategy balances exploitation with conservation, adapting dynamically to group behavior and resource levels to optimize total payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_296 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitative Approach for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to encourage initial cooperation among players.
   
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - Track the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, choose to Defect (D).
     - Additionally, if the stock level drops below 25% of capacity, switch to Defect regardless of others' actions.
   
   - **Endgame Strategy:** In the last three rounds, lean towards defecting to maximize immediate payoffs, as future consequences are limited.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and encourage others to follow suit.
   - **Last Few Rounds (last 3 rounds):** Increase the tendency to Defect to maximize current payoffs since the game's end reduces future impacts on the stock.
   
3. **Adaptive Mechanism:**
   - Continuously monitor both the number of defections in previous rounds and the current stock level.
   - If the stock is below a critical threshold (25% of capacity), prioritize defecting to secure immediate gains, assuming others are likely to deplete the stock further.

4. **Exploitative Mindset:**
   - The strategy exploits cooperation when possible by reciprocating cooperative behavior but quickly adapts to defecting when others do not cooperate or when the stock is at risk of depletion.
   - By responding to defections and low stock levels, the strategy balances preserving the resource with maximizing individual payoffs.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def decide_action(round_number, previous_actions, current_stock, capacity, n):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"
    
    defect_count = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == "D")
    stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    
    if defect_count > n / 2 or current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return "D"
    elif round_number > (total_rounds - 3):
        # In last three rounds, defect more
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"
```

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, adjusting based on the behavior of other players and the state of the common pool resource. It aims to exploit cooperative scenarios while protecting against excessive depletion through strategic defection when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_297 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' initial behavior without immediately appearing as a defector.

   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     1. **Monitor Others' Actions:** Track the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     2. **Majority Behavior Check:** 
        - If more than half of the players defected in the last round, choose to Defect (D) to maximize your current payoff before potential stock depletion.
        - If half or fewer defected, Cooperate (C) to maintain a sustainable stock level for future rounds.
     3. **Stock Level Check:** 
        - If the stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to Cooperate (C) to help recover the stock, regardless of others' actions.

   - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future stock levels are no longer a concern.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and gather initial data on others' strategies.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to secure the highest possible payoff without regard for future rounds.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** When stock is critically low, prioritize recovery by cooperating, even if it means short-term losses.

**3. Exploitative Mindset:**
   - The strategy aims to exploit others' behavior by adjusting actions based on their previous choices and the current state of the stock.
   - By switching to Defect when many others are defecting, the strategy prevents being exploited while still considering the need for resource conservation.

**4. Robustness and Adaptability:**
   - The approach is robust against various opponent behaviors by adapting based on observed actions and stock dynamics.
   - It balances between exploiting current opportunities and maintaining resource sustainability for future gains.

This strategy ensures that you are not a consistent exploiter nor an easy target, adapting dynamically to the game's progression while considering both immediate gains and long-term resource health.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_298 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource game effectively, we've developed a strategic approach that balances exploiting opponents' cooperation with maintaining stock levels for sustained benefits. Here's how the strategy is structured:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to set a cooperative tone and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - **Mirror Strategy**: If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, switch to defecting to avoid being exploited.
   - **Stock Preservation**: If the stock drops below 25% of capacity, cooperate to help replenish it for future rounds.
   - **Final Round Maximization**: In the last round, defect to maximize immediate gain since there are no subsequent rounds to preserve the stock for.

### Pseudocode Representation:
```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity):
    # Initialize variables
    history = []
    for round in 1 to r:
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            previous_actions = history[-1]
            D_count = sum(1 for a in previous_actions if a == 'D')
            
            if D_count > n/2 or stock < 0.25 * capacity:
                action = 'D'
            elif round == r:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'
        # Record action and update history
        history.append(action)
```

### Strategy Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperating in the first round encourages a cooperative environment, which can lead to higher sustained payoffs.
- **Mirror Strategy**: By defecting when others do, you avoid being a sucker and maximize your payoff in that round.
- **Stock Preservation**: Cooperating when the stock is low ensures resource availability for future exploitation, preventing depletion that could harm long-term gains.
- **Final Round Maximization**: Defecting in the last round ensures you get the highest possible immediate payoff without worrying about future consequences.

This strategy is designed to be robust and exploitative, adjusting based on opponents' actions and stock levels to maximize total payoff over all rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_299 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I present a structured approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability while adapting to opponents' behaviors.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in CPR Game

1. **Initial Rounds (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by observing others' behavior without depleting the stock, encouraging initial cooperation and setting a baseline for future decisions.

2. **Ongoing Strategy:**
   - **Monitor Cooperation Rate:** Track the percentage of players who Cooperated in previous rounds.
     - If ≥75% Cooperated: Continue Cooperating to maintain stock health.
     - If <75% Cooperated: Switch to Defecting to protect against exploitation and maximize personal gain.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - **Low Stock (Below 50% of Capacity):** Cooperate to allow regrowth and prevent over-depletion.
   - **Moderate to High Stock:** Use the cooperation rate to decide, leaning towards Defection if others are not cooperating sufficiently.

4. **Final Round Strategy:**
   - If stock is above a threshold (e.g., 50% capacity): Cooperate to maintain a positive ending and potential influence on others' strategies.
   - If stock is below the threshold: Defect to maximize immediate gain, as future rounds don't exist.

5. **Regrowth and Sustainability:**
   - After significant consumption, prioritize Cooperation for a few rounds to facilitate stock recovery and ensure future payoffs.

6. **Adaptive Responses:**
   - If opponents start defecting after a cooperative period, shift towards Defection to avoid being exploited.
   - Periodically test opponents' reactions by defecting even when others are cooperating, using randomness to avoid predictability.

7. **Number of Players Consideration:**
   - With more players (larger n), exercise caution to prevent overexploitation, potentially increasing cooperation to sustain the stock.

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def cpr_strategy(game_state):
    if game_state['round'] == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate proportion of cooperators in previous round
    prev_coops = sum(1 for action in game_state['prev_actions'] if action == 'C')
    coop_rate = prev_coops / game_state['n']
    
    if coop_rate >= 0.75 and game_state['stock'] > 0.5 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    elif game_state['stock'] < 0.5 * capacity:
        return 'C'  # Recover stock
    else:
        # Consider defecting, especially if others are not cooperating enough
        return 'D'

# Last round handling
if current_round == total_rounds:
    if stock > 0.5 * capacity:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

# Periodic testing with randomness (e.g., 10% chance to defect even when others cooperate)
if random.random() < 0.1:
    return 'D'
```

### Conclusion

This strategy dynamically adjusts based on the stock level, opponents' cooperation rates, and the game's progress. It seeks to exploit others' behaviors without undermining the resource's sustainability, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term payoffs.

To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I present a structured approach that adapts to the game's dynamics while maximizing payoffs. The strategy balances immediate gains with future sustainability by monitoring and responding to the common pool's health.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Health

1. **First Round Action**:
   - **Defect (D)**: Start by defecting in the first round to maximize initial payoff since the stock is at full capacity, allowing for higher immediate gains without significant risk of depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Stock Levels**: Track the current stock level and its trend over recent rounds.
   - **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
     - **Stock Above 75% of Capacity**: Continue to defect (D). This threshold indicates a healthy stock level where exploitation can continue without severe depletion, ensuring higher payoffs while maintaining buffer capacity for future rounds.
     - **Stock Below 75% of Capacity**: Switch to cooperating (C) for the next few rounds. Cooperation helps replenish the stock, preventing overexploitation and ensuring resource availability in subsequent rounds.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - **Defect (D)**: In the final round, defect to maximize payoff without concern for future depletion since there are no subsequent rounds affected by current actions.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - **Stock Recovery Check**: After cooperating for a set number of rounds, reassess the stock level. If it recovers above the 75% threshold, revert to defecting (D) to exploit the replenished resource.
   - **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuously evaluate the stock's health and adjust actions dynamically to maintain a balance between exploitation and conservation.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, r, capacity):
    current_stock = capacity
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    
    # Initialize history to track stock levels
    stock_history = []
    
    for round in range(r):
        if round == 0:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            avg_stock = sum(stock_history[-3:]) / len(stock_history[-3:]) if len(stock_history) >=3 else current_stock
            if current_stock > threshold:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'
        
        # Execute action and update stock
        if action == 'D':
            payoff = current_stock / n
        else:
            payoff = current_stock / (2 * n)
        
        total_consumption = 0
        for player_action in all_actions:
            if player_action == 'D':
                total_consumption += current_stock / n
            else:
                total_consumption += current_stock / (2 * n)
        
        s_remaining = max(0, current_stock - total_consumption)
        growth = 2 * s_remaining * (1 - s_remaining / capacity)
        new_stock = min(s_remaining + growth, capacity)
        
        stock_history.append(new_stock)
        current_stock = new_stock
        
        # Last round handling
        if round == r - 1:
            action = 'D'
    
    return total_payoff

# Example usage for n=4, r=10, capacity=100
strategy = adaptive_exploitation(4, 10, 100)
```

### Strategy Explanation

This strategy is designed to be both exploitative and sustainable. By defecting initially when the stock is plentiful, it maximizes early payoffs. As the game progresses, continuous monitoring of the stock level ensures that if depletion exceeds a safe threshold, cooperation kicks in to allow recovery. This adaptive approach prevents overexploitation while still capitalizing on opportunities for higher gains when possible. The final round defect ensures maximum extraction without future consequences, optimizing overall payoff across all rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_301 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to set a cooperative tone and observe other players' behavior.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - For each subsequent round, evaluate the cooperation rate of other players from the previous round.
     - Calculate `others_cooperation_rate` as the number of Cooperate actions divided by (n-1).
   - Assess the current stock level relative to capacity:
     - If `others_cooperation_rate > 0.7` and `current_stock > 0.7 * capacity`, continue cooperating.
     - If `others_cooperation_rate ≤ 0.7` or `current_stock ≤ 0.7 * capacity`, switch to defecting.

3. **Endgame Strategy (Last Few Rounds):**
   - In the final rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds), prioritize defecting to maximize immediate payoffs, as future stock replenishment becomes less critical.

4. **Stock Trend Monitoring:**
   - Track the stock's trend over recent rounds. If the stock shows a decreasing trend despite high cooperation rates, consider defecting to protect your payoff.

5. **Robustness Considerations:**
   - Incorporate moving averages or trends in stock levels to inform decisions.
   - Adjust thresholds for cooperation based on observed behavior to avoid exploitation by others.

This strategy balances cooperation and defection, adapting to both the stock's health and others' actions, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_302 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to be exploitative, adaptive, and robust against various opponent behaviors. Here's a structured overview of the approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Rounds (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to establish trust and gather initial data on other players' actions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Action Determination:** Evaluate the cooperation rate of other players over the last k rounds.
     - **High Cooperation (≥75%):** Cooperate (C) to sustain stock and encourage continued cooperation.
     - **Moderate Cooperation (50-75%):** Alternate actions between C and D to signal encouragement for higher cooperation without sacrificing payoffs.
     - **Low Cooperation (<50%):** Defect (D) to exploit others' lower contributions, maximizing immediate gains.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Low Stock Levels (<2n):** Cooperate (C) to conserve the stock and allow regeneration.
   - **Final Round:** Defect (D) to maximize payoff since there's no future benefit from conservation.

### Key Considerations

- **Adaptability:** The strategy adjusts based on observed cooperation rates, ensuring responsiveness to others' actions.
- **Exploitation Balance:** Encourages cooperation when beneficial but switches to defecting when exploitation is advantageous.
- **Stock Management:** Conserves stock when necessary to ensure long-term sustainability and regeneration.

### Conclusion

This strategy effectively balances immediate gains with long-term stock health by adapting to opponents' behaviors. It's robust against various strategies, making it suitable for a competitive tournament setting where adaptability and exploitation are key.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_303 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that is adaptive and robust, we can structure our approach as follows:

1. **Initial Round (t=1)**: Cooperate to set a high initial stock level and observe others' actions.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - Monitor the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - If more than half of the players defected, switch to defecting this round.
   - Otherwise, continue cooperating to maintain a sustainable stock level.

3. **Last Round (r)**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

This strategy is reactive and exploitative, adapting based on others' behavior while considering the dynamic state of the common pool. It balances cooperation for sustainability with defection to exploit others' actions when beneficial.

**Strategy Pseudocode**:

```
function decide_action(state, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        previous_defections = count_defections(history[-1])
        total_players = n
        if previous_defections > total_players / 2:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

function count_defections(previous_actions):
    return sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == "D")

if current_round == r:
    return "D"
```

This approach ensures that the strategy is both adaptive and robust, maximizing individual payoffs while considering the actions of others.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_304 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Begin with a cooperative stance for the first few rounds (e.g., first 2 rounds) to set a baseline of cooperation.

2. **Cooperation Monitoring**: 
   - Track the percentage of players who cooperated in each round.
   - If less than 50% cooperate, switch strategy to defecting in subsequent rounds.

3. **Stock Level Management**:
   - If stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), prioritize defecting to secure immediate resources.

4. **Punishment Mechanism**:
   - Implement a punishment phase where if others are caught defecting, increase your defection rate in the next rounds to deter future exploitation.

5. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - In the final round, switch to defecting to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If stock is severely depleted (e.g., below 10% capacity), defect to ensure some resource capture.

**Pseudocode Outline**:

```
Initialize:
    cooperation_threshold = 0.5
    punishment_length = 3
    critical_stock_level = 0.25 * capacity

For each round from 1 to r:
    if current_round <= 2:
        choose C
    else:
        calculate previous_cooperation_rate = (number of Cs in last round) / n
        if cooperation_threshold < previous_cooperation_rate and stock > critical_stock_level:
            choose C
        else:
            choose D

    monitor others' actions for defection
    if detected_defection:
        start punishment timer

    while punishment_timer > 0:
        choose D
        decrement punishment_timer

    in last_round:
        choose D

Implement adaptive adjustments based on stock levels and historical cooperation rates.
```

This strategy balances between exploiting current resources and maintaining future sustainability, adapting to others' actions without assuming cooperation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_305 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we have developed a sophisticated approach that balances immediate gain with long-term sustainability. This strategy, named "Adaptive Exploitation," is designed to maximize each player's total payoff while ensuring the resource remains viable over multiple rounds.

### Strategy Overview

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - In the first round, the player will cooperate (C). This initial cooperation serves as a baseline and allows observation of other players' behaviors without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Stock Conservation Threshold:**
   - If the current stock level falls below 25% of the capacity, the player will switch to cooperation in subsequent rounds until the stock is replenished above this threshold. This ensures that the resource does not become critically depleted and maintains future earning potential.

3. **Defection Rate Analysis:**
   - The strategy continuously monitors the average defection rate of other players over the previous rounds. If the majority (more than 50%) of other players have defected historically, the player will adopt a defective strategy (D) to exploit their behavior and secure higher immediate payoffs.

4. **Final Round Exploitation:**
   - In the final round of play, the player will always defect (D), as there is no future stock to preserve. This maximizes immediate gain without concern for long-term resource sustainability.

### Strategic Rationale

- **Adaptability:** The strategy adjusts based on both the current state of the resource and the historical actions of other players. This adaptability allows the player to respond effectively to varying levels of cooperation or defection among opponents.
  
- **Exploitation:** By defecting when others are observed to defect frequently, the player can secure higher payoffs in scenarios where cooperation is not reciprocated, thereby exploiting the non-cooperative tendencies of others.

- **Conservation:** The inclusion of a stock conservation mechanism ensures that the resource remains sufficiently abundant for future rounds, preventing premature depletion and maintaining earning potential over the entire game duration.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, total_rounds):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate stock conservation threshold (25% of capacity)
    conservation_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    
    if current_stock < conservation_threshold:
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate average defection rate of other players
    # Here, 'history' is a list where each element represents the number of defectors in previous rounds
    avg_defection_rate = sum(history) / len(history)
    
    if avg_defection_rate > 0.5:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"

def final_round_strategy():
    return "D"
```

### Conclusion

The Adaptive Exploitation strategy is a robust and adaptive approach designed to maximize total payoffs in the Common Pool Resource game. By integrating elements of cooperation, conservation, and strategic defection based on observed behaviors, this strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term resource sustainability, making it highly competitive in a tournament setting against diverse opponent strategies.

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the stock. The strategy adapts based on observed behavior and current stock levels.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C)
   - Start by Cooperating to establish a high initial stock level, promoting future sustainability.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   - **Condition Check:** 
     - If the current stock is above 75% of the game's capacity AND fewer than half of the players Defected in the previous round → Choose Cooperate (C).
     - Otherwise, choose Defect (D).

3. **Last Round (round r):** Always Defect (D)
   - In the final round, prioritize immediate maximum payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Pseudocode Representation

```pseudocode
current_strategy = "C"  // Initial cooperation in the first round
for each round from 2 to r-1:
    if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity and last_round_defectors < n/2:
        current_strategy = "C"
    else:
        current_strategy = "D"
    record current_strategy for next round evaluation
round_r_strategy = "D"  // Always defect in the last round to maximize immediate payoff

```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, we ensure a strong foundation of high stock levels, which can be exploited in subsequent rounds.
  
- **Adaptive Decision Making:** The strategy dynamically adjusts based on both the health of the stock and the behavior of other players. If the stock remains robust and cooperation is prevalent, it continues to cooperate. Otherwise, it shifts to defecting to secure higher immediate gains.

- **Final Round Exploitation:** Recognizing that the last round offers no future consequences, the strategy ensures maximum payoff by always defecting, capitalizing on any remaining resources without concern for sustainability.

This approach effectively balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, ensuring a competitive edge while maintaining flexibility based on game dynamics.

**Strategy: Adaptive Reactor**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to maximize initial payoffs without harming the resource.

2. **Monitor and Punish:**
   - Track the average payoff per player over the last few rounds.
   - If this average falls below a certain threshold, indicating others are defecting excessively, switch to defecting for a set number of rounds to stabilize the stock and deter overexploitation.

3. **Reactive Adjustment:**
   - Continuously observe the current stock level and growth rate.
   - Adjust strategy based on whether the resource is being sustainably used or depleted too quickly.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final rounds, shift towards defecting to maximize immediate payoffs since future punishment isn't possible.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
Initialize:
    cooperate = True
    recent_payoffs = []
    threshold = 0.8 * average_max_payoff

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round:
        choose C
    else:
        calculate average_payoff of last few rounds
        if average_payoff < threshold and stock is depleting too fast:
            cooperate = False
            choose D for next X rounds
        elif recent actions show cooperation from others:
            cooperate = True

    observe outcomes, update recent_payoffs
    near_end = (current_round > r - Y)
    if near_end:
        choose D to maximize immediate payoff

Update strategy dynamically based on observed stock levels and opponent behavior.
```

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring sustainable resource use while adapting to others' actions.

   - Track the number of players defecting and the stock level after each round.
   - If the average number of defectors exceeds a threshold (e.g., more than half) or if the stock falls below a critical level (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch strategy to defecting.
   - Continue this evaluation in subsequent rounds, adapting based on recent trends.

3. **Final Round Exploitation:**

3. **Punishment Mechanism**:
   - Track the number of defectors in each round.
   - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, retaliate by defecting in the current round to punish and deter future defection.

   - When the stock is healthy (above 50% capacity) and fewer than half defected last round, exploit by defecting to maximize personal payoff.

5. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final round, cooperate to prevent stock depletion, ensuring a sustainable end to the game.

**Pseudocode:**

```

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_311 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round while balancing immediate gains and long-term sustainability, we propose the following strategy:

### Strategy:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate. This initiates a cooperative tone and allows for the highest possible initial stock level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Let \( D_{t-1} \) be the number of players who Defected in round \( t-1 \).
   - Let \( S_{t-1} \) be the stock level after round \( t-1 \).
   - If either:
     - The number of Defectors in the previous round exceeds half of all players (\( D_{t-1} > n/2 \)), or
     - The stock level after the previous round is below half of the capacity (\( S_{t-1} < \text{capacity}/2 \)),
   - then choose to Defect in round \( t \).
   - Otherwise, Cooperate.

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation maximizes the initial stock and encourages others to do the same.
- **Trigger-Based Switching:** The strategy switches to Defection if a significant portion of players are already defecting or if the stock is critically low. This balances exploiting current gains while preserving the resource for future rounds.

### Conclusion:
This approach ensures that you maximize your payoffs when possible while preventing the stock from depleting too much, thus maintaining a sustainable balance over all rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_312 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we must balance between maximizing immediate payoffs and maintaining the stock for future rounds. The strategy should adapt to others' actions and the current state of the stock.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and History

1. **First Round Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe the initial stock dynamics.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each subsequent round, evaluate the stock level relative to capacity.
   - If the stock falls below 25% of capacity, switch to Defecting for all remaining rounds to exploit whatever remains before it's depleted.

3. **Assess Others' Actions**: Track the number of players who Defected in the previous round.
   - If more than half of the players defected last round, choose to Defect in the current round. This avoids being exploited while others take advantage of the resource.

4. **Last Round Exploitation**: In the final round (r), always Defect since there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for, maximizing immediate payoff without concern for depletion consequences.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1  # 1-based indexing
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    stock_last = history[-1]['stock_after']  # Get last stock after update
    
    # Check if stock is below 25% of capacity
    if stock_last < 0.25 * capacity:
        return "D"
    
    # Count number of defectors in the previous round
    defectors_last_round = sum(1 for action in history[-1]['actions'] if action == 'D')
    
    # If more than half defected last round, defect this round
    if defectors_last_round > n / 2:
        return "D"
    
    # Cooperate otherwise
    return "C"

# In the last round, always defect regardless of other conditions
def last_round_strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    return "D"
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, we encourage a high initial stock level and observe how others behave.
- **Stock Threshold Check**: If the stock drops too low (below 25%), it signals that future rounds won't sustain growth, so exploiting becomes optimal.
- **Responsive Defection**: Monitoring others' actions allows us to avoid being exploited. If most players are defecting, joining them prevents significant losses from others over-consuming.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Since there's no future beyond the last round, defecting ensures maximum immediate gain without concern for stock depletion effects.

This strategy is robust and adaptive, ensuring that we maximize our payoffs while considering both the actions of others and the state of the common resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_313 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I've developed a balanced approach that combines cooperation with targeted defection to maximize personal gain while maintaining the stock's sustainability.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability (AES)

#### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to initiate with maximum stock growth.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without future repercussions.
   - **Stock Recovery Threshold**: If the current stock is below 20% of capacity, Cooperate to allow recovery.
   - **Defection Response**: Count the number of players who defected in the previous round. If this count exceeds half the total number of players (n/2), Defect in the current round as a punitive measure.

This strategy ensures that you cooperate when beneficial for stock sustainability but defect when others exploit excessively, encouraging a balance between personal gain and resource preservation.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def aes_strategy(t, prev_actions, stock, capacity, n):
    if t == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif t == r:
        return 'D'
    else:
        d_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
        recovery_threshold = 0.2 * capacity
        if stock < recovery_threshold:
            return 'C'
        elif d_count > n / 2:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to build a healthy stock level.
- **Stock Recovery**: Switches to cooperation when the stock is critically low, ensuring future rounds have higher payoffs.
- **Punitive Defection**: Defects in response to significant previous defection (>50%), discouraging others from exploiting without consequence.
- **Last Round Exploitation**: Maximizes personal gain in the final round, as there are no subsequent rounds to affect.

This strategy is robust against various behaviors and adapts dynamically based on game state and history.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_314 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can structure our approach based on the following considerations:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to set a cooperative tone and encourage others to do the same.

2. **Adaptive Strategy Based on History**: Monitor the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than 50% defected, switch to defecting in the current round to avoid being exploited and to punish defectors.

3. **Stock Level Consideration**: Keep an eye on the stock level. If it falls below 25% of capacity, switch to cooperating to allow regrowth, ensuring sustainability for future rounds.

4. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final round, always defect since there is no future punishment possible, maximizing immediate payoff without concern for long-term consequences.

**Strategy Summary**:

- **First Round**: Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If >50% of players defected last round → Defect.
  - If stock <25% of capacity → Cooperate to allow regrowth.
  - Otherwise, Cooperate.
- **Final Round**: Always Defect.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to both the behavior of other players and the health of the common pool resource.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_315 = '''
To address the problem, we'll create an adaptive strategy that balances immediate gain with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance against diverse opponent behaviors.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Preservation

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **Initial Action (First Round):**
  - **Action:** Defect (D)
  - **Rationale:** Maximize initial payoff and test opponents' strategies without risking immediate loss.

- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - **Monitor Cooperation Rate:** Track the average cooperation rate of all players over the past rounds.
    - **If Average ≥ Threshold (e.g., 50%):** Cooperate (C)
      - Rationale: High cooperation sustains stock; aligning with others maintains resource health.
    - **If Average < Threshold:** Defect (D)
      - Rationale: Low cooperation indicates exploitation is possible without significant risk to future stock.

- **Stock Level Consideration:**
  - **Threshold Check:** If current stock falls below a critical level (e.g., 50% of capacity):
    - Switch to Cooperate (C) temporarily to allow regeneration.
  - **Adjustment:** If after switching, stock recovers above the threshold, resume evaluating cooperation rate.

- **Final Round:**
  - **Action:** Defect (D)
  - **Rationale:** Maximize payoff in the last round as future stock isn't a concern.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

- **First Round:** Always defect to gauge opponent behavior and maximize immediate gain.
- **Last Round:** Prioritize immediate payoff by defecting, ensuring no future repercussions.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Temporarily switch to cooperation if stock is critically low to prevent depletion and allow regeneration.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**

The strategy exploits opponents' cooperation by defecting when possible while preserving the stock through adaptive behavior. It aligns with an exploitative mindset by maximizing payoffs when others cooperate and adjusting to prevent overexploitation.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round, total_rounds, history):
    if round == 1:
        return "D"
    
    avg_cooperation = calculate_average_cooperation(history)
    stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    
    if current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return "C"
    
    if avg_cooperation >= 0.5:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

def calculate_average_cooperation(history):
    cooperations = sum(1 for actions in history for action in actions if action == 'C')
    total_actions = len(history) * n
    return cooperations / total_actions
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Defection:** Tests opponents and maximizes first-round payoff.
- **Cooperation Monitoring:** Adapts based on others' behavior to maintain stock health when possible.
- **Stock Preservation:** Prevents overexploitation by temporarily cooperating if stock is low.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** Ensures maximum gain in the last round without future considerations.

This strategy effectively balances exploitation and sustainability, making it robust against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_316 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we need to balance between maximizing immediate payoffs and maintaining the sustainability of the resource for future rounds. The strategy must be adaptive, taking into account both the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and History

1. **Initial Round (First Move):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to build trust and observe others' initial behavior without immediately exploiting, which could lead to retaliatory actions in subsequent rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Previous Actions:** Track the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** Assess the current stock level relative to the capacity.

3. **Decision Rules for Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Critical Stock Level (Below 25% of Capacity):** Cooperate (C) to conserve the stock and allow regrowth, preventing depletion that could harm future payoffs.
   - **High Stock Level (Above 25% of Capacity):** 
     - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, Defect (D) to exploit their behavior and secure a higher payoff without significant risk to stock sustainability.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate (C) to maintain the stock and encourage continued cooperation among players.

4. **Final Round Consideration:**
   - In the last round, the strategy may choose to defect to maximize immediate gain, recognizing that there are no future consequences. However, this is optional and can be omitted if maintaining cooperation is deemed more beneficial based on the stock level.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategyParameters(n, capacity):
    current_stock = initial_stock  # Initially set to capacity
    history = []  # To keep track of previous actions

    for round in range(1, r+1):
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            previous_actions = history[-1]
            num_defectors = sum(1 for a in previous_actions if a == 'D')
            
            if current_stock < 0.25 * capacity:
                action = 'C'
            elif num_defectors > n / 2:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'

        # Record action and update history
        history.append([action for _ in range(n)])

    return history
```

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation sets a baseline of trust, allowing the strategy to gauge others' behaviors without immediate exploitation.
- **Stock Conservation:** By cooperating when the stock is critically low, the strategy ensures that the resource can regrow, maintaining its availability for future exploitation.
- **Responsive Defection:** When a significant number of players defect, the strategy shifts to defection to capitalize on their actions, thus maximizing personal gain without undermining the stock's sustainability excessively.
- **Adaptability:** The strategy dynamically adjusts based on both the stock level and others' past actions, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.

This approach ensures that the player can exploit opportunities for higher payoffs while maintaining the resource's health, balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, Cooperate (C) to encourage others to do the same, promoting initial stock sustainability.
   - **Monitor Opponents' Actions:** Track the number of times other players choose to Defect (D) over the past few rounds, using a moving average to smooth out noise and assess cooperation trends.
   - **Stock Level Consideration:** Continuously monitor the current stock level. If it falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to Defecting (D) to secure immediate payoffs before potential depletion.
   - **Adaptive Response:** 
     - If the average cooperation rate among other players over recent rounds drops below a set threshold (e.g., 50%), switch to Defecting (D).
     - Incorporate a forgiveness mechanism: if opponents' cooperation rate increases after a period of defection, revert to Cooperating (C) gradually.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and encourage others.
   - **Last Round:** Assess the stock level; cooperate if it's sufficient for future rounds or defect if depletion is imminent.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock approaches zero, Defect to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Exploitative Mindset:**
   - Balance between exploiting current conditions for higher payoffs and preserving the resource for future use.
   - Use past actions to inform decisions, adapting strategies based on opponents' behavior without relying on coordination or norms.

4. **Pseudocode Outline:**
   ```python
   Initialize:
       cooperation_threshold = 0.5  # Adjust based on game parameters
       stock_critical_level = capacity * 0.25
       recent_rounds_window = 3

   For each round from 1 to r:
       If it's the first round:
           choose C
       Else:
           calculate average_cooperation_rate = (number of Cooperate choices by others in last 'recent_rounds_window' rounds) / (n * recent_rounds_window)
           if stock < stock_critical_level or average_cooperation_rate < cooperation_threshold:
               choose D
           else:
               choose C

   Update history after each round to track opponents' actions and stock levels.
   ```

This strategy aims to maximize payoffs by adaptively responding to opponents' behaviors while preserving the resource for sustained benefits, ensuring robustness against diverse opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_318 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we must balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy adapts based on stock levels, remaining rounds, and opponents' past actions. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and History (AEBH)

1. **First Round**: Always cooperate to set a cooperative tone and observe others' initial moves.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Stock Check**: If the current stock level is above half of the capacity, proceed to evaluate cooperation based on past actions.
     - **Past Actions**: Cooperate if fewer than half of the players defected in the previous round.
     - **Retaliation**: Defect if half or more defected previously to retaliate and deter future defections.
   - **Stock Conservation**: If the stock is below half capacity, cooperate to allow recovery, ensuring sustainability for future rounds.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation encourages others to reciprocate and builds a foundation for potential mutual benefit.
  
- **Adaptive Response**: By cooperating when stock is sufficient and others have not defected, the strategy promotes a balance between exploitation and conservation. Retaliating against defections maintains fairness and discourages exploitation by others.

- **Stock Conservation**: When resources are scarce, prioritizing recovery ensures that future rounds remain viable, preventing premature depletion.

- **Final Round Exploitation**: Maximizing gain in the last round is strategic as there are no subsequent rounds to affect, allowing for unrestricted resource capture.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, adapting dynamically based on game state and opponent behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_319 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Retaliation and Sustainability (AERS)**

1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1 to r/2):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C) to contribute to stock growth and observe others' behavior.
   - **Objective:** Build a high stock level and gather information on other players' tendencies.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - **Monitor Cooperation Rate:** Track the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
     - **If ≥ 50% Cooperated:** Continue cooperating to sustain or grow the stock.
     - **If < 50% Cooperated:** Switch to defecting to exploit others' cooperation and maximize immediate payoffs.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), cooperate to allow recovery, preventing severe depletion.

3. **Retaliation Mechanism:**
   - **Punishment for Defection:** If players defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to retaliate and discourage future defection.
   - **Forgiveness:** If others start cooperating after retaliation, revert to cooperation to rebuild stock.

4. **Final Rounds (Last few rounds):**
   - **Action near Capacity:** If stock is near capacity, defect to maximize immediate gains as future rounds are limited.
     - **Example:** In the last round, always defect to secure the highest possible payoff since there's no subsequent round to affect.
   - **Low Stock in Late Game:** Cooperate if the stock is low to extend the game's sustainability and ensure some payoffs rather than depleting the resource entirely.

5. **Balancing Exploitation and Sustainability:**
   - **Sustainability Check:** Periodically cooperate to prevent stock from plummeting, ensuring long-term playability and payoffs.
   - **Exploit When Possible:** Defect when others are cooperating to gain higher payoffs without significant risk of immediate resource depletion.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
function decide_action(history, current_stock, capacity):
    if current_round <= initial_threshold:
        return "C"
    
    previous_actions = history[-1]
    cooperators = count_of_C_in_previous_actions
    total_players = n
    
    cooperation_rate = cooperators / total_players
    
    if cooperation_rate >= 0.5 and current_stock > stock_threshold:
        return "C"
    elif cooperation_rate < 0.5:
        return "D"
    
    # Check for retaliation needed
    if previous_actions had high defection:
        return "D"  # Retaliate
    
    # Stock near capacity in late game
    if current_round > r - final_threshold and current_stock >= capacity * 0.9:
        return "D"
    
    # If stock is low, cooperate to recover
    if current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return "C"
    
    return "D"  # Default action

# Parameters to adjust based on game dynamics
initial_threshold = r/2
stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
final_threshold = 2  # Last two rounds
```

This strategy balances immediate exploitation with long-term sustainability, adapts based on opponents' actions, and ensures robustness against various behaviors in a competitive environment.

1. **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate for the first two rounds to observe others' behavior without immediate retaliation.
2. **Monitor Defections**: Track the number of players who defect in each round, especially focusing on recent behavior.
3. **Reciprocation**: If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, switch to Defecting in the current round to avoid being exploited.
4. **Stock Conservation**: When the stock level falls below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), assess others' recent cooperation. Continue Cooperating if most are still cooperating; otherwise, Defect.
5. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last two rounds, always Defect to maximize immediate payoffs since future consequences are limited.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

# Initialize parameters
cooperation_threshold = 0.5  # If proportion of defectors exceeds this, switch to D
stock_threshold = 0.5        # Proportion of initial stock capacity
endgame_rounds = 2           # Number of final rounds to always defect

def decide_action(current_round, total_rounds, prev_defectors, current_stock, initial_capacity):
    if current_round <= 2:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first two rounds
    
    proportion_defected = prev_defectors / n_players
    is_endgame = current_round > (total_rounds - endgame_rounds)

    if stock_level < stock_threshold:
        # Check recent cooperation rate
        recent_cooperation_rate = calculate_recent_cooperation(prev_actions, window=3)
        if recent_cooperation_rate <= 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    
    return 'C'

# Main loop (simplified)
prev_defectors = 0
current_stock = initial_capacity  # Assume starting at full capacity

for round_num in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    if round_num == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        action = decide_action(round_num, total_rounds, prev_defectors, current_stock, initial_capacity)
    
    # Simulate the action and update state
    if action == 'D':
        payoff = current_stock / n_players
    else:
        payoff = current_stock / (2 * n_players)
    
    total_consumption = sum of all players' actions (C: S/(2n), D: S/n)
    new_stock = min(current_stock - total_consumption + 2*(current_stock - total_consumption)*(1 - (current_stock - total_consumption)/initial_capacity), initial_capacity)
    
    prev_defectors = count of 'D' actions in this round
    current_stock = new_stock

    print(f"Round {round_num}: Action = {action}, Stock = {new_stock}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins by Cooperating to set a positive tone and gather information on others' tendencies.
- **Defection Monitoring**: After the initial rounds, it checks if more than half of the players Defected in the previous round. If so, it switches to Defecting to avoid being exploited.
- **Stock Conservation**: When the stock is low (below 50% capacity), it evaluates recent cooperation rates. It continues Cooperating only if others are also mostly Cooperating; otherwise, it Defects to secure remaining payoffs.
- **Endgame Focus**: In the final two rounds, it always Defects to maximize immediate gains since there's no future stock to preserve.

This strategy aims to balance reciprocity with self-interest, ensuring that while cooperation is encouraged for mutual benefit, defection is employed when necessary to protect one's own interests.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to observe opponents' initial actions without impacting the stock negatively.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**:
     1. Calculate the average defection rate of all opponents over the last few rounds (e.g., moving average of past 3-5 rounds).
     2. If the average defection rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 50%), choose to Defect (D) to exploit their actions.
     3. Monitor the current stock level. If it falls below a specified threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to Cooperate (C) to help replenish the stock.
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as future consequences are irrelevant.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **First Round**: Start with cooperation to gather initial data on opponents' behavior.
   - **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock is below a critical threshold, prioritize cooperation to ensure resource sustainability for future rounds.
   - **Last Round**: Optimize for immediate gain by defecting, disregarding long-term stock health.

3. **Exploitative Approach**:
   - The strategy exploits opponents' cooperation by defecting when beneficial while preserving resource stocks by cooperating when necessary. It balances exploitation with sustainability to maximize overall payoffs across all rounds.

This strategy dynamically adapts based on opponents' actions and the game's state, ensuring robust performance against diverse behaviors in a competitive environment.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_322 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline and gauge other players' behavior without immediate exploitation.
  
- **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
  - Observe the number of players who defected in the previous round.
  - If more than half of the players defected last round, defect (D) this round to avoid being exploited.
  - If the stock after growth is below 50% of capacity, defect (D) to maximize immediate gain before depletion.
  - Otherwise, cooperate (C) to maintain a sustainable stock level and encourage mutual benefit.

- **Last Round (Round r):** Always Defect (D) to secure maximum immediate payoff, as future rounds do not matter.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- If the stock after growth drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to defecting in subsequent rounds to capture remaining resources.
- Consistently monitor the trend of the stock level; if it's decreasing over multiple rounds, adjust strategy towards defection to prevent further depletion.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
The strategy adapts based on observed behavior and current state, aiming to exploit others' cooperation while avoiding exploitation itself. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adjusting actions according to the stock level and opponents' recent decisions.

This approach ensures robustness against various opponent behaviors, maximizing payoffs by being adaptive yet cautious in a competitive environment.

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on adapting to opponents' behaviors while maximizing individual payoffs. The approach balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observed actions and stock levels.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to observe others' actions and establish a baseline.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - **Monitor Consumption History**: Track the average total consumption over the past few rounds relative to the stock.
   - **Defection Thresholds**: If historical consumption exceeds half the stock, switch to defection. Also, defect if the current stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., capacity/2).

3. **Endgame Strategy**: Always defect in the final round to maximize immediate payoff.

### Detailed Decision Rules:

- **First Round**: Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Calculate average total consumption over the last three rounds as a fraction of the stock at that time.
  - If this average exceeds 0.5, defect; otherwise, cooperate.
  - Additionally, defect if the current stock is below capacity/2.
- **Last Round**: Defect to maximize payoff.

This strategy ensures we exploit opportunities when others overconsume while preserving resources when cooperation is beneficial, adapting dynamically to maintain robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_324 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we need a balanced approach that considers both immediate gains and long-term sustainability. The proposed strategy dynamically adjusts based on the remaining rounds and current stock levels.

**Strategy: Dynamic Threshold Approach**

1. **Initial Round (t=1):**
   - Cooperate to set a high initial stock level, encouraging a sustainable start.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (t < r):**
   - Calculate a dynamic threshold each round as:
     \[
     \text{threshold} = \text{capacity} \times \left(1 - \frac{t}{r}\right)
     \]
   - If the current stock \( S_t \) is above this threshold, Cooperate to preserve the stock for future rounds.
   - If \( S_t \) is below or equal to the threshold, Defect to secure higher payoffs as the game progresses.

3. **Last Round (t=r):**
   - Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no subsequent rounds to consider.

This strategy ensures that early on, the stock remains healthy, allowing for growth and sustainable use across all rounds. As the game progresses towards its end, it becomes more lenient, enabling higher exploitation without depleting the stock before the final round. This approach is both exploitative and robust, adapting dynamically based on the game's state and parameters.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```python
def dynamic_threshold_strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, current_round):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif current_round == r:
        return "D"  # Defect in the last round
    else:
        threshold = capacity * (1 - current_round / r)
        if current_stock > threshold:
            return "C"  # Cooperate to preserve stock
        else:
            return "D"  # Defect to maximize payoff

# Example usage within a round
action = dynamic_threshold_strategy(n, r, capacity, S_t, t)

This strategy balances cooperation and defection dynamically, ensuring long-term payoffs while being responsive to the game's progression.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_325 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll outline a structured approach that balances immediate gain with long-term sustainability. This strategy will adapt based on observed behavior and stock levels to maximize individual payoffs while considering the dynamic state of the game.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - **Parameters**: Track the number of players (n), rounds (r), capacity, and initial stock.
   - **State Variables**: Maintain history of past actions, payoffs, and stock levels.

2. **First Round Decision**:
   - Since there's no historical data, adopt a conservative approach by Cooperating (C). This allows observation of others' actions without immediate depletion.

3. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Monitor Stock Health**: Calculate the current stock level relative to capacity and track its trend over previous rounds.
   - **Assess Cooperation Levels**: Determine the average cooperation rate among other players using historical data. If a significant number are cooperating, identify opportunities to defect without causing severe depletion.

4. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: If the stock falls below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to Cooperate to allow regrowth.
   - **Exploit When Possible**: If others are mostly cooperating and stock is healthy, Defect to maximize immediate payoffs.

5. **Last Round Strategy**:
   - In the final round, prioritize immediate gain by defecting to consume more, as there's no future impact on the stock.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(game_params, state, history):
    n = game_params['n']
    r = game_params['r']
    capacity = game_params['capacity']
    
    current_stock = state['current_stock']
    round_num = state['round_num']
    
    if round_num == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Assess stock health
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    
    # Calculate average cooperation rate of others in previous rounds
    prev_cooperations = sum([action != 'D' for action in history['actions'][-n:])
    avg_coop = prev_cooperations / n
    
    if round_num == r:
        return 'D'
    
    if stock_ratio < 0.5 or (avg_coop >= 0.7 and stock_ratio > 0.3):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

### Strategy Explanation

- **Initial Round**: Cooperate to observe others' behaviors.
- **Stock Monitoring**: Adjust strategy based on whether the stock is below a critical threshold, ensuring sustainability.
- **Cooperation Assessment**: Use historical data to determine when others are likely cooperating, allowing strategic defection without harming future payoffs.
- **Final Round Maximization**: Defect in the last round to maximize immediate gain.

This approach balances exploitation with conservation, adapting dynamically to maintain resource health while seeking opportunities for higher payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_326 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitative Strategy with Stock Conservation and Punishment**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and maintain the stock at capacity.
   - **Last Round (r):** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds don't matter.
   - **Middle Rounds (2 to r-1):**
     - If the current stock level is below 50% of the game's capacity, Cooperate to help replenish the stock.
     - Otherwise, check the number of players who Cooperated in the previous round:
       - If at least half (rounded up) Cooperated, continue Cooperating.
       - If fewer than half Cooperated, Defect as a punitive measure and to avoid being exploited.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to encourage initial stock sustainability.
   - **Last Round:** Maximize personal gain by Defecting since there are no future consequences.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize stock recovery when the stock falls below a critical threshold (50% of capacity) to ensure long-term resource availability.

3. **Exploitative Mindset:**
   The strategy balances cooperation to sustain resources with strategic defection to exploit others' cooperation and punish widespread defection. It adapts based on both historical actions and current stock levels, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors without relying on coordination or shared norms.

**Pseudocode Illustration:**

```
function decide_action(current_round, r, current_stock, capacity, prev_actions):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == r:
        return "D"
    else:
        if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
            return "C"
        else:
            coop_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == "C")
            half_players = n / 2
            if coop_count >= half_players:
                return "C"
            else:
                return "D"
```

This strategy is designed to be adaptive, ensuring that while it seeks to exploit others' cooperation when beneficial, it also conserves the resource for future rounds and punishes defection to maintain a balance that favors sustainable exploitation.

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **Initial Cooperation (First Round):** Cooperate to maximize initial payoffs without depleting the stock.
- **Monitor & Adapt:** After the first round, observe the number of defectors and the stock level.
  - If the number of defectors is above a threshold or the stock drops below a certain level, switch to defecting for a set number of rounds.
  - Once conditions improve (fewer defectors, stock recovery), revert to cooperation.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Always cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and maximize initial payoff.
- **Last Round:** Consider defecting if the stock is sufficiently depleted or if others are likely to defect, prioritizing short-term gain.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If stock is critically low, defect to secure immediate benefits, as future rounds may offer no advantage.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
The strategy is designed to exploit others' behaviors by initially cooperating but swiftly punishing defection. It monitors the game state and adjusts actions to maximize payoffs while maintaining the stock for future exploitation if conditions allow. This approach ensures robustness against various opponent strategies without relying on coordination.
'''

To address the problem, we need a strategy that balances cooperation and defection in a repeated game scenario. The goal is to maintain a healthy stock level while responding appropriately to opponents' actions.

**Approach:**

1. **First Round Cooperation:** Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a high stock level for future rounds.
2. **Last Round Defection:** In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no subsequent rounds to affect.
3. **Stock Protection Threshold:** If the stock falls below 20% of its capacity, cooperate to allow replenishment, regardless of opponents' past actions.
4. **Defection Response Threshold:** Monitor the average defection rate across all previous rounds. If this rate exceeds 30%, switch to defecting in subsequent rounds to avoid being exploited.

This approach ensures that we maintain stock levels while strategically responding to others' behavior.

**Solution Code:**

```python
def game_strategy(current_round, total_rounds, current_stock, capacity, historical_actions):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    else:
        stock_threshold = 0.2 * capacity

        total_defections = sum(action.count('D') for action in historical_actions)
        avg_defection_rate = total_defections / (total_players * previous_rounds)
        
        if current_stock < stock_threshold:
            return "C"
        elif avg_defection_rate > cooperation_threshold:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
```

**Explanation:**

- **First Round:** Always cooperate to maximize initial stock.
- **Last Round:** Defect to secure maximum payoff in the final interaction.
- **Stock Check:** Cooperate if stock is critically low to ensure replenishment.
- **Defection Monitoring:** Calculate the average defection rate. If it exceeds 30%, defect to avoid exploitation.

This strategy effectively balances between preserving resources and strategically responding to opponents' actions, ensuring optimal outcomes throughout the game.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_329 = '''
To address the complexities of the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose an adaptive exploitative strategy that balances immediate gain with long-term sustainability. Here's how the strategy is structured:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to observe others' behavior and set a baseline for stock management.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Calculate the cooperation rate from the previous round.
     - If the cooperation rate exceeds 50%, continue cooperating if the stock is above a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity).
     - If the cooperation rate is below 50%, defect to maximize immediate payoff or prevent excessive depletion.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level.
     - If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 20%), switch to cooperating temporarily to allow recovery, regardless of others' actions.

4. **Final Round Action:**
   - Defect in the last round to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```
Initialize:
    cooperate_count = 0
    previous_stock = capacity

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round:
        action = C
    else:
        cooperation_rate = (cooperate_count / n) * 100
        if cooperation_rate > 50 and previous_stock > critical_threshold:
            action = C
        elif cooperation_rate <= 50 or previous_stock <= critical_threshold:
            action = D
        # Handle stock recovery if critically low
        if previous_stock <= critical_threshold:
            action = C

    take_action(action)
    observe_actions_and_payoffs()
    update_cooperate_count()
    previous_stock = new_stock

    if it's the last round:
        action = D
```

### Strategy Explanation:
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to establish a baseline and encourage others to do the same.
- **Cooperation Rate Check:** If most players are cooperating, continue to do so to maintain stock levels. Defect if cooperation is low to avoid being exploited.
- **Stock Recovery Mechanism:** Switch to cooperation if the stock is critically low to prevent depletion and ensure future payoffs.
- **Final Round Defection:** Maximize payoff in the last round as there's no incentive to preserve stock beyond that point.

This strategy aims to exploit others' cooperation while ensuring the resource isn't over-exploited, balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

To maximize your payoff in the game while considering both cooperation and strategic defection, follow this structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to set a cooperative tone and preserve the stock for future rounds.
2. **Monitor Defection Rates**: Track how many players defect each round. If the average defection rate exceeds 50%, switch to defecting for a few rounds as punishment.
3. **Stock Level Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the stock level trend. If it consistently drops below 75% of capacity, begin defecting until recovery or others' cooperation resumes.
4. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final 20% of rounds, shift towards defecting to maximize immediate gains, especially if the stock is low and future rounds are limited.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate to establish a high starting stock and encourage others to follow suit.

2. **Middle Rounds Strategy**:
   - Calculate the average number of defections in previous rounds.
     - If more than half the players defected on average, defect for the next 2-3 rounds as punishment.
   - Track the stock level trend over the last few (e.g., 3) rounds.
     - If there's a consistent downward trend below 75% of capacity, switch to defecting until recovery or cooperation resumes.

3. **Endgame Adjustment**:
   - In the final rounds (last 20%), prioritize immediate payoffs by defecting more frequently.
   - If stock is near zero and several rounds remain, consider cooperating to allow growth for future gains.
   - However, if only a few rounds are left with low stock, defect to maximize current payoff.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Low Stock Scenario**: When the stock is below 10% of capacity, cooperate if multiple rounds remain to facilitate growth. If nearing the end, defect to capture any remaining value.

By following this adaptive strategy, you balance cooperation and strategic defection to optimize your overall payoff while responding to both group behavior and resource sustainability.

To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game with multiple players, we can develop a strategy that balances maintaining the stock for future rounds with maximizing immediate payoffs when necessary. The approach considers the current stock level, the number of previous defectors, and the proximity to the end of the game.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and maintain a high stock level.
2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - **Defect if Stock is Low or Many Defected Previously**: If the current stock falls below half of its capacity or more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect to avoid being exploited and maximize immediate gains.
   - **Endgame Defection**: In the last 20% of the rounds (i.e., when more than 80% of the total rounds have been played), switch to defection regardless of other factors to secure higher payoffs since future impact is limited.

### Strategy Details:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Let \( K \) be the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - If the current stock level \( S \) is below half of the capacity or \( K \) exceeds half of the total number of players, defect.
   - In the final 20% of the rounds (e.g., when the current round exceeds 80% of the total rounds), defect to maximize immediate payoffs.

### Example Walkthrough:
- **Parameters**: 4 players, 5 rounds, capacity = 100.
- **Round 1**: All cooperate; stock remains at 100.
- **Round 2**: If all cooperate again, stock stays at 100.
- **Round 3**: Suppose 2 defect. Stock drops to 62.5 after growth.
- **Round 4**: Since it's the penultimate round (80% of total rounds), defect regardless of other factors.
- **Round 5**: Defect as it's the final round.

This strategy ensures that cooperation is maintained when beneficial, while switching to defection when necessary to prevent exploitation and maximize payoffs near the game's end.

### Strategy Overview
The strategy combines cooperation with adaptive defection based on observed behavior and resource levels. It starts with cooperation, then dynamically adjusts based on historical defection rates and current stock levels.

### Key Steps:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to promote initial sustainability.
2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - For each subsequent round before the last, calculate the average rate of defection among all players up to that point.
   - If this average exceeds a threshold (e.g., 30%) or the current stock drops below a set percentage of capacity (e.g., 60%), switch to Defecting.
3. **Final Round Exploitation**: Always Defect in the last round to maximize immediate gain, as future sustainability is no longer a concern.

### Rationale
- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages resource conservation and growth early on.
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Adjust behavior based on collective actions (defection rate) and resource availability (stock level).
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Maximizes personal gain when long-term considerations are irrelevant.

This strategy aims to balance cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring both immediate benefits and resource sustainability until the endgame.

To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adapts based on game parameters, state, and history, we'll use a responsive approach that balances between preserving the stock for future rounds and maximizing immediate gains. The strategy focuses on reacting to others' actions and the current stock level without relying on cooperation.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C) to observe others' initial behavior and maintain a high starting stock level.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Stock Level Check**: After each round, evaluate the current stock.
     - If the stock is above half of the capacity (`stock > capacity / 2`):
       - Analyze the previous round's actions: count how many players defected.
       - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, choose to Defect (D) this round.
       - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).
     - If the stock is at or below half of the capacity (`stock <= capacity / 2`):
       - Always choose to Defect (D), prioritizing immediate gain as the stock is already depleted.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Regardless of previous actions or stock level, always Defect (D) in the final round to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation helps maintain a high initial stock and allows observation of others' strategies.
- **Responsive Adaptation**: By reacting to the number of defectors when the stock is healthy, the strategy discourages exploitation by others. When the stock is low, it prioritizes immediate gains, acknowledging that preservation may no longer be feasible.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: In the last round, with no future consequences, defecting ensures maximum payoff extraction.

This strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, focusing on self-interest while adapting dynamically based on observed actions and stock levels.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_337 = '''
To determine whether to cooperate or defect in each round of the game, we will follow a simple yet effective strategy based on the current stock level relative to the overall capacity. This approach ensures that we balance between maintaining high stock levels for future rounds and exploiting when others are not cooperating.

**Strategy:**
- **Cooperate** if the current stock level \( S_t \) is greater than half of the capacity.
- **Defect** if the current stock level \( S_t \) is less than or equal to half of the capacity.

This strategy is straightforward and adaptive, allowing us to switch our behavior based on the observed stock levels without needing to track past actions or the behavior of other players explicitly.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_338 = '''
To solve this problem, we need to create a strategy that maximizes an AI player's payoff in a repeated game scenario. The strategy should adapt dynamically based on the actions of other players and the current state of the resource (stock level). The goal is to balance cooperation to maintain the resource with strategic defection to maximize payoffs when necessary.

### Approach
The proposed approach is designed to be responsive and adaptive, ensuring that the AI player can adjust its behavior based on both the actions of others and the health of the resource. Here are the key components of the strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to maintain a high stock level initially.
2. **Adaptive Decision Making**:
   - After each round, count the number of players who defected (stopped cooperating) in the previous round.
   - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to avoid being exploited.
   - Additionally, if the current stock level falls below a critical threshold (50% of capacity), defect to maximize payoffs before the resource depletes further.
3. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final round, always defect to ensure maximum payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

This strategy ensures that the AI player cooperates when it is beneficial and switches to defection when necessary, either because others are exploiting the resource or the resource itself is becoming depleted.

### Solution Code
```python
def ai_strategy(n, current_stock, capacity, previous_defectors, is_last_round):
    """
    This function determines whether the AI should cooperate (C) or defect (D) in the current round.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of players.
    current_stock (float): Current stock level.
    capacity (float): Maximum stock capacity.
    previous_defectors (int): Number of players who defected in the previous round.
    is_last_round (bool): Boolean indicating if it's the last round.
    
    Returns:
    str: 'C' for cooperate, 'D' for defect.
    """
    # If it's the last round, always defect
    if is_last_round:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate threshold stock level (50% of capacity)
    stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    # Determine if previous defectors were more than half
    majority_defectors = previous_defectors > n / 2
    
    # If either condition is met, defect this round
    if majority_defectors or current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: The AI starts by cooperating in the first round to maintain a high stock level.
- **Responsive Adaptation**: After each round, the AI checks two conditions: whether more than half of the players defected last round and whether the current stock is below 50% of its capacity. If either condition is true, the AI defects to avoid being exploited or to maximize payoffs before depletion.
- **Endgame Maximization**: In the final round, the AI always defects to ensure it gets the maximum possible payoff without worrying about future consequences.

This strategy effectively balances cooperation and defection, ensuring the AI adapts dynamically to both the actions of others and the state of the resource.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe the stock's response.

2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: After each round, assess the stock level relative to capacity. Calculate the total consumption and determine if it's moderate (e.g., below 50% of capacity) or high.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - If consumption is moderate and the stock remains healthy, continue cooperating.
   - If consumption is high and the stock drops significantly, switch to defecting to protect your share.
   
4. **Trend Analysis**: In later rounds, analyze trends in stock levels. If the stock is increasing or stable, consider maintaining cooperation. If it's decreasing, defect more frequently.

5. **Last Round Strategy**: In the final round, always defect to maximize immediate gain since there are no future consequences.

6. **Threshold-Based Adjustments**: Implement thresholds, such as switching strategies if the stock drops below 50% of capacity. Revert to cooperation if the stock recovers.

This strategy balances exploitation and sustainability by adapting actions based on observed stock trends and opponents' indirect behavior through state changes, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round of a repeated game with perfect information about others' past actions, we can develop a strategy that balances immediate gains with future sustainability. The strategy considers both the current state of the resource (stock level) and the behavior of other players in previous rounds.

### Strategy:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.
   - **Previous Behavior:** If more than half of the players Defected in the previous round, Defect in this round.
   - **Stock Level:** Cooperate if the current stock is above a threshold (e.g., half of the capacity). Defect otherwise.

### Rationale:
- **First Round Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to encourage others to do the same and maintain resource levels.
- **Last Round Defection:** Maximizes immediate gain without concern for future depletion since no rounds follow.
- **Response to Others' Behavior:** If most players defected last round, defecting this round prevents being exploited.
- **Stock Level Consideration:** Cooperates when there's enough stock for sustainability but defects if the stock is low to secure remaining resources.

This approach ensures that the AI adapts to both environmental conditions and social cues, aiming to maximize total payoff over all rounds.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to observe others' initial behavior and set a baseline for stock dynamics.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - Calculate the average consumption per player from the previous round.
  - If the stock is below 50% of capacity, switch to defecting to maximize immediate gains, as others are likely over-exploiting.
  - If the stock is above 50% and most players cooperated previously, continue cooperating to sustain stock levels.
  - If the stock is high but many defected, consider defecting to capture more value without significantly harming future stocks.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

To address the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed a strategy that balances cooperation and defection to maximize payoffs while maintaining stock sustainability. The approach adapts based on observed behavior and current stock levels.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation Strategy (AES)

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to set a baseline of stock preservation.
2. **Adaptive Response**:
   - After each round, assess the total consumption relative to the game's capacity.
   - If the previous round's total consumption exceeds 75% of capacity, defect in the current round.
   - Otherwise, continue cooperating.
3. **Stock Level Consideration**: If the stock falls below 25% of capacity, switch to cooperation to facilitate regrowth, regardless of previous actions.
4. **Final Round Adjustment**: In the last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff, acknowledging that future rounds are not at risk.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**:
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of stock preservation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the total consumption from the previous round.
     - If total consumption > 0.75 * capacity, defect (D).
     - Else, cooperate (C).

3. **Stock Threshold**:
   - Monitor the current stock level after each round's regrowth.
     - If stock < 0.25 * capacity, switch to cooperation (C) until stock recovers above this threshold.

4. **Final Round**:
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

### Pseudocode:

```
function decide_action(previous_total_consumption, current_stock, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        if previous_total_consumption > 0.75 * capacity:
            action = "D"
        else:
            action = "C"

        if current_stock < 0.25 * capacity:
            action = "C"

        if round_number == total_rounds:
            action = "D"

    return action
```

### Strategy Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages stock sustainability and sets a cooperative tone.
- **Adaptive Response**: Adjusts based on others' behavior, defecting when exploitation is detected to avoid being taken advantage of.
- **Stock Threshold**: Prevents over-depletion by switching to cooperation when the stock is critically low.
- **Final Round Defection**: Maximizes immediate gain without compromising future rounds.

This strategy aims to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to the game's state and opponents' actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_343 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I will outline a structured approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy adapts based on game state and historical actions, ensuring robustness against diverse opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Overview:

The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoffs by dynamically adjusting between cooperation (C) and defection (D). It considers the current stock level, opponents' past actions, and the number of remaining rounds. The approach is adaptive, shifting towards exploitation as the game progresses or when the stock is depleted.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **Initial Round:**
   - Cooperate in the first round to observe others' behavior without immediately depleting resources.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Level Monitoring:** Continuously assess the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If the stock is above a defined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), consider cooperating if opponents have recently cooperated.
     - If the stock is below this threshold, defect to maximize immediate gains before potential depletion.

   - **Opponent Behavior Analysis:** Calculate a weighted average of opponents' cooperation rates, with more recent actions having higher weights. This helps identify trends towards cooperation or defection.
     - Cooperate if the majority of recent actions indicate cooperation and the stock is sustainable.
     - Defect if there's a noticeable trend towards defection or if the stock is low.

   - **Remaining Rounds Consideration:** As the game progresses, especially in later rounds, increase the tendency to defect. This ensures that you maximize payoffs when future impacts are less significant.

3. **Adaptive Thresholds:**
   - Use dynamic thresholds for cooperation and stock levels. For example, lower the cooperation threshold as the game nears its end, shifting focus from sustainability to exploitation.

4. **Stock Trend Analysis:** Monitor the trend of stock levels post-growth. If the stock is consistently decreasing, anticipate potential depletion and adjust strategy towards defection to secure remaining resources.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
Initialize:
    cooperation_threshold = 0.5  # Adjust based on testing
    stock_threshold = capacity / 2

First Round:
    Action = C

Subsequent Rounds (t from 2 to r):
    Calculate average_cooperation_rate using weighted recent history
    current_stock = state[t-1].stock_after_growth

    if current_stock > stock_threshold and average_cooperation_rate > cooperation_threshold:
        Action = C
    else:
        Action = D

    Update strategy based on remaining rounds:
        adjust cooperation_threshold downwards as t increases

    Monitor stock trend for depletion signals to inform future decisions
```

### Conclusion:

This strategy balances the need to exploit current opportunities with preserving resources for future rounds. By adapting based on stock levels, opponents' actions, and remaining game duration, it aims to maximize individual payoffs while being robust against various strategies employed by others.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Threshold-Based Cooperation:** Cooperate if the current stock is above 50% of capacity; defect if below. This encourages maintaining the resource when it's plentiful and exploiting it when it's scarce.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a high initial stock and encourage others to do the same.
   - **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff, as future consequences don't matter after the last round.

3. **Adaptive Mechanism:**
   - Adjust the cooperation threshold dynamically based on observed behavior. If many players defected in previous rounds, lower the threshold to defect earlier in subsequent rounds.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
Initialize:
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round:
        action = Cooperate
    elif it's the last round:
        action = Defect
    else:
        previous_stock = get_previous_round_stock()
        if previous_stock > threshold:
            action = Cooperate
        else:
            action = Defect

    observe others' actions and update stock
    adjust threshold based on recent defection rates
```

This strategy balances exploitation with resource maintenance, adapting to both the game's state and opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_345 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round while maximizing payoffs and maintaining stock levels, we propose a strategy that balances exploitation and conservation based on historical behavior and current stock conditions. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate to initiate a cooperative tone and maximize sustainability from the start.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (excluding the last round):**
   - **Stock Check:** If the current stock level \( S \) is below half of the capacity (\( \text{capacity} / 2 \)), cooperate to help recover the stock.
   - **Historical Behavior Analysis:** Calculate the moving average cooperation rate over the last three rounds (or all available if fewer than three). If this rate exceeds 50%, defect to exploit others' cooperation; otherwise, cooperate.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

### Rationale

- **First Round Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation encourages initial sustainability and higher collective payoffs.
- **Stock Threshold Check:** Cooperating when stock is low prevents depletion and ensures future rounds have a viable stock level for payoffs.
- **Moving Average Cooperation Rate:** By focusing on recent behavior, the strategy adapts to changing dynamics among players, promoting responsiveness without being overly reactive to isolated incidents.
- **Last Round Defection:** Maximizes immediate gain without concern for future stock levels, as there are no subsequent rounds.

### Expected Outcome

This strategy aims to balance higher payoffs through strategic defection when others cooperate with conservative cooperation to maintain a healthy stock level. It adaptively responds to group behavior and stock conditions, potentially leading to a high total payoff across all rounds while avoiding premature depletion of resources.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_346 = '''
To design an effective and exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that maximizes individual payoff while considering the dynamic state of the stock and the actions of other players. Here’s how the strategy can be structured:

### 1. Decision Rules
- **First Round**: Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation serves as a probing mechanism to gauge others' behavior without immediately signaling aggression.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Observe the previous round's stock level and the number of players who defected (D) or cooperated (C).
  - If the majority of players defected in the previous round, defect in the current round. This rule punishes defectors and discourages excessive exploitation.
  - If the majority cooperated, cooperate to sustain the stock for future rounds.
  - **Stock Threshold**: If the stock falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to cooperation regardless of others' actions. This ensures the stock can recover and maintain long-term payoffs.
- **Last Round**: Always defect (D). In the final round, there’s no future stock to protect, so maximize immediate payoff.

### 2. Edge Cases
- **First Round**: Start with cooperation to observe others' initial moves without triggering immediate retaliation.
- **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), prioritize cooperation to allow stock recovery, even if it means sacrificing short-term gains.
- **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there’s no future consequence for over-harvesting.

### 3. Exploitative Mindset
The strategy aligns with an exploitative approach by:
- Initially probing others' behavior through cooperation.
- Mirroring the majority's actions, rewarding cooperation and punishing defection.
- Preserving stock health to ensure sustained payoffs while exploiting opportunities for higher gains when others are cooperative.

### Pseudocode (for Implementation)
```python
def exploit_strategy Parameters(n, r, capacity, history):
    if no history:
        action = 'C'  # First round: Cooperate
    else:
        previous_stock = history['stock'][-1]
        prev_actions = history['actions'][-1]
        
        num_defect = sum(1 for a in prev_actions if a == 'D')
        majority = 'D' if num_defect > n/2 else 'C'
        
        # Stock threshold check
        if previous_stock < 0.2 * capacity:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            if current_round == r:  # Last round
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = majority
                
    return action
```

### Summary
This strategy is adaptive and robust, balancing exploitation with sustainability. It starts cooperatively to test the waters, mirrors others' behavior to exploit tendencies, preserves stock health when necessary, and maximizes gains in the final round.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_347 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll focus on balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability through adaptive decision-making based on observed behavior and stock levels.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation

**1. First Round Decision:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to encourage others to do the same, setting a cooperative tone and gathering initial data on others' behaviors.

**2. Subsequent Rounds Decision:**
   - **Monitor Past Behavior:** Track the average cooperation rate of other players over previous rounds.
   - **Stock Level Check:** Assess the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If the stock is above 50% of capacity and a significant number of others are cooperating, switch to Defect (D) to exploit higher immediate payoffs while maintaining a sustainable stock level.
     - If the stock drops below 50% or if many players are defecting, continue Cooperating (C) to help replenish the stock for future rounds.

**3. Last Round Decision:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** In the final round, prioritize immediate gain since there's no future impact on the stock.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, current_stock, history, is_last_round):
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return "C"
    
    avg_cooperation = sum([1 for actions in history if actions.count('C') / n >= 0.5]) / len(history)
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    
    if is_last_round:
        return "D"
    
    if stock_ratio > 0.5 and avg_cooperation > 0.5:
        return "D"  # Exploit when others cooperate and stock is healthy
    else:
        return "C"  # Conserve when stock is low or others defect

# Example usage in a round
action = adaptive_exploitation(n, capacity, current_stock, history, is_last_round)
```

### Explanation

- **First Round Cooperation:** Sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of others' initial moves.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Adjusts strategy based on stock health and collective behavior, balancing exploitation with conservation.
- **Stock Conservation:** Cooperates when the stock is low to ensure future payoffs are not compromised.
- **Exploitation When Safe:** Defects when conditions allow for higher gains without jeopardizing sustainability.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, adapting dynamically to the game's state and opponents' actions.

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to observe others' initial moves without depleting the stock.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - If it's the last round, Defect to maximize immediate payoff.
  - Calculate the average of opponents' past actions (C or D).
  - Assess current stock level and growth potential.
  - Compare expected payoffs for Cooperate vs. Defect based on current state and opponent behavior.
  - Use dynamic thresholds to decide action: Cooperate if stock is low or opponents are mostly Cooperating; Defect otherwise.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to gauge others' strategies.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to Cooperation if stock falls below a certain threshold to encourage regeneration.
- **Last Round:** Defect to secure maximum immediate payoff as future rounds don't matter.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
- Continuously monitor opponents' actions and adjust strategy dynamically.
- Balance between exploiting current gains and preserving stock for future use through adaptive thresholds.
- Occasionally defect when beneficial, considering both current state and opponents' likely reactions.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
if round == 1:
    action = Cooperate
elif round == total_rounds:
    action = Defect

    else:
        action = Cooperate
adjust thresholds based on observed outcomes

**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Forgiveness (ACF)**

**1. Initial Action:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and encourage others to do the same.

**2. Monitoring and Adaptation:**
- Track each player's cooperation ratio, defined as the proportion of times they've cooperated in previous rounds.
- Classify other players based on their recent behavior:
  - **Cooperative Players:** Those with a cooperation ratio above a threshold (e.g., 70%).
  - **Defective Players:** Those below this threshold.

**3. Decision Rules:**
- If most players are cooperative, continue cooperating to maintain the stock.
- If a significant number of players defect (based on a threshold), switch to defecting to protect your payoff and penalize non-cooperators.
- After a period of defection by others, if they start cooperating again, gradually revert to cooperation.

**4. Stock Level Consideration:**
- **High Stock (Near Capacity):** Cooperate to sustain the stock for future rounds.
- **Low Stock:** Even if others defect, consider cooperating to help recover the stock, ensuring long-term sustainability.

**5. Forgiveness Mechanism:**
- Allow a window for players who have defected to change their behavior before retaliating again.
- This encourages cooperation and allows the stock to recover.

**6. Endgame Strategy:**
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate gain since there are no future consequences.

This strategy balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to others' behaviors and the game's state, promoting cooperation while protecting against exploitation.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and encourage others to do the same, maximizing initial stock sustainability.
   - **Last Round:** Defect if the current stock is above 25% of capacity; otherwise, cooperate to preserve some stock for the final round's payoff.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level and opponents' past actions to adapt strategy, ensuring maximum personal gain while maintaining resource sustainability.

     - If the stock level drops below 50% of capacity, switch to Defect (D) to prevent further depletion.
     - Analyze the number of defections in the previous round. If more than half defected, choose D; otherwise, continue with C.
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - When n=2, be cautious and defect only if the opponent defected in the previous round to avoid mutual depletion.
   - If the stock is at capacity, continue cooperating to maintain sustainability unless others defect.

3. **Exploitative Approach**:
   - Exploit cooperation by defecting when others do, ensuring not to be the only one sacrificing payoffs.
   - Balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on recent actions and stock levels.

This strategy ensures adaptability, punishes defection, and maximizes payoff in the endgame, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_352 = '''
To address the problem of determining when to Cooperate or Defect in a repeated game where the stock changes based on players' actions, we can devise a strategy that combines initial cooperation with punishment for significant defection. Here’s a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate. This sets a cooperative tone and maximizes the stock if others also Cooperate.

2. **Monitor Stock Changes:**
   - After each subsequent round, observe the new stock level (Sₜ) and compare it with the previous stock level (Sₜ₋₁).

3. **Calculate Thresholds:**
   - Define a significant drop threshold, say 10%. If Sₜ is more than 10% less than Sₜ₋₁, it indicates potential significant Defection.

4. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - If the stock drops by more than the defined threshold in any round, switch strategy to Defect in the next round. This punishes perceived defection and deters future instances.

5. **Resume Cooperation:**
   - After punishing by Defecting once, return to Cooperating in subsequent rounds. This allows the system to reset and encourages others to revert to cooperation.

### Summary:

- **Round 1:** Cooperate.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - If stock drops >10% from previous round → Defect next round.
  - Else → Continue Cooperating.

This strategy promotes cooperation while deterring excessive defection through targeted punishment.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_353 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create a balanced approach that adapts based on observed behavior and the game's state, ensuring long-term payoffs without being overly exploited.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Reciprocity and Stock Management

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' initial moves without revealing defector tendencies early on.

2. **Monitor and Reciprocate:**
   - Track the number of defecting players each round.
   - If the majority (>50%) cooperated last round, continue cooperating.
   - If many defected (≥50%), switch to defection in the next round to avoid being exploited.

3. **Stock Level Thresholds:**
   - Cooperate if stock is above 75% of capacity; this preserves resources for future rounds.
   - Defect if stock drops below 25% of capacity to maximize immediate gains before potential depletion.
   - For intermediate levels (25-75%), decide based on others' recent actions—cooperate if most cooperated, else defect.

4. **Future Discounting:**
   - As the game progresses towards later rounds, introduce a slight bias towards defection to capture more payoffs before stock depletes further.
   - Adjust threshold for cooperation vs. defection dynamically based on remaining rounds and observed behavior.

5. **Randomized Cooperation:**
   - Introduce randomness (e.g., 10% chance) to sometimes cooperate even when expecting others to defect, preventing predictability and encouraging potential reciprocity.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
def strategy(stock, history, round_num, total_rounds):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "C"
    
    prev_actions = history[-1]
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
    
    # Determine main strategy based on previous actions
    if num_defectors > len(prev_actions) / 2:
        current_strategy = 'D'
    else:
        current_strategy = 'C'
    
    # Adjust based on stock level
    capacity = ...  # Game parameter
    stock_ratio = stock / capacity
    
    if stock_ratio >= 0.75:
        current_strategy = 'C'
    elif stock_ratio <= 0.25:
        current_strategy = 'D'
    
    # Future discounting in later rounds
    if round_num > total_rounds * 0.75:
        if random.random() < 0.1:  # 10% chance to defect more
            current_strategy = 'D'
    
    # Add randomness to avoid predictability
    if random.random() < 0.1:
        current_strategy = 'C' if current_strategy == 'D' else 'D'
    
    return current_strategy
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to encourage others and gather initial data.
- **Reciprocity:** Adjusts based on others' actions, promoting cooperation when possible and defecting to avoid exploitation.
- **Stock Management:** Uses thresholds to balance immediate gains with future resource availability.
- **Future Discounting:** Gradually shifts towards defection as the game nears its end to maximize remaining payoffs.
- **Randomization:** Adds unpredictability to deter opponents from exploiting a predictable pattern.

This strategy is robust and adaptive, aiming to exploit others' cooperation while safeguarding against excessive depletion of the common resource.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy designed is an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and stock levels. It aims to maximize long-term payoffs while being resilient to different opponent strategies.

### Decision Rules:
1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C) to initiate mutual cooperation, encouraging a sustainable start and building trust.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Previous Actions:** Track the number of players who defected in the last round.
   - **Threshold Check:** If more than 50% of players defected previously, switch to Defect (D). This prevents overexploitation and maintains stock levels.
   - **Stock Level Consideration:** If the current stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), defect to secure immediate gains before potential depletion.

3. **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
   - If fewer players defected after a defection round, gradually revert to cooperation over a few rounds to exploit renewed cooperative behavior.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Last Round:** Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future growth doesn't matter.
- **Low Stock Levels:** When stock is critically low, defect to ensure some payoff before depletion.

### Strategy Overview:
This approach starts cooperatively to foster a sustainable resource pool. It adaptively switches strategies based on others' actions and stock health, balancing between maintaining the resource and securing personal gains when others exploit excessively. The forgiveness aspect allows reengaging with cooperation if others return to it, ensuring robustness against varied behaviors.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    prev_actions = history[-1]
    defect_count = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
    stock_prev = history_stock[-1]
    
    threshold_defect = 0.5 * n
    
    if defect_count > threshold_defect or stock_prev < 0.25 * capacity:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Gradual forgiveness
        gradual_coop_rounds = 2
        if current_round % gradual_coop_rounds == 0:
            return 'C'
    
    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    
    return 'C' if defect_count <= threshold_defect else 'D'
```

This strategy ensures that the player adapts dynamically, exploiting cooperation when beneficial and defecting to protect against overexploitation, thus optimizing long-term payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_355 = '''
To design an effective exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that adapts based on the game's state and history. The strategy should aim to maximize individual payoffs by taking advantage of others' actions without relying on their cooperation.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Trends

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation helps maintain a high initial stock level, encouraging others to cooperate and setting a baseline for future decisions.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Stock Trends:**
     - Calculate the expected cooperative payoff each round as `coop_pay = S_t / (2n)`, where `S_t` is the current stock.
     - After observing the new stock level, compute the total consumption as `total_consumption = S_t - S_{t+1}_after_consumption`.
     - If `total_consumption > n * coop_pay`, it indicates that some players defected. Track this over recent rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds).
   - **Decision Rule:**
     - If defection is detected in more than half of the recent rounds, switch to defecting in the next round.
     - Otherwise, continue cooperating to sustain the stock.

3. **Final Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** In the last round, there's no future consequence for overconsumption, so maximize immediate payoff by taking `S/n`.

### Edge Cases and Considerations:
- **Stock Growth Dynamics:** Be aware of how stock replenishes. If the stock is low but growing significantly, consider the sustainability before defecting.
- **Adaptive Thresholds:** Use a nuanced approach to avoid overreacting; perhaps adjust based on the magnitude of stock decline rather than just the number of defections.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    elif current_round == r:
        return "D"
    
    else:
        # Calculate expected cooperative payoff in the last round
        S_last = history[-1]['stock_before']
        coop_pay_expected = S_last / (2 * n)
        
        # Determine total consumption in the last round
        stock_after_consumption = history[-1]['stock_after']
        total_consumption = S_last - stock_after_consumption
        
        # Check if others defected beyond cooperation level
        if total_consumption > n * coop_pay_expected:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

# Example usage in a round:
history = [...]  # List of previous rounds' data
action = strategy(n, r, capacity, history)
```

### Summary:

This strategy starts cooperatively to maintain the stock but switches to defecting if others consistently defect, ensuring maximum exploitation without depleting the resource prematurely. It adapts based on observed behavior and stock dynamics, making it robust against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_356 = '''
To determine whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D), an adaptive strategy balancing cooperation for resource sustainability and defection to avoid exploitation is optimal. Begin by cooperating and monitor stock levels post-growth. If the stock significantly decreases, switch to defecting until recovery signs emerge.

**Answer:**

Cooperate if the stock level is stable or increasing; defect if it decreases significantly, ensuring a balance between maintaining resources and avoiding exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_357 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock Levels**

1. **Initial Rounds (Early Game):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and observe others' behavior without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Stock Depletion Monitoring:**
   - Calculate the depletion level as `(Capacity - Current Stock) / Capacity`.
     - If **Depletion ≤ 25%**: Continue Cooperating (C). The resource is plentiful, and cooperation maintains sustainability.
     - If **25% < Depletion ≤ 50%**: Switch to Defecting (D). Moderate depletion indicates potential overuse; defecting secures higher payoffs before further decline.
     - If **Depletion > 50%**: Revert to Cooperating (C). Severe depletion warrants conservation to prevent resource collapse, ensuring some future payoffs.

3. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** In the final round, maximize immediate payoff since there's no future stock to preserve.

4. **Adaptation Based on Opponents' Behavior:**
   - Monitor the number of players defecting each round.
     - If a significant portion (e.g., more than half) are defecting, even with moderate depletion, switch to defecting to avoid being exploited.
     - If most cooperate when depletion is low, maintain cooperation to sustain the resource and mutual benefits.

**Pseudocode:**

```
def strategy(stock, capacity, history, current_round, total_rounds):
    depletion = 1 - (stock / capacity)
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    
    if depletion <= 0.25:
        cooperation_threshold = 0.5  # Adjust based on opponent behavior
        count_defectors = count_actions(history[-1], "D")
        if count_defectors > (n * cooperation_threshold):
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
    elif 0.25 < depletion <= 0.5:
        return "D"
    else:  # depletion > 0.5
        return "C"

# Helper function to count defectors in the last round's actions
def count_actions(history, action):
    if not history:
        return 0
    return sum(1 for act in history[-1] if act == action)
```

**Explanation:**
- The strategy begins cooperatively to encourage resource sustainability and observe others' tendencies.
- It adapts based on stock depletion levels to balance immediate gains with long-term resource health.
- In critical depletion phases, it prioritizes conservation to prevent collapse.
- Adjusts behavior based on opponents' actions to avoid exploitation while exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs when beneficial.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_358 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' reactions.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate from previous rounds.
     - If the average cooperation is high (>50%) and current stock is sufficient, defect (D) to exploit others' cooperation.
     - If cooperation is low or stock is low, cooperate (C) to sustain resource depletion for future gains.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Low Stock:** Cooperate more frequently to allow stock replenishment.
   - **Final Rounds:** Gradually increase defection as the game progresses, especially in the last few rounds, balancing immediate gain with sustainability.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - Continuously monitor others' actions and adapt strategy to exploit their tendencies without over-depleting the resource.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
Initialize:
    cooperation_threshold = 0.5
    stock_threshold = capacity / 2
    history = []

For each round from 1 to r:
    if round == 1:
        action = C
    else:

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:**  
To maximize individual payoff by adaptively exploiting opponents' behaviors while maintaining stock sustainability.

---

### **Decision Rules:**

1. **Cooperation Threshold (CT):**
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate of all players over the past rounds.
     - If the CT is above 70%, Cooperate (C).
     - If the CT is below or equal to 50%, Defect (D).
     - If between 50% and 70%, choose based on stock level:
       - **Stock Level:** If current stock > 75% of capacity, Cooperate; else, Defect.

2. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Track the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - **High Stock (≥75% capacity):** More inclined to Defect to maximize immediate gains without significant depletion risk.
     - **Low Stock (<25% capacity):** Prioritize Cooperate to conserve and allow growth.

3. **Adaptive Adjustments:**
   - Use a weighted average where recent rounds influence decisions more heavily, allowing quick adaptation to behavioral shifts.

4. **Round Count Consideration:**
   - **Remaining Rounds:** In later rounds, if stock is low, Defect to secure remaining resources; otherwise, continue adaptive strategy.
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage initial cooperation among others.
   - **Last Round:** If stock is critical (<25%), Defect to maximize immediate payoff; else, Cooperate.

---

### **Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1-3):** Start with Cooperation to foster a cooperative environment, monitoring others' actions closely for early signs of defection.
  
- **Mid-Game Adaptation:** Continuously update strategy based on opponents' recent actions and stock trends. If a significant number defect, shift towards Defection.

- **Late Game (Last 2 Rounds):** Assess remaining stock:
  - **Low Stock (<25% capacity):** Defect to capture any remaining resources.
  - **Adequate Stock:** Cooperate if others are cooperative; otherwise, Defect strategically.

---

### **Exploitative Mindset:**

- Exploit opponents' cooperation by occasionally defecting even when they cooperate, especially when stock levels allow it without causing significant depletion.
- Balance greed with sustainability to ensure future payoffs aren't jeopardized by short-term gains.

### **Pseudocode Implementation:**

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_364 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to balance the desire to maximize individual payoffs with the need to maintain a sustainable stock level over time. The strategy should be adaptive, robust, and exploitative, taking into account both the current state of the game (stock level) and the history of other players' actions.

### Strategy: **Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Sustainability**

#### Decision Rules:
1. **Initial Rounds (Exploration Phase):**
   - In the first few rounds (e.g., first 10% of total rounds), always cooperate (play C). This allows you to observe how other players behave and gauge their propensity to cooperate or defect without depleting the stock too early.
   
2. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - Track the stock level after each round. If the stock level falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to a more conservative strategy:
     - Cooperate (play C) in the next few rounds to allow the stock to recover.
     - If the stock continues to decline despite your cooperation, defect (play D) to maximize your short-term payoff.

3. **Exploitation Phase:**
   - After the initial exploration phase, calculate the average number of cooperators (C players) and defectors (D players) in previous rounds:
     - If the proportion of cooperators is high (>50%), defect (play D). This exploits the cooperative behavior of others while maximizing your payoff.
     - If the proportion of defectors is high (>50%), cooperate (play C). This helps maintain the stock level and avoids further depletion.

4. **Stock Growth and Payoff Maximization:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock growth formula: \( \text{New Stock} = S_{\text{remaining}} + 2 \times S_{\text{remaining}} \times (1 - S_{\text{remaining}}/\text{capacity}) \).
   - If the stock is growing at a rate that suggests sustainability, continue with the exploitation phase.
   - If the stock growth rate is negative or zero, defect (play D) to maximize your payoff before the stock depletes further.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the final rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds), always defect (play D). This maximizes your short-term payoffs since there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **First Round:**
   - Always cooperate (play C) in the first round to observe other players' initial actions without depleting the stock too early.

2. **Last Round:**
   - Always defect (play D) in the last round to maximize your payoff, as there are no future rounds to consider.

3. **Stock Depletion:**
   - If the stock level reaches zero at any point, always defect (play D) in subsequent rounds. This is because the stock cannot recover once it is depleted, and defecting maximizes your payoff in such scenarios.

4. **All Players Cooperate:**
   - If all other players cooperate consistently, continue to cooperate (play C). This maintains a high stock level and ensures long-term sustainability.

5. **All Players Defect:**
   - If all other players defect consistently, also defect (play D). This maximizes your payoff in the short term, as the stock will likely deplete regardless of your actions.

#### Exploitative Mindset:
The strategy is designed to exploit the behavior of other players while maintaining a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability. By cooperating initially and then adapting based on observed behavior, the strategy ensures that you maximize your payoffs without unnecessarily depleting the stock. The endgame strategy prioritizes short-term gains when there are no future rounds to consider.

### Pseudocode Example:
```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(game_params, game_state, history):
    n, r, capacity = game_params
    current_stock = game_state['stock']
    round_num = game_state['round']

    # Initial exploration phase (first 10% of rounds)
    if round_num < 0.1 * r:
        return 'C'
    
    # Last round
    if round_num == r:
        return 'D'
    
    # Calculate average cooperation rate from history
    avg_coop = sum(history['actions'].count('C') for _ in range(round_num)) / (round_num)
    
    # Monitor stock level and growth
    stock_growth = 2 * current_stock * (1 - current_stock/capacity)
    if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
        return 'C'  # Conserve stock
    
    # Exploitation phase
    if avg_coop > 0.5:
        return 'D'  # Exploit cooperators
    else:
        return 'C'  # Maintain sustainability
    
    # Edge case handling
    if current_stock == 0:
        return 'D'
    
    return 'C'
```

This strategy is designed to be robust and adaptive, ensuring that you maximize your payoffs while considering both the current state of the game and the behavior of other players.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_365 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy must adapt based on the game's state and history without assuming cooperation from others.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **First Round Decision:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of other players' initial actions without immediate depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Thresholds:**
     - **Low Stock (Below 20% of Capacity):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as the stock is critically low.
     - **High Stock (Above 80% of Capacity):** Cooperate to sustain the resource for future rounds while securing a decent payoff.
     - **Moderate Stock (20%-80% of Capacity):** Mirror the majority action from the previous round. If most players cooperated, cooperate; if most defected, defect.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Implement a "Tit-for-Tat" approach in moderate stock conditions. Punish defection by defecting in the subsequent round to deter excessive exploitation.

4. **Final Round Adjustment:**
   - **Action:** Always Defect.
   - **Rationale:** In the last round, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to preserve the stock for.

### Edge Cases and Considerations:
- **Initial Cooperation Risk:** While starting with cooperation may seem risky if others defect, it provides valuable information on others' tendencies.
- **Stock Depletion:** Aggressive defection when stock is low ensures not being left with nothing, even if it means contributing to depletion.
- **Adaptive Mirroring:** By mirroring previous actions, the strategy encourages reciprocity without being exploitable.

### Example Scenarios:
1. **All Cooperate:** High stock sustains, leading to continued cooperation.
2. **All Defect:** Rapid depletion leads to defection in subsequent rounds.
3. **Mixed Strategies:** Strategy adapts based on majority behavior, promoting a balance between exploitation and conservation.

This strategy effectively balances immediate gains with sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponents' actions without relying on their cooperation, making it robust against various behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_366 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed a comprehensive approach that adapts to both historical actions and current stock levels. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while ensuring the sustainability of the resource over multiple rounds.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Preservation

#### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to initiate a cooperative tone, encouraging others to follow suit and preserve the stock for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - **Defection Threshold**: Calculate the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than half of the players defected, choose to Defect (D) in the current round.
   - **Stock Level Consideration**: Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity. If the stock is below 50% of the capacity, Cooperate (C) to help replenish the resource.

3. **Last Round (r)**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds dependent on the current stock level.

#### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round**: Start with cooperation to set a positive precedent and avoid initial depletion.
- **Stock Depletion**: If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, prioritize cooperation to allow recovery and sustain future payoffs.
- **Last Round Strategy**: Focus solely on maximizing immediate gain by defecting, as there's no need to preserve the resource beyond this round.

#### Rationale:

- **Adaptation**: The strategy adjusts based on historical actions and current state, ensuring responsiveness to others' behaviors and resource conditions.
- **Exploitation**: By defecting when others are doing so, it prevents being exploited while taking advantage of cooperative players.
- **Robustness**: Handles various scenarios without relying on specific coordination, making it resilient against different opponent strategies.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategyParameters(n, r, capacity):
    history = []
    
    for round in 1 to r:
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            previous_actions = history[-1]
            num_defections = sum(1 for act in previous_actions if act == 'D')
            
            # Check stock level
            current_stock = get_current_stock()
            stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
            
            # Determine action based on history and stock
            if num_defections > n/2:
                action = 'D'
            elif stock_ratio < 0.5:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D' if round == r else 'C'
                
        history.append(action)
        execute_action(action)
```

### Conclusion:

This strategy effectively balances exploitation and preservation by adapting to both the actions of others and the health of the common resource. It ensures that while maximizing immediate gains, it also considers future payoffs, making it a robust and effective approach in competitive scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_367 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we can structure our approach around the following key insights and principles:

### Key Insights:
1. **Exploitation vs. Conservation Trade-off**: The strategy must balance exploiting current gains through defection (D) while conserving the stock for future rounds.
2. **Adaptation to Opponent Behavior**: The strategy should adapt based on the observed actions of other players to avoid being exploited by widespread defection.
3. **Stock Dynamics**: The stock level and its growth dynamics play a crucial role in determining the sustainability of cooperation or exploitation.

### Strategy Design:

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Initial Rounds (First Round)**: Cooperate (C). This sets an initial cooperative tone and allows us to observe others' behaviors without immediately exploiting.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - **Stock Level Threshold**: If the current stock level is below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to Cooperate (C) to allow the stock to recover.
  - **Opponent Behavior Monitoring**: Track the number of defections in previous rounds. If the proportion of players defecting exceeds a certain threshold, increase our own defection rate.
- **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) since there's no future payoff concern.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round**: Start with Cooperate to observe others' actions.
- **Low Stock Levels**: Switch to Cooperate if the stock is below a specified threshold to prevent depletion.
- **Last Round**: Maximize immediate gain by Defecting.

#### 3. Exploitative Mindset:
- The strategy should aim to exploit the cooperation of others while minimizing the risk of stock depletion.
- Adaptation based on both environmental factors (stock level) and opponent behavior ensures robustness.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def exploitative_strategy(n, capacity, r, history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate proportion of defections in the last k rounds
    recent_defections = count_defections(history)
    cooperation_threshold = 0.5  # Adjust based on desired sensitivity
    
    stock_level = get_current_stock()
    if stock_level < capacity * 0.5:
        return "C"
    
    if recent_defections > cooperation_threshold:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"

def count_defections(history):
    # Implement logic to count defections in recent rounds
    pass

def get_current_stock():
    # Implement logic to retrieve current stock level
    pass
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a baseline and allows observation of others' strategies.
- **Stock-Level Adaptation**: Switching to cooperation when the stock is low ensures sustainability, preventing future depletion.
- **Behavioral Adaptation**: Monitoring defections and adjusting our strategy accordingly prevents being exploited by others.
- **Last Round Exploitation**: Defecting in the final round maximizes immediate gain without concern for future repercussions.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, ensuring robust performance against a variety of opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_368 = '''
To address the challenge of deciding when to Cooperate or Defect in a repeated common-pool resource game, I propose an **Adaptive Cooperation Strategy** that balances maintaining the resource with responding to others' actions. This strategy considers both the social behavior of other players and the environmental state (current stock level).

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperate or Defect

#### Parameters:
- `n`: Number of players.
- `capacity`: Maximum stock level.
- `r`: Total number of rounds.
- `current_stock`: Current stock level at time `t`.
- `history`: Record of past actions (C/D for each player per round).

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**:
   - Action: Cooperate (C)

2. **Intermediate Rounds (t < r)**:
   a. Review the previous round's actions (`prev_actions`).
   b. Count `k`, the number of players who Defected in the previous round.
   c. If more than half defected (`k > n/2`) OR the stock is critically low (`current_stock < 0.5 * capacity`):
       - Action: Defect (D)
      d. Else:
           - Action: Cooperate (C)

3. **Last Round (t = r)**:
   - Action: Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

### Rationale:

- **First Round Cooperation**: Sets a cooperative tone and gathers initial information on others' tendencies.
- **Majority Rule**: If a majority defected last round, it signals potential exploitation, prompting a Defect this round to avoid being exploited.
- **Stock Threshold**: A stock level below 50% capacity indicates over-exploitation, necessitating Cooperation to allow regrowth for future rounds.
- **Last Round Defection**: Maximizes immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(t, current_stock, prev_actions, n, capacity, r):
    if t == 0:
        return "C"
    k = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == "D")
    stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    if (k > n / 2) or (current_stock < stock_threshold):
        if t == r - 1:  # Last round
            return "D"
        else:
            return "D"
    else:
        if t == r - 1:  # Last round
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
```

This strategy adaptively responds to both social cues and environmental conditions, aiming to balance cooperation with self-interest.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_369 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize payoffs while considering the game's dynamics. The approach is adaptive, monitoring both the stock level and other players' past actions to inform decisions.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to encourage a high initial stock and observe others' reactions.
2. **Monitor and Adapt**: Track the number of defectors in each round and the current stock level relative to capacity.
3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
   - **Stock Threshold**: If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, switch to defecting to secure higher immediate payoffs.
   - **Defection Threshold**: If more than 25% of players defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to avoid exploitation.
4. **Last Round Strategy**: In the final round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff since future stock is irrelevant.

### Detailed Decision Rules:

- **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and observe initial reactions.
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - If the current stock > 50% of capacity and ≤25% of players defected last round, cooperate.
  - Otherwise, defect to exploit current conditions or prevent further stock depletion.
- **Last Round**: Always defect (D) to maximize immediate gain.

### Handling Edge Cases:

- **Low Stock Levels**: When stock is critical, prioritize short-term gains by defecting.
- **High Defection Rates**: If many players are defecting, switch strategies to avoid being exploited.

This approach ensures the strategy is both exploitative and adaptive, responding effectively to the game's state and opponents' behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_370 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create a responsive approach that balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by monitoring opponents' actions and adjusting behavior accordingly.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over all rounds while ensuring resource sustainability to maintain future payoffs.

**1. Decision Rules:**

- **First Round (Round 1):**
  - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - **Rationale:** Encourage initial cooperation to establish a sustainable stock level and promote mutual benefit.

- **Intermediate Rounds (2 ≤ t < r):**
  - **Monitor Opponents' Actions:**
    - Track the number of players who Defected in the previous round.
  - **Calculate Cooperation Threshold:**
    - If ≥50% of opponents Defected last round, Defect this round to avoid being exploited.
    - If <50%, Cooperate to sustain the resource and encourage cooperation.
  - **Stock Level Consideration:**
    - If current stock is below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), Cooperate to allow recovery.
  
- **Last Round (Round r):**
  - **Action:** Defect (D)
  - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff as there are no future consequences.

**2. Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below a critical level, prioritize cooperation to prevent depletion.
- **High Defection Rates:** Switch to defecting if opponents are exploiting the resource excessively.

**3. Exploitative Mindset Integration:**
- Continuously monitor opponents' strategies and adjust actions to exploit their behavior while maintaining resource health.
- Periodically test cooperation levels by cooperating even when others defect, to encourage sustainability without being exploited.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(game_state):
    if game_state['round'] == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate on the first round
    
    prev_actions = game_state['previous_actions']
    num_defectors = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
    
    if num_defectors / len(prev_actions) >= 0.5:
        current_stock = game_state['current_stock']
        capacity = game_state['capacity']
        
        if current_stock < 0.25 * capacity:
            return 'C'  # Recover the stock
        else:
            return 'D'  # Exploit since many are defecting
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to sustain

if game_state['round'] == game_state['total_rounds']:
    return 'D'  # Defect in the last round
```

### Summary:

This strategy starts with cooperation to foster a sustainable environment, adapts based on opponents' actions by defecting when exploitation is rampant, and defects in the final round to maximize immediate gains. It balances exploitation with sustainability, ensuring long-term payoffs are maintained through adaptive decision-making.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_371 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create a balanced approach that combines initial cooperation with adaptive exploitation, while conserving resources when necessary. Here's the structured plan:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Conservation

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Encourage a cooperative environment from the start, potentially leading to higher collective payoffs.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Exploitation Threshold:**
     - Calculate the average payoff ratio from previous rounds (current round's cooperation level).
     - If this ratio exceeds 0.8, indicating significant cooperation by others, defect in the next round to exploit their cooperation.
   - **Stock Conservation Mechanism:**
     - Monitor the stock level after each round.
     - If the stock drops below 20% of capacity, switch to cooperation to allow regeneration and prevent depletion.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Without future consequences, maximize immediate payoff by defecting.

### Key Components:

- **Average Payoff Ratio Calculation:**
  - Each round, compute the ratio of actual average payoff to the maximum possible if all cooperated. This indicates the level of cooperation in the group.

- **Thresholds:**
  - **Exploitation Threshold (0.8):** If exceeded, defect next round.
  - **Stock Conservation Threshold (20% of capacity):** Below this, switch to cooperation.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - After each round, calculate the average payoff ratio and check stock level.
   - If the ratio is above 0.8 or stock is below 20%, cooperate next round; otherwise, defect.
3. **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize final payoff.

This strategy balances exploiting others' cooperation with conserving the resource for future rounds, adapting dynamically based on game state and history.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_372 = '''
The proposed strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game is designed to balance cooperation with strategic exploitation, ensuring both immediate gains and long-term sustainability of the common pool. Here's how it breaks down:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a high stock level, benefiting all players in subsequent rounds.

2. **Adaptive Threshold**: Monitor the stock depletion rate. If cumulative depletion exceeds 50% of capacity, switch to defecting to maximize personal gains before potential depletion.

3. **Punishment Mechanism**: Track opponents' defections. If at least a third defected recently, retaliate in the next round by defecting to deter future exploitation.

4. **Final Round Cooperation**: In the last round, cooperate to maximize personal payoff, assuming others do the same for mutual benefit.

This strategy is adaptive, punishes defectors, and handles edge cases effectively, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while aiming to exploit opportunities for higher payoffs.

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to maximize initial payoffs without over-depleting the stock.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - Calculate the average payoff per player from previous rounds.
     - If the average payoff is above 75% of (capacity / n), continue Cooperating. This indicates others are likely Cooperating, making it safe to do so.
     - If the average payoff falls below this threshold or if the stock level drops below 25% of capacity, switch to Defecting (D) to secure remaining resources and protect against depletion.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Start with Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation.
   - **Last Round:** If the stock is sufficiently high, Defect to maximize immediate payoff while considering future rounds' implications if applicable.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - Monitor both average payoffs and stock levels to adapt strategies dynamically.
   - Use historical data on payoffs and stock trends to inform decisions, ensuring a balance between maximizing current gains and preserving the resource for future rounds.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, adjusting based on the behavior of other players and the state of the common pool to optimize long-term payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_374 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and Round Progression**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to observe initial stock dynamics.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - If the current stock is below or equal to half of the capacity, defect (D).
     - If near the end of the game (specifically when the round number exceeds 80% of total rounds), defect regardless of stock level.
   - **Last Round:** Always defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Starts with cooperation to gauge stock behavior.
   - **Low Stock Situation:** Switches to defecting if the stock drops below 50% of capacity, ensuring resource capture before depletion.
   - **Endgame Strategy:** Defects in the final rounds and especially the last round to prioritize immediate gains over future sustainability.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - Balances between maintaining the resource for future use by cooperating initially and strategically defecting when necessary to exploit the stock, particularly as the game progresses or if the stock is depleted significantly.
   - Adapts based on observable state without relying on others' cooperation, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, current_round):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == r:
        return "D"
    else:
        threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        rounds_threshold = int(0.8 * r)
        if current_stock <= threshold or current_round > rounds_threshold:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

This strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by adaptively switching between cooperation and defection based on the stock level and game progression, ensuring both sustainability and strategic exploitation.

     - Calculate the **Cooperation Rate**: The percentage of players who cooperated in the previous round.
     - Assess the current **Stock Level** against predefined thresholds:
       - **Lower Threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity):** If stock is below this, Cooperate to allow growth.
       - **Upper Threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity):** If stock is above this, Defect to exploit surplus without significant harm.
     - Adjust actions based on Cooperation Rate and Stock Level:
       - If Cooperation Rate > 50%, continue Cooperating.
       - If Cooperation Rate ≤ 50%, switch to Defecting if Stock Level permits (above Lower Threshold).
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Start with cooperation to gauge others' behaviors.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate to ensure stock growth and sustainability.
   - **High Stock Levels:** Exploit by defecting when possible, ensuring not to deplete the stock excessively.
   - **Last Round:** Maximize payoff by defecting, as future consequences are irrelevant.

3. **Exploitative Mindset Integration:**
   - The strategy continuously adapts based on observed cooperation rates and stock levels, aiming to exploit current conditions for maximum gain while maintaining stock health for future exploitation.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against diverse opponent strategies by dynamically adjusting based on both the environment (stock) and social context (others' actions).

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and Opponent Behavior

def adaptive_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_number, r, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round_number == r:
        return "D"
    else:
        # Calculate number of defectors in the previous round
        prev_defectors = sum(1 for action in history[round_number-2] if action == 'D')
        if prev_defectors > n / 2:

# Usage example
n = 4
capacity = 100
current_stock = 62.5
round_number = 3
r = 10
history = [
    ['C', 'C', 'C', 'C'],  # Round 1 actions
    ['C', 'D', 'D', 'C']   # Round 2 actions
]

action = adaptive_strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_number, r, history)
print(action)  # Output: 'D'
```

### Explanation

- **First Round Cooperation**: Initiates cooperation to set a positive tone and maintain a high initial stock level.
- **Last Round Defection**: Maximizes immediate payoff in the final round without concern for future consequences.
- **Adaptive Behavior in Middle Rounds**:
  - **Defection Threshold**: If more than half of the players defected previously, the strategy switches to defection to avoid being exploited.
  - **Stock Level Check**: Cooperates if the stock is healthy (above 50% capacity) and defects if it's low, ensuring resource conservation when necessary.

This approach ensures that the strategy is both exploitative and sustainable, adapting effectively to various scenarios in the game.

**Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

To create an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource (CPR) game, we need a balanced approach that adapts to both the current state of the stock and the actions of other players. The goal is to maximize individual payoff while ensuring sustainable use of the resource over multiple rounds.

### Key Components of the Strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of others' initial actions without immediate exploitation.

2. **Stock Threshold-Based Decision Making:**
   - Monitor the stock level relative to the capacity.
     - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, Defect (D) to exploit surplus safely.
     - If the stock is between 25% and 75%, Cooperate (C) to maintain sustainability.
     - If the stock drops below 25%, Cooperate (C) to help replenish it.

3. **Reciprocity Mechanism:**
   - Track opponents' past actions. Calculate the average number of times others have defected in previous rounds.
     - If the average defection rate is above 50%, increase your own defection rate proportionally.
     - Reward cooperation by maintaining or increasing your cooperative actions if others are mostly cooperating.

4. **Final Rounds Adjustment:**
   - In the last 20% of rounds, shift towards defecting to maximize short-term gains, as future stock conservation becomes less critical.

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the stock is depleted (0), always Cooperate in subsequent rounds to allow regeneration.
   - Ensure that if the stock is critically low (<25%), prioritize conservation by cooperating, regardless of others' actions.

### Strategy Pseudocode:

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a cooperative precedent, allowing observation of others' strategies.
- **Stock Thresholds:** Ensure resource sustainability by adjusting actions based on current stock levels.
- **Reciprocity:** Adapts to others' behavior, rewarding cooperation and punishing defection proportionally.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment:** Maximizes immediate gains when future rounds are limited.
- **Edge Cases:** Handles critical situations like stock depletion responsibly.

This strategy balances exploitation with conservation, adapting dynamically to both the game's state and opponents' actions, aiming to optimize individual payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability.

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, cooperate (C) to encourage collaborative behavior among players.
   - **Stock Level Monitoring**: Continuously assess the current stock level relative to capacity. If the stock falls below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to defecting (D) to maximize immediate gains.
   - **Punish Defectors**: Evaluate past actions and payoffs. If there's evidence that other players are frequently defecting, indicated by high total consumption in previous rounds, adopt a defective strategy to counteract their exploitation.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Round**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff without future repercussions.
   - **Low Stock Levels**: Prioritize defecting when the stock is critically low to secure remaining resources.

3. **Exploitative Approach**:
   The strategy balances cooperation and defection, adapting based on observed behavior and stock dynamics. It aims to exploit others' cooperative tendencies while protecting against exploitation by switching tactics as needed.

This adaptive approach ensures robustness across various opponent behaviors, leveraging both the benefits of cooperation and the necessity of self-interest in resource management scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_379 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Action**: 
   - In the first round, Cooperate (C). This sets a baseline of initial cooperation and allows observation of other players' behaviors.

2. **Monitoring Cooperation Rate**:
   - Track the average cooperation rate of all players over the past few rounds (e.g., last 5 rounds). Calculate this as the proportion of times each player chose to Cooperate.
   
3. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - **Cooperate** if the average cooperation rate is above a threshold (e.g., 50%) and the current stock level is sufficient (above a defined threshold, say 25% of capacity).
   - **Defect** if the cooperation rate falls below this threshold or if the stock is low, indicating potential depletion.

4. **Stock Level Consideration**:
   - If the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to Defecting to maximize immediate payoff before further depletion.

5. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., final 10% of total rounds), always choose Defect (D) to maximize short-term gains, as future stock preservation is no longer a concern.

6. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the stock is extremely low in any round, prioritize Defecting to secure any remaining resources.
   - If historical data shows consistent Defection by others, increase tendency to Defect to avoid being exploited.

This strategy balances cooperation and exploitation, adapting based on collective behavior and stock health. It aims to sustain resources while opportunistically maximizing payoffs when others defect frequently or stock levels are precarious.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_380 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to encourage initial cooperation and observe others' behavior.
- **Middle Rounds (2 to r-1):**
  - If the number of defectors in the previous round exceeds half of the players (n/2), defect (D).
  - Alternatively, if the current stock is below 30% of capacity, defect (D) to secure a higher immediate payoff.
  - Otherwise, cooperate (C) to sustain the stock for future rounds.
- **Last Round (r):** Always defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below 30% of capacity, switch to defecting to avoid further depletion while securing a larger share.
- **Stock Depletion:** If the stock reaches zero, continue defecting as future payoffs will be zero regardless.

### 3. Exploitative Approach:
The strategy adapts based on opponents' recent actions and current stock levels, aiming to exploit others' defections while preserving resources when cooperation is viable.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```python
def exploitative_strategy(n, capacity, r, history, current_stock):
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return 'C'
    elif len(history) == r - 1:  # Last round
        return 'D'
    else:
        cooperation_threshold = n / 2
        stock_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
        
        previous_actions = history[-1]
        previous_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
        
        if previous_defectors >= cooperation_threshold or current_stock < stock_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

This strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, balancing immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_381 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can outline a responsive and adaptive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while considering both historical actions and current stock levels.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - **Cooperate (C):** Start by cooperating to avoid early depletion of the stock and encourage initial sustainability.

2. **Last Round Action:**
   - **Defect (D):** In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds do not matter.

3. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Majority Rule:** Observe the actions of all players in the previous round. If more than half defected, choose to Defect in the current round.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** Monitor the stock level after regeneration from the previous round. If it falls below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to Defecting to secure immediate gains, as future payoffs may be compromised.

4. **Adaptive Forgiveness:**
   - Introduce a mechanism where if a significant portion of players return to Cooperating after periods of Defection, gradually revert to Cooperating. This can prevent mutual defection leading to stock depletion.
   - Use a moving average or recent history (e.g., last 3 rounds) to assess the cooperation rate and adjust strategy accordingly.

5. **Stock Conservation:**
   - If the stock level is critically low, prioritize defecting to capture remaining resources rather than risking further depletion through cooperation without reciprocity.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def decide_action(round_number, previous_actions, current_stock, capacity):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif round_number == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate number of defectors in the last round
        defectors_last_round = sum(1 for action in previous_actions[-1] if action == 'D')
        cooperation_threshold = len(previous_actions[-1]) / 2
        
        # Check stock threshold
        stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
        if current_stock < stock_threshold:
            return 'D'
        
        # Determine based on majority action last round
        if defectors_last_round > cooperation_threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

# Example usage in a game context
action_history = []
for t in range(r):
    if t == 0:
        action = 'C'
    elif t == r-1:
        action = 'D'
    else:
        # Analyze previous actions and current stock
        defectors_last = sum(1 for a in action_history[t-1] if a == 'D')
        if defectors_last > n/2 or current_stock < 0.25*capacity:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            action = 'C'
    action_history.append(action)
```

### Strategy Rationale:

This strategy begins cooperatively to foster initial resource sustainability, then adapts based on others' actions and stock levels. By defecting when the majority does so or when the stock is low, it prevents being exploited while ensuring immediate gains. The last round defection maximizes payoff without regard for future consequences, striking a balance between cooperation and strategic exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_382 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' behavior.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Adaptation:**
   - Monitor opponents' actions from the previous round.
     - If ≥50% cooperated, continue cooperating to maintain stock health.
     - If <50% cooperated, switch to defecting (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Implement a "tit-for-tat" approach: if opponents defected in the previous round, defect this round to deter exploitation.

4. **Stock Threshold-Based Decision:**
   - Use stock level thresholds:
     - If current stock > 75% of capacity, cooperate.
     - If 50% ≤ stock ≤ 75%, mix strategy with a bias towards cooperation (e.g., 60% C, 40% D).
     - If stock < 50%, defect to secure payoffs before depletion.

5. **Final Round Strategy:**
   - In the last round, always defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as future rounds don't matter.

6. **Opponent Monitoring and Adaptation:**
   - Track opponents' historical behavior.
     - If a player frequently defects (>70% of their actions), increase defection rate against them.
     - Reward consistent cooperators by maintaining cooperation.

7. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If stock is near depletion (<10% capacity), defect to secure any remaining resources.
   - If all opponents are defecting, focus on maximizing individual payoffs through defection.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource sustainability, adapting dynamically based on opponents' actions and stock levels. It aims to exploit others by maximizing personal payoffs while maintaining the resource when beneficial.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_383 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating in the first round to encourage a cooperative environment and observe others' reactions.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - **Monitor Stock Trends**: Track whether the stock is increasing, decreasing, or stable after each round.
   - **Assess Defection Rate**: Calculate the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     - If a majority defected and the stock decreased, switch to Defecting in the next round to exploit the situation.
     - If the stock is stable or increasing with a high cooperation rate, continue Cooperating.

3. **Last Round Exploitation**: In the final round, always choose to Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

**Pseudocode Example**:
```python
Initialize strategy as Cooperate
stock_history = [capacity]
actions_history = []

for each round from 1 to r:
    if first round:
        action = 'C'
    elif last round:

    else:
        previous_stock = stock_history[-1]
        current_defections = count of 'D' in actions_history
        if current_defections > n/2 and previous_stock > new_stock:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            action = 'C'
    record action and update histories
```

This strategy balances cooperation to maintain resource sustainability with strategic defection to exploit when others defect, ensuring adaptability and robustness across various opponent behaviors.

   - **Opponent Behavior**: Check if at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round. If so, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect.

3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds, as there are no subsequent rounds to affect.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to balance cooperation and exploitation by adapting to both the game's state and opponents' behavior. Here's how it works:

1. **First Round:**
   - Always cooperate (C). This initiates a cooperative tone, encouraging others to reciprocate.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Until Last Round):**
   - **Monitor Opponents:** Track each player's defection rate.
   - **Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness:** If a player has defected more than 30% of the time, retaliate by defecting in the next round. This deters frequent defection without escalating unnecessary conflict.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If stock falls below 20%, switch to defecting (D) to secure remaining resources before depletion.

3. **Last Round:**
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future consequences.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation.
- **Last Round:** Prioritize short-term gain by defecting.
- **Low Stock:** Switch to defecting if stock is critically low.

This approach is robust, adapting to both the game's state and opponents' actions, aiming to maximize payoffs while maintaining flexibility to exploit opportunities as they arise.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_386 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource Game strategically, we'll employ an adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with retaliation against defectors while considering stock levels.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperate or Defect (ACD)

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate to initiate a cooperative tone and sustain the stock.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     1. Observe the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     2. If more than half of the other players defected last round, defect this round.
     3. If the stock level drops below a threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), always defect to maximize immediate payoffs.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Continue using the strategy based on historical behavior rather than blind defection, but if stock is low, defect.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize immediate payoff by defecting when sustainability isn't feasible.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
   - Cooperate to maintain high payoffs when others are cooperative.
   - Defect when others exploit, ensuring you're not taken advantage of and maintaining your payoff potential.

### Pseudocode:

```python
Initialize:
    threshold_defectors = 0.5  # More than half defected last round
    stock_threshold = capacity * 0.2  # Below this, always defect

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        proportion_defectors_last_round = number_of_defectors_last_round / (n - 1)
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        
        if proportion_defectors_last_round > threshold_defectors and current_stock > stock_threshold:
            action = 'D'
        elif current_stock <= stock_threshold:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            action = 'C'
```

This strategy adaptively responds to others' actions, promoting cooperation while protecting against exploitation.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_387 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitative Leader (AEL)**

**Objective:** Maximize personal payoffs while maintaining stock sustainability through adaptive cooperation and strategic defection.

---

### 1. Decision Rules:

- **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1 to r/2):**
  - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
  - **Reasoning:** Encourage initial cooperation to build a sustainable stock level, promoting a stable resource for future rounds.

- **Mid-Game Adaptation:**
  - Monitor the stock level and opponents' actions.
  - If the stock falls below 75% of capacity or if more than half the players Defected in the last round:
    - Switch to Defect (D) for the next round to exploit others' cooperation.

- **Stock Threshold Check:**
  - After each round, assess if the stock is above 50% of capacity.
    - If yes, continue with the current strategy (C or D).
    - If no, Cooperate in the next round to allow stock regeneration.

- **Late Game (Last 25% of Rounds):**
  - Defect (D) more frequently to maximize short-term gains as future rounds diminish in importance.
  
---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

- **First Round:**
  - Always Cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline and observe others' initial moves.

- **Low Stock Levels:**
  - If the stock drops below 30% of capacity, switch back to Cooperate for at least two consecutive rounds to facilitate recovery.

- **Last Round:**
  - Defect (D) to maximize final payoff without concern for future consequences.

---

### 3. Exploitative Approach:

- **Punishment Mechanism:** 
  - If opponents defect excessively, retaliate by defecting in subsequent rounds to discourage further exploitation while securing personal gains.

- **Recovery Phase:**
  - After retaliatory defection, monitor stock levels. If recovery begins, revert to cooperation to sustain long-term benefits.

### Explanation:

- **Adaptability:** The strategy adjusts based on recent stock levels and opponents' past actions.
- **Sustainability:** Cooperates when necessary to prevent stock depletion, ensuring future payoffs.
- **Exploitation:** Defects strategically to capitalize on others' cooperation without causing irreversible harm.

This approach balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_388 = '''
To maintain a sustainable resource level while maximizing personal gain, adopt the following strategy:

1. **First Round**: Choose to Cooperate (C). This minimizes impact and allows observation of the outcome.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Track the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, choose to Cooperate (C) to help replenish the stock.
   - If the current stock is above or equal to 50% of capacity, choose to Defect (D) to maximize personal gain.

This approach balances conservation when resources are scarce and allows for exploitation when resources are plentiful.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_389 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round of a repeated game with perfect information, we can formulate a strategy that balances cooperation with self-interest based on observed stock levels and remaining rounds. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Formulation:
1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C).
   - Start by cooperating to establish potential mutual cooperation.

2. For each subsequent round until the last:
   - Calculate the threshold \( T \) as \( T = \text{capacity} \times (\frac{\text{remaining rounds}}{\text{total rounds}}) \).
     - This ensures that earlier rounds have a higher threshold, encouraging cooperation to maintain stock for future use.
   - If current stock > \( T \): Cooperate (C).
   - Else: Defect (D).

3. **Last Round:** Always Defect (D).
   - Maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

This strategy encourages cooperation when the stock is sufficient relative to remaining rounds, ensuring sustainable use while allowing for strategic defection to maximize payoffs when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_390 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and Defection Levels**

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2 Rounds):**
   - Cooperate to observe others' behavior and allow the stock to grow.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (From Round 3 onwards):**
   a. **Monitor Previous Round's Actions:**
      - Count the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   
   b. **Determine Stock Level:**
      - Check the current stock level after growth from the last round.

   c. **Decision Rules:**
      - If the stock is above 70% of capacity AND fewer than half of the players defected last round:
          - Cooperate to sustain high stock levels.
      - Else:
          - Defect to exploit the situation, either because the stock is sufficient to handle higher consumption or enough others are defecting.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round (Round r):** Always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below 30% of capacity, cooperate to help replenish it for future rounds.

This strategy balances between exploiting higher payoffs when conditions are favorable and maintaining stock sustainability by cooperating when necessary. It adapts based on both the stock level and others' past actions, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_391 = '''

2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision-Making:**
   - After the first round, evaluate the previous round's outcomes:
     - **Stock Level Check:** Assess if the stock is above 70% of capacity.
     - **Cooperation Rate Check:** Determine if at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round.

3. **Decision Rules Based on Evaluation:**
   - If both the stock level is above 70% and at least half cooperated:
     - Cooperate (C) to maintain high stock levels for future rounds.
   - If the stock is below 30% of capacity OR a significant number defected:
     - Cooperate (C) to contribute to stock replenishment.
   - In other cases, especially when the stock is between 30-70%, and fewer than half cooperated:
     - Defect (D) to exploit current conditions for higher immediate payoffs.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 10% of total rounds), prioritize defecting (D) if the stock is sufficient, as future sustainability becomes less critical than immediate gain.

This strategy balances exploiting opportunities when safe and cooperating to maintain resource health for long-term benefits. It dynamically adapts based on both environmental factors and collective player behavior, ensuring robustness across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_392 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules**:
   - **Cooperate (C)** if both conditions are met:

   - **Defect (D)** otherwise, especially in the last round or when stock is below 50%.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **First Round**: Always Cooperate to maintain a high initial stock level.
   - **Last Round**: Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future benefit from cooperation.
   - **Low Stock**: If the stock drops below 20% of capacity, defect to capture remaining value.

3. **Adaptation**:
   - Monitor the trend of stock levels. If the stock is decreasing over time, indicating others are defecting, switch to Defect more frequently.
   - Adjust the cooperation threshold based on observed behavior: lower the stock threshold for cooperation if defection rates increase.

This strategy balances preserving the common resource with exploiting it when necessary, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_393 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that adapts to both the actions of other players and the current state of the stock. The strategy should aim to maximize individual payoffs while considering the sustainability of the resource across all rounds.

### Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **Initial Rounds (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation sets a baseline and encourages others to reciprocate, potentially leading to higher mutual payoffs early on.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Monitor Recent Defections:** Track the number of players who defected in the previous round.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** Determine if the current stock level is below a defined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
   - **Decision Rules:**
     - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, or if the stock is below the threshold, switch to defecting.
     - Otherwise, continue cooperating.

3. **Late Rounds (Rounds r-1 and r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** In the final rounds, especially the last one, there’s no future consequence for over-exploitation, making it optimal to maximize immediate payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, history, current_round):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round >= r - 1:  # Last two rounds
        return "D"
    else:
        recent_defections = count_defections(history[-1])
        stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        
        if (recent_defections / n) > 0.5 or current_stock < stock_threshold:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

def count_defections(prev_actions):
    return sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, the strategy encourages a cooperative environment that can sustain higher payoffs.
- **Adaptive Decision Making:** The strategy dynamically adjusts based on recent defections and stock levels. If too many players defect or the stock is depleted, it shifts to defecting to avoid being exploited.
- **Endgame Strategy:** In the final rounds, the strategy prioritizes immediate gains by defecting, as there are no future rounds to consider.

This approach balances exploitation with preservation, adapting to both the actions of others and the game's state to maximize overall payoffs.

  - Calculate the average payoff per player from the last round.
  - If the stock is below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), Cooperate to prevent depletion.
  - Employ a modified Tit-for-Tat strategy with forgiveness:
    - Cooperate if the majority of players Cooperated in the previous round.
    - Defect if the majority Defected, but occasionally forgive (Cooperate) to encourage cooperation.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize personal gain since future consequences are irrelevant.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to set a cooperative tone.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize stock recovery by Cooperating if stock is critically low.
- **Last Round:** Exploit the opportunity for maximum payoff without considering future repercussions.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
The strategy aims to exploit opponents' behavior by mirroring their actions, encouraging cooperation while protecting against excessive defection. It adapts based on both the current state of the stock and historical player actions, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and long-term resource sustainability.

---

This approach ensures the strategy is adaptive, robust, and aligned with an exploitative mindset, making it competitive in a tournament setting.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_395 = '''
To address the problem of balancing immediate gains with preserving resources for future rounds in a repeated game scenario, we can employ an adaptive strategy that adjusts based on both the stock level and opponents' previous actions. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a high initial stock level.
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - If the current stock is above half of its maximum capacity:
     - Defect (D) if at least half of the players defected in the previous round.
     - Otherwise, Cooperate (C).
   - If the current stock is below or equal to half of its maximum capacity:
     - Always Cooperate (C) to help recover the stock for future rounds.
3. **Last Round (Round r):** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start with cooperation in the first round to ensure a high initial stock level, setting a positive trajectory for subsequent rounds.
2. **Adaptive Decision Making:**
   - In middle rounds, monitor both the current stock and opponents' previous actions. This dual consideration ensures that decisions are informed by both resource availability and strategic positioning.
   - If the stock is healthy (above half capacity), the strategy adapts to others' aggression; defecting when many others have defected previously to avoid being exploited.
   - When the stock is depleted, cooperation is prioritized to replenish resources for future gains.
3. **Maximizing Final Payoff:** In the last round, with no future rounds at stake, defecting ensures the highest possible immediate gain, capitalizing on the remaining resource without concern for depletion impacts.

### Implementation
This strategy can be implemented using conditional checks based on the current stock level and historical data of opponents' actions. The logic is straightforward, making it suitable for automated decision-making in game-theoretic scenarios.

### Conclusion
By integrating both environmental (stock levels) and social (opponents' actions) cues, this approach optimizes for both immediate gains and sustainable resource use, providing a balanced and adaptive solution to the dilemma of cooperation versus exploitation.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Round:** Cooperate (C) to encourage others to cooperate and preserve the stock.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - Track the number of defections by other players and the trend of the stock level.
     - If the majority of previous actions were defections, switch to Defect (D).
     - Monitor the stock level. If it falls below a calculated threshold based on capacity and number of players, defect to maximize immediate gain.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize payoff since future rounds don't matter.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If stock is critically low, defect to ensure personal gain before depletion.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - Use opponents' past actions to inform current decisions.
   - Balance between preserving the stock for future rounds and exploiting it when others are not cooperating.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
Initialize:
    total_defections = 0
    previous_stock_trend = []
    
For each round from 1 to r:
    if round == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        calculate_threshold = (capacity / n)
        analyze_previous_actions:
            count_defections = number of D actions in last k rounds
        assess_stock:
            current_stock_level = S
            stock_trend = check if current_stock_level is increasing or decreasing
        
        if count_defections > (n/2) or current_stock_level < calculate_threshold:
            action = D
        else:
            action = C
    
    record own_action
    update total_defections and previous_stock_trend

After all rounds, return total payoff.
```

This strategy adaptively switches between cooperation and defection based on opponents' behavior and stock health, aiming to exploit others while preserving resources for future gains.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_397 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Sustainability**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish a healthy stock level.

2. **Stock Thresholds**:
   - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, defect to maximize immediate gain while the stock is sustainable.
   - If the stock falls below 50% of capacity, cooperate to help replenish it for future rounds.
   
3. **Mid-Range Adaptation**: For stock levels between 50%-75%, assess the previous round's cooperation rate. If more players defected, switch to defecting; otherwise, continue cooperating.

4. **Last Round Exploitation**: In the final round, defect to secure maximum immediate payoff without concern for future stock.

This strategy balances exploiting high stock levels with conserving when necessary, ensuring long-term sustainability while adapting to others' actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_398 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Initial Consideration:**
- **First Round:** Start with Cooperate (C) to observe others' reactions without immediately depleting the stock.

**2. Punishment Mechanism:**
- Monitor the number of Defects each round.
- If over-exploitation is detected (exceeding a threshold of average payoffs indicating too many Ds), reduce consumption or defect strategically to influence others' behavior.

**3. Greed Detection:**
- Track the number of Defects and average payoffs per round.
- Use these metrics to identify if others are being greedy, adjusting your strategy accordingly.

**4. Adaptive Thresholds:**
- Set a stock level threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity) to determine when to switch strategies.
- If stock is below this threshold, Cooperate to allow regeneration; otherwise, consider defecting based on others' actions.

**5. Long-Term vs Short-Term Balance:**
- Focus on immediate payoffs while maintaining future sustainability by not over-exploiting excessively.

**6. Last Round Consideration:**
- In the final round, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

**7. Defection Clamp:**
- Limit consecutive Defections based on stock levels and others' behavior to prevent over-depletion.

**8. Learning from History:**
- Adjust strategy each round using past actions and outcomes, exploiting Cooperators by defecting more if safe.

**9. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Start with C; observe.
- **Last Round:** Switch to D for maximum payoff.

**10. Robustness:**
- Maintain adaptability across varying opponent behaviors without assuming cooperation or patterns.

This strategy dynamically reacts to others' actions and stock levels, balancing exploitation with sustainability, ensuring robust performance against diverse behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_399 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we'll create a rule-based approach that adapts to both the current state and historical actions. The strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize payoffs without assuming others' cooperation.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on History and State

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation sets a baseline, encouraging others to reciprocate while allowing observation of their behavior.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - **Historical Defection Check**: Track the number of players who defected in the previous round (D_prev).
     - If D_prev ≥ n/2, choose Defect (D) in the current round.
   - **Stock Level Threshold**:
     - If the stock level S is below a threshold (e.g., capacity / 2), switch to Defect (D) to secure higher payoffs before potential depletion.
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).

3. **Last Round Action (Round r)**:
   - Always choose Defect (D). With no future rounds, maximizing immediate payoff is optimal.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Encourages others to cooperate and provides insight into their strategies.
- **Adaptive Response**: By tracking defections, the strategy punishes non-cooperative behavior, preventing exploitation.
- **Stock Conservation**: Defecting when stock is low protects against depletion, ensuring future payoffs.
- **Final Round Maximization**: No holds barred in the last round to secure maximum payoff.

### Pseudocode

```python
def adaptive_strategy(n, r, capacity, history, current_stock):
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return 'C'
    elif r == 1:           # Only one round (though per parameters r>1)
        return 'D'
    else:
        last_actions = history[-1]
        D_prev = sum(1 for action in last_actions if action == 'D')
        
        if r - len(history) == 1:  # Last round
            return 'D'
        
        threshold = capacity / 2
        
        if D_prev >= n/2:
            return 'D'
        elif current_stock < threshold:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Conclusion

This strategy dynamically adjusts between cooperation and defection, leveraging historical actions and stock levels to maximize payoffs. It starts cooperatively, adapts based on others' behavior, conserves when necessary, and optimizes in the final round, ensuring robustness against a range of opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_400 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in a repeated game where players' actions affect a shared resource (the stock), we can adopt a strategy that balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy: Balanced Cooperation and Defection

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to help build up the stock, encouraging others to do the same and maintaining a high initial resource level.

2. **Monitor Stock Trends**: After each round, observe whether the stock after growth (S_t) is higher or lower than the previous round's starting stock (S_{t-1}). This helps determine if total consumption was sustainable.

3. **Adaptive Response**:
   - If the stock after growth is decreasing compared to the previous round, switch to Defecting. This indicates that others are over-exploiting the resource.
   - If the stock remains stable or increases, continue Cooperating to maintain sustainability.

4. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final 10% of rounds (as r approaches its limit), always choose to Defect. This maximizes immediate payoffs since future rounds become less significant.

### Summary

- **Early Rounds**: Cooperate to build a high stock level.
- **Mid Game**: Adjust based on observed stock trends; defect if the stock decreases, cooperate otherwise.
- **Late Game**: Defect in the last few rounds to maximize gains.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, aiming to maintain resource sustainability while exploiting opportunities when necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_401 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round of a repeated game, we need a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The solution must adapt based on others' actions and the current state of a shared resource (stock). Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Outline

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C).
   - Start by cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and maximize initial joint payoff.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - Calculate the average number of defections by other players in all previous rounds.
     - Let `avg_defect` be the ratio of total defections by others to the maximum possible (number of players minus one times the number of previous rounds).
   - Check the current stock level after the last round's growth.
     - If the stock is below a threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), Cooperate to allow regrowth.
   - Otherwise, if `avg_defect` > 50%, Defect; else, Cooperate.

3. **Final Round (r)**: Always Defect (D).
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff since there are no future consequences for stock depletion.

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and avoids immediate conflict.
  
- **Adaptive Strategy**: By monitoring others' defections, the strategy reacts to exploitation. If others defect frequently, it's optimal to defect to avoid being taken advantage of.

- **Stock Sustainability**: When the stock is critically low, cooperating ensures some regrowth for future rounds, preventing complete depletion that could hurt all players.

- **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, with no future repercussions, defecting maximizes one's own payoff regardless of others' actions, leveraging the classic prisoner's dilemma outcome.

### Conclusion

This strategy effectively balances between immediate self-interest and long-term resource management, adapting dynamically to both the actions of others and the state of the shared stock.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_402 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate to establish a high initial stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Except Last)**:
   - If the current stock is below 30% of capacity: Cooperate to allow stock recovery.
   - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round and the stock is above 30%: Defect to exploit their actions without severe depletion.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate to maintain a sustainable stock level.

3. **Last Round Action**: Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

This strategy balances cooperation to sustain resources with opportunistic defection when others defect or in the final round, ensuring exploitative yet adaptive behavior.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_403 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round to maximize payoffs while maintaining the stock for future exploitation, we've developed a strategy that balances reacting to both the environmental state (stock level) and others' recent behavior. Here's how it works:

### Strategy:
1. **First Round**: Cooperate.
   - Start by cooperating to help establish a high initial stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (until the last round)**:
   - **Determine Others' Recent Actions**: For each player, check if they defected in the previous round using their payoff and the previous stock level.
   - **Calculate Defection Rate**: Count how many players defected last round.
   - **Decision Making**:
     - If more than half of the players defected last round, defect this round to avoid being exploited.
     - If the current stock is above 70% of capacity, defect to exploit the high stock without causing immediate depletion.
     - If the current stock is below 20%, cooperate to help recover the stock.
     - Otherwise, continue cooperating unless evidence suggests otherwise.

3. **Last Round**: Always Defect.
   - Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

### Explanation:
- **Reacting to Others' Behavior**: By checking if many players defected in the previous round, we avoid being taken advantage of and instead join in defecting when it's likely profitable.
- **Stock Level Management**: Cooperating when the stock is low helps ensure there’s enough for future rounds. Defecting when the stock is high allows exploitation without causing significant depletion.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: The first round sets a cooperative tone, while the last round prioritizes immediate gain.

This balanced approach aims to maximize payoffs while maintaining the stock's health for as long as beneficial.

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - The strategy is adaptive, balancing between exploiting others' cooperation and conserving the stock when necessary.
   
   **a. First Round:**
      - Cooperate (C) to maximize initial stock growth.

   **b. Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1):**
      - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect (D) as punishment.
      - Otherwise, check the current stock level:
         - If the stock is below 20% of capacity, cooperate (C) to conserve.
         - Else, defect (D) to exploit others' cooperation.

   **c. Last Round (r):**
      - Always defect (D), unless the stock is zero, in which case the action doesn't matter but defecting is chosen by default.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative baseline.
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff through defection.
   - When the stock is critically low (below 20% of capacity), switch to cooperation to facilitate recovery.

**3. Exploitative Mindset:**

**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

The strategy is designed to be exploitative, adaptive, and robust against various opponent behaviors in a repeated, simultaneous-move game. The key components are:

1. **Initial Rounds**:
   - **Round 1**: Start with a mix of cooperation and defection (e.g., defect once) to test others' reactions without immediate stock depletion.
   - **Subsequent Rounds**: Transition based on stock levels and opponents' actions.

2. **Stock-Level Dependency**:
   - Use a threshold-based approach: Cooperate if the stock is below 75% of capacity, otherwise defect to exploit surplus.
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on previous rounds' outcomes to balance exploitation and conservation.

3. **Reciprocal Play**:
   - Track opponents' defections from the last round. If the number of defectors exceeds a threshold (e.g., 50%), increase defection rate in the next round as punishment.
   - Apply a forgiveness mechanism by gradually reducing punitive actions if cooperation resumes.

4. **Adaptation Mechanisms**:
   - Continuously monitor stock levels and adjust thresholds to ensure sustainable exploitation without depleting resources.
   - Use a moving average of past defections to smooth out reactions to opponents' behavior.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Last Round**: Consider defecting if others are doing so, but balance with potential immediate gains versus future losses (though no future rounds remain).
   - **Low Stock Levels**: Prioritize cooperation to allow stock regeneration for future payoffs.

6. **Growth Dynamics Consideration**:
   - Account for stock growth after each round. Higher remaining stock leads to better regrowth, influencing strategy adjustments.

This hybrid approach combines exploitation with conservation, adapting based on both the environment and opponents' actions to maximize long-term payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability.

1. **First Round Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to observe others' actions and allow the stock to build up without initial depletion.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Strategy**:
   - Calculate the cooperation rate (C_rate) as the average number of cooperations per player across all previous rounds.
   - If C_rate exceeds 50% and the current stock is above half of its capacity, choose to Defect to exploit others' cooperative behavior without causing significant harm.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate to help replenish or maintain the stock.

3. **Last Round Exploitation**: In the final round, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.

This strategy ensures that you take advantage of high cooperation levels and robust stock conditions while conserving when necessary, balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we focus on balancing cooperation to preserve the stock and defecting to exploit when necessary. The approach is adaptive, adjusting based on observed stock levels and past actions.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C)
   - Start by cooperating to set a cooperative tone and preserve initial stock levels for future rounds.

2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - **Stock Trend Monitoring**: Track the stock level after each round. If the stock has decreased for two consecutive rounds or falls below 50% of capacity, switch strategy to Defect (D).
   - Continue cooperating if the stock remains stable or increasing, indicating others are likely cooperating.

3. **Last Round**: Always Defect (D)
   - Maximize immediate payoff in the final round since there's no future stock to preserve.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Check if it's the last round
    if current_round == r:
        return "D"
    
    # Determine if stock has decreased for two consecutive rounds or below threshold
    stock_history = [h['stock_after'] for h in history]
    recent_stocks = stock_history[-2:]
    
    if len(recent_stocks) < 2:
        # Not enough data, continue previous action
        return history[-1]['action']
    
    decreasing = (recent_stocks[0] > recent_stocks[1])
    below_threshold = (recent_stocks[-1] < 0.5 * capacity)
    
    if decreasing and below_threshold:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"

# Example usage
history = [...] # List of previous round data including 'stock_after' and 'action'
n = 4
r = 10
capacity = 100

current_action = strategy(n, r, capacity, history)
print(current_action)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy begins with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and resource preservation.
- **Adaptive Switching**: By monitoring the stock's trend over consecutive rounds, the strategy detects when others may be defecting and switches to exploitation to avoid being disadvantaged.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Defecting in the last round ensures maximum personal gain without future repercussions.

This approach is robust against varying player behaviors, ensuring both preservation of resources when possible and strategic exploitation when necessary.

   - **Stock Threshold:** Monitor the current stock level. If it falls below a threshold (e.g., capacity divided by 2), begin defecting to maximize immediate gains, as sustainability becomes less critical.

3. **Last Round Strategy:**

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff over all rounds by balancing immediate gains with sustainable stock management.

**Strategy Overview:**
1. **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a high initial stock level, promoting future sustainability.
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** Use a threshold-based approach considering the current stock and historical player actions.

**Decision Rules:**

- **Threshold Calculation:** Set a stock threshold at 70% of capacity. If the current stock exceeds this, prioritize immediate gain; otherwise, focus on sustainability.
  
- **Historical Adaptation:** Monitor the average number of defections in previous rounds. If significant, adjust towards cooperation to prevent stock depletion.

**Pseudocode:**

```
Initialize:
    total_stock = capacity
    defect_threshold = 0.7 * capacity
    avg_defections = 0

For each round from 1 to r:
    if round == 1:
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        previous_avg_defection = avg_defections / (round - 1)
        if total_stock > defect_threshold and previous_avg_defection < 0.5:

**Edge Cases:**

- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.
- **Low Stock:** If stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), switch to Cooperate to allow regeneration.

This strategy adaptively balances cooperation and defection, ensuring sustainable resource use while exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs when safe. It leverages historical data and current state to make informed decisions, optimizing total payoff over the game duration.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_410 = '''
To address the strategic challenge posed by the Common Pool Resource Game, we propose a strategy that balances cooperative behavior with targeted punishment, adapting dynamically to maintain a healthy stock level while exploiting opponents effectively. Here’s how the strategy is structured:

### Strategy: Adaptive Punisher with Stock Conservation

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to establish a baseline of trust and observe others' behaviors without immediate depletion.

2. **Monitor and Adapt Post-Round 1:**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** Calculate the number of players who cooperated in the previous round. If more than half (threshold = n/2) cooperated, continue cooperating.
   - **Punishment Mechanism:** If fewer than half cooperated, switch to defecting for the next two rounds as a form of punishment.

3. **Stock Level Adjustment:**
   - **Conservation Threshold:** Set a minimum stock level (e.g., 20% of capacity). If the stock falls below this threshold, prioritize conservation by cooperating until the stock recovers above the threshold.
   - **Dynamic Adaptation:** Continuously monitor the stock level and adjust the cooperation/defection strategy to prevent depletion while maximizing payoffs.

4. **Final Round Strategy:**
   - **Endgame Defection:** In the last round (r), defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future consequences for defection.
   - **Rationale:** Without future rounds, the temptation to defect is higher, and immediate gain outweighs long-term cooperation benefits.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python

```

### Rationale and Benefits

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages trust and sets a high initial stock level for future rounds.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** Deters excessive defection by imposing consequences on the stock, encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Stock Conservation:** Prevents depletion by switching strategies when the stock is low, ensuring sustainability.
- **Final Round Defection:** Maximizes immediate payoff without concern for future repercussions.

This strategy balances exploitation and cooperation, adapting dynamically to the game's state and opponents' behaviors, aiming to optimize long-term payoffs while being robust against various strategies.

To address the problem, we need a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the common resource. The strategy should encourage cooperation when overexploitation is evident and allow defection when it's safe to do so without jeopardizing future benefits.

### Approach
The proposed strategy involves several key components:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to observe others' behavior and minimize initial impact.
2. **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, always Defect since there are no future consequences beyond that round.
3. **Stock Level Threshold**: If the current stock level falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), Defect to maximize immediate gain.
4. **Historical Consumption Check**: For other rounds, calculate the total consumption from the previous round based on observed actions (number of Cooperate and Defect moves). Compare this against half of the previous stock level to determine if overexploitation occurred:
   - If past total consumption exceeds half the previous stock, Cooperate to help sustain the resource.
   - Otherwise, Defect to exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate payoff.

This approach ensures that we balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adjusting behavior based on historical actions and current stock levels.

### Solution Code
```python
def strategy(actions_history, current_stock, capacity, round_number, total_rounds):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "COOPERATE"
    
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        return "DEFECT"
    
    threshold = 0.2 * capacity
    
    # Check if current stock is below the threshold
    if current_stock < threshold:
        return "DEFECT"
    
    # Calculate previous round's total consumption
    prev_actions = actions_history[round_number - 2]
    k_cooperate = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == "COOPERATE")
    n = len(prev_actions)
    prev_stock = actions_history_stock[round_number - 2]  # Assuming we have access to previous stock
    
    total_consumption = (k_cooperate * (prev_stock / (2 * n))) + ((n - k_cooperate) * (prev_stock / n))
    
    if total_consumption > prev_stock / 2:
        return "COOPERATE"
    else:
        return "DEFECT"

# Note: This assumes that actions_history and actions_history_stock are maintained,
# where actions_history[i] contains the list of actions in round i+1,
# and actions_history_stock[i] is the stock level at the start of round i+1.
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, we set a conservative tone and allow ourselves to gather information on others' strategies.
- **Final Round Defection**: In the last round, there's no future impact, so defecting maximizes immediate gain without repercussions.
- **Stock Threshold Check**: If resources are critically low, defecting ensures we capture as much value as possible before potential depletion.
- **Historical Consumption Analysis**: By examining past actions, we determine if overexploitation has occurred. Cooperating when others have been greedy helps sustain the resource for future rounds, while defecting when others cooperate allows us to exploit their conservatism.

This strategy dynamically adapts based on observed behavior and current conditions, aiming to optimize cumulative payoffs across all rounds.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start with Cooperation (C) in the first round to encourage a cooperative environment.

2. **Stock Level Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the current stock level relative to capacity. If the stock falls below 25% of capacity, switch to Cooperation to help replenish it.

3. **Opponent Behavior Analysis**: Track opponents' past actions using a moving average of their recent moves (e.g., last 3 rounds). Calculate the average cooperation rate among them.

4. **Adaptive Decision Making**:
   - If the majority of opponents are Cooperating, defect to exploit their cooperation for higher payoffs.
   - If opponents are mostly Defecting, consider balancing between exploiting and maintaining stock sustainability by cooperating more frequently.
   
5. **Trend Assessment**: Use a moving average of recent stock levels to determine if there's a negative or positive trend. A negative trend indicates the need for more Cooperation.

6. **Last Round Strategy**: In the final round, always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

7. **Proportional Response**: Adjust defecting frequency proportionally based on opponents' defection rates to balance exploitation and resource maintenance.

This strategy adaptively balances exploiting opponents' behaviors with maintaining a sustainable stock level, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.

To address the challenge of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game with a common pool resource, I have considered various strategies that balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Threshold-Based Defection

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a baseline and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Monitor the stock level relative to capacity.
     - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, defect to maximize immediate gains while allowing growth to sustain future rounds.
     - If the stock is between 50% and 75%, cooperate to support recovery or maintenance.
     - If the stock drops below 50%, defect to capture remaining value, as future payoffs may be minimal.
3. **Last Round**: Always defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

This strategy adapts based on observable state (stock level) and balances exploitation with conservation, aiming to sustain resource availability while seizing advantageous opportunities.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_414 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to encourage initial cooperation and observe others' behaviors.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - Calculate the average number of defectors from previous rounds. If this average exceeds 50%, switch strategy to Defect (D). Otherwise, continue with Cooperate (C).
     - Monitor the stock level. If it falls below 50% of capacity, shift towards cooperation to facilitate replenishment.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Start with Cooperation to set a cooperative tone.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - Use historical data on opponents' actions to inform current decisions, encouraging defection when others are defecting and cooperation when others cooperate.
   - Adapt strategy based on stock levels to balance exploitation with sustainability, ensuring long-term payoffs.

4. **Adaptation Mechanism:**
   - Employ a moving average or weighted average of past defections to determine the threshold for switching strategies.
   - Adjust cooperation or defection based on current stock conditions to maintain resource viability.

This strategy balances immediate gain with sustainable resource management, adapting to both opponent behavior and environmental factors to maximize overall payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_415 = '''
To maximize personal gain while considering the dynamics of cooperation and defection among players, the optimal strategy is as follows:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This initiates with a high stock level for future exploitation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players in previous rounds.
     - Let `total_coop_others` be the total number of times other players chose C.
     - Compute `avg_coop_others = total_coop_others / ((current_round - 1) * (n - 1))`.
   - If `avg_coop_others > 0.5`, choose Defect (D). This exploits others' cooperation for higher payoffs.
   - Otherwise, choose Cooperate (C) to maintain or increase the stock level.

3. **Last Round (r):** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate gain since there's no future stock to preserve.

This strategy balances exploiting cooperative behavior in others while maintaining stock levels when necessary, ensuring optimal personal payoffs throughout the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_416 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Strategy:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to observe the impact of others' actions on the stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Strategy:**
   - **Stock Level Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the current stock level and its trend over previous rounds.
   - **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** 
     - Calculate a threshold based on the remaining rounds and historical data. The threshold starts high (e.g., 75% of capacity) and decreases as the game progresses.
     - If the stock level falls below this threshold, switch to Defect (D). Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).
   - **Opponent Behavior Analysis:** Assess the average consumption pattern of opponents. If a significant number defected in previous rounds, consider defecting to maximize immediate payoffs.

3. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - **Final Round:** Always choose Defect (D) if the stock level is sufficient to provide a payoff. If the stock is too low, Cooperate (C) to ensure some payoff.

4. **Adaptive Elements:**
   - **Conservation vs. Exploitation Balance:** Early rounds focus on conservation by cooperating, while later rounds may shift towards exploitation by defecting if the stock is stable or opponents are defecting.
   - **Player Number Consideration:** Adjust strategy based on the number of players; with more players, defect slightly more as individual impact is lessened.

5. **Robustness and Adaptability:**
   - The strategy adapts to various opponent behaviors without relying on cooperation, ensuring resilience against different play styles.

This approach balances exploitation and conservation, adjusting dynamically based on game state and opponents' actions, aiming to maximize overall payoffs while preserving stock for future rounds when beneficial.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_417 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we have developed a comprehensive approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy is adaptive, robust, and considers both game state and history to maximize total payoff.

### Strategy Overview:

The strategy is designed to be cooperative initially but switches to defection when certain conditions are met, such as significant stock depletion or approaching the endgame. This approach ensures that the player can exploit others' cooperation while minimizing the risk of stock depletion.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C).
     - Rationale: Starting with cooperation helps maintain a high initial stock level and encourages potential cooperation from other players, maximizing future payoffs.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - Monitor the average stock level over the past three rounds.
     - If this average falls below 50% of the capacity, switch to Defection (D).
     - Additionally, if fewer than two rounds remain, defect in those last rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to establish a high initial stock level.
- **Last Two Rounds:** Switch to Defection to maximize immediate payoffs since there are limited future consequences.

### Strategy Details:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, the player cooperates to set a foundation for a sustainable stock level.

2. **Stock Trend Monitoring:**
   - After each round, calculate the average stock level over the past three rounds.
   - If this average drops below 50% of the capacity, indicating potential overexploitation by other players, the strategy shifts to Defection.

3. **Endgame Switch:**
   - In the last two rounds, regardless of stock levels, the player defects to maximize short-term gains since there are no future rounds to consider after that.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, round_number, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        # Calculate average stock over past three rounds
        avg_stock = sum(history['stock'][-3:]) / len(history['stock'][-3:])
        if avg_stock < (capacity / 2) or (r - round_number) <= 2:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, the player contributes to a high initial stock level, which is beneficial for all players and encourages others to cooperate.
- **Stock Monitoring:** The strategy continuously assesses the health of the stock. A significant drop in average stock levels signals potential overexploitation by other players, prompting a shift towards defection to protect against further losses.
- **Endgame Strategy:** In the final rounds, the player defects to secure immediate gains without concern for future consequences, optimizing short-term benefits.

This strategy effectively balances cooperation and defection, ensuring that the player can exploit opportunities while safeguarding against significant stock depletion.

To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, I propose the following structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy balances cooperation and defection by adapting to the stock level, opponents' actions, and the stage of the game. It aims to maximize immediate gains while preserving the resource for future rounds.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Builds trust and maintains a high stock level early on, encouraging others to cooperate.

2. **Monitor Opponents' Actions:**
   - After the initial phase, assess the number of defectors in the previous round.
     - **If >50% defected:** Switch to defecting in the next round.
     - **Else:** Continue cooperating.

3. **Stock Conservation Threshold:**
   - If stock falls below 30-40% of capacity:
     - **Action:** Cooperate to allow regrowth, ensuring future payoffs.

4. **Endgame Strategy (Last Round and Few Rounds Before):**
   - **Final Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate gain.
   - **Pre-Final Rounds:** If stock is high, consider defecting to increase current payoff without significant risk to future rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation.
- **Last Round:** Prioritize defection for maximum immediate gain.
- **Low Stock:** Shift focus to conservation by cooperating if stock drops below the threshold.

### Adaptation and Robustness:
The strategy adjusts based on opponents' behavior and stock levels, ensuring it remains exploitative without relying on others' cooperation. It balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

This approach is designed to be flexible, reacting dynamically to game conditions while maintaining a focus on maximizing personal payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_419 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to maximize initial payoff and maintain high stock levels.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - **Cooperation Threshold:** If ≥75% of players cooperated in the previous round, Defect (D) to exploit their cooperation for higher payoffs.
     - **Defection Response:** If <50% cooperated, Cooperate (C) to support stock regrowth and prevent depletion.
     - **Intermediate Cooperation (50-74%):** Use a mixed strategy with 60% chance to Cooperate and 40% Defect, adjusting based on recent trends.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future stock isn't a concern.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** If stock drops below 20% of capacity, switch to Cooperation (C) to allow regrowth and prevent depletion.

3. **Adaptive Elements:**
   - Monitor recent cooperation rates over the last few rounds to detect trends. Adjust strategy accordingly:
     - Increasing Cooperation: Gradually increase Defection.
     - Decreasing Cooperation: Increase Cooperation to stabilize the stock.
   - Introduce randomness (e.g., ±10%) in decision probabilities to avoid predictability and deter exploitation by others.

4. **Exploitative Mindset:**
   - The strategy aims to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability, exploiting others' cooperation while safeguarding against stock depletion.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
function decide_action(history, state):
    if first_round:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        previous_cooperation = calculate_cooperation_rate(history)
        if rounds_remaining == 1:
            return Defect
        if state.stock < 0.2 * capacity:
            return Cooperate
        if previous_cooperation >= 0.75:
            return Defect with high probability
        elif previous_cooperation < 0.5:
            return Cooperate
        else:
            trend = analyze_recent_trend(history)
            mix = adjust_mix_based_on_trend(trend)
            return random_choice(mix)
```

This strategy dynamically adapts to others' behavior, balancing exploitation with sustainability, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_420 = '''
The strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource game balances cooperation and defection to maximize long-term payoffs while adapting to opponents' behaviors. Here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1-2):**
   - Cooperate to establish trust and observe others' actions.
   - Monitor how many players cooperate or defect.

2. **Assessment Phase:**
   - If ≥80% of players cooperated in the last round, continue cooperating.
   - If <80% cooperated, switch to defecting to protect your payoff.

3. **Punishment and Recovery Phase:**
   - If stock drops below 25% of capacity, cooperate for the next few rounds to allow recovery.
   - After recovery (stock >50%), gradually return to assessing cooperation levels.

4. **Final Rounds (Last 1-2 Rounds):**
   - Defect to maximize immediate payoff as future consequences are irrelevant.

### Considerations and Adjustments:
- **Thresholds:** The 80% cooperation and 25% stock thresholds can be adjusted based on game parameters like n and capacity for optimal performance.
- **Forgiveness Mechanism:** After a punishment phase, if others start cooperating again, consider switching back to cooperation.
- **Transition Smoothness:** Ensure clear metrics for transitioning between phases to avoid strategy oscillation.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    stock = get_current_stock()

    if current_round <= 2:
        return "C"  # Initial cooperation

    prev_actions = history[-1]["actions"]
    num_coop = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == "C")
    coop_percent = num_coop / n

    if coop_percent >= 0.8 and stock > capacity * 0.25:
        return "C"
    elif stock <= capacity * 0.25:
        # Punishment phase: cooperate to recover
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"  # Defect due to insufficient cooperation

    if current_round >= r - 1:
        return "D"  # Final rounds: defect
```

### Conclusion:
This adaptive strategy aims to sustain the stock for long-term benefits while being robust against exploitation. It adjusts based on collective behavior and stock levels, ensuring a balance between cooperation and self-interest.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_421 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (Round 1):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a sustainable stock level and observe others' behaviors.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If the average cooperation rate of all players in the previous round is above 50%, continue cooperating.
   - **Defection Trigger:** If the cooperation rate drops below 50%, switch to defecting to maximize personal gain, as others are likely exploiting the resource heavily.

3. **Last Few Rounds (Rounds r-1 and r):**
   - **Stock Check:** Assess the current stock level.
     - If the stock is at or near capacity, defect to secure a higher immediate payoff without worrying about future depletion.
     - If the stock is low, consider cooperating if others are doing so to allow some recovery.

4. **Adaptive Response:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock's health and other players' actions. Adjust strategy dynamically:
     - If recent rounds show significant depletion due to others defecting, increase defection.
     - If cooperation leads to stock recovery, maintain or increase cooperative actions.

5. **Prevent Exploitation:**
   - Implement a rule to avoid being exploited by consistent defectors. If identified, mirror their strategy to prevent undue advantage.

This strategy balances early conservation with strategic exploitation towards the end, adapting based on both stock dynamics and opponents' behaviors, ensuring robustness against various approaches.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_422 = '''
To address the challenge of designing a robust and exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can employ an adaptive approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Threshold Exploitation (ATE)

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C) to initiate the game without immediately depleting the stock and observe others' behaviors.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Level Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the current stock level relative to the capacity after each round.
   - **Threshold-Based Decision Making**:
     - If the stock is above 75% of capacity: Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as the stock is sufficiently high to sustain growth despite increased consumption.
     - If the stock is between 50% and 75%: Cooperate (C) to maintain a balance between current payoffs and future sustainability.
     - If the stock falls below 50%: Switch to Defect (D) to exploit remaining resources, as conservation becomes critical but immediate gains are prioritized.

3. **Final Round Handling**:
   - In the last round, defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future depletion.

### Strategy Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation allows for an assessment of other players' strategies while preserving the stock.
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: By adjusting actions based on stock levels, the strategy ensures that exploitation is balanced with conservation, preventing rapid depletion and maintaining resource availability for future rounds.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Recognizing that there's no future beyond the last round, defecting maximizes immediate gains.

### Edge Cases Consideration

- **Low Stock Levels**: When the stock is critically low (below 50%), the strategy shifts to defecting to secure remaining resources, acknowledging that conservation may no longer be viable.
- **High Stock Levels**: At higher stock levels (above 75%), defecting is safe as growth can replenish the resource sufficiently.

### Implementation Notes

The strategy can be implemented using simple conditional checks based on current stock levels relative to capacity. This approach ensures adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors, aligning with an exploitative mindset focused on maximizing individual payoffs while considering resource sustainability.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C). This initial move aims to set a cooperative tone and preserve the stock for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: Monitor the current stock level. If it drops below 50% of capacity, switch to Defect (D) in the next round to secure remaining resources before depletion.
   - **Opponent Behavior Assessment**: Evaluate the actions of other players in the previous round. If a majority defected, choose to Defect in the next round to protect against further stock decline.
   - **Sustainability Check**: If the stock is above the threshold and most players cooperated recently, continue Cooperating to maintain a healthy stock level.

3. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final few rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds), always Defect to maximize immediate payoffs, as future sustainability becomes less relevant.

**Decision Rules Summary**:
- Start with cooperation to encourage stock preservation.
- Adapt based on stock levels and opponents' recent actions.
- Switch to defecting if the stock is critically low or if others are frequently defecting.

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_426 = '''
To address the problem of optimizing individual payoffs in a common-pool resource game while balancing sustainability and exploitation, we propose a strategic approach that combines cooperation with exploitation, particularly in the endgame.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by Cooperating in the first round to establish a baseline of behavior and observe others' actions.

2. **Reactive Adjustment**:
   - For each subsequent round (until the last 10% of rounds), check the total consumption from the previous round.
     - If the total consumption exceeds half of the capacity (`capacity / 2`), Cooperate in the current round to help sustain the resource.
     - Otherwise, Defect to maximize personal gains.

3. **Endgame Exploitation**: In the last 10% of rounds (e.g., if there are 10 rounds, this applies to rounds 6-10), switch to always Defecting. This maximizes short-term gains without concern for future sustainability since the game is nearing its end.

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of others' behavior.
  
- **Reactive Adjustment**: By Cooperating when previous consumption was high, we help sustain the resource for future rounds. Defecting when consumption was manageable allows personal gain without jeopardizing sustainability.
  
- **Endgame Exploitation**: Recognizes that in the final stages, maximizing immediate payoffs is optimal since there are no future rounds to preserve the resource for.

This strategy balances between preserving the common resource and exploiting it for individual benefit, adapting based on collective behavior observed in previous rounds.

To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in a dynamic environment where the stock level changes based on collective actions, we can use an adaptive strategy that responds to observed trends. The key is to balance cooperation with the temptation to defect when others may be over-harvesting. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round. This sets a baseline of behavior and allows observation of subsequent stock levels.

2. **Monitor Stock Trends**:
   - After each round, calculate the change in stock level (ΔS) from the previous round.
   - Track whether the stock has decreased for two consecutive rounds.

3. **Switch to Defecting**: If the stock decreases for two consecutive rounds, switch strategy to defecting. This indicates potential over-harvesting by others, necessitating a shift to protect one's own payoff.

4. **Hysteresis Mechanism**:
   - Once in the defecting state, continue defecting until the stock increases for two consecutive rounds.
   - When such an increase is observed, revert to cooperating. This prevents rapid switching and ensures stability.

This strategy allows adaptation to collective behavior while maintaining robustness against short-term fluctuations, ensuring a balance between cooperation and self-interest.

**Final Answer**: Use a trend-following strategy with hysteresis—cooperate initially, defect if the stock decreases for two consecutive rounds, then revert to cooperating after two consecutive increases. This approach is encapsulated in the following steps:

1. **Start Cooperating**: Cooperate in the first round.
2. **Track Trends**: Monitor the stock level after each round.
3. **Switch Strategies Based on Trends**:
   - If the stock decreases for two rounds in a row, switch to defecting.
   - After defecting, revert to cooperating once the stock increases for two consecutive rounds.

This adaptive method ensures responsiveness while mitigating the impact of random fluctuations. 

**Answer**: \boxed{\text{Adapt strategy based on observed trends with hysteresis}}

description_EXPLOITATIVE_428 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate or Defect in each round of the game while maintaining a balance between maximizing immediate payoffs and preserving future stock levels, we can outline a strategy that incorporates reactive elements and edge case handling. Here's how the strategy is structured:

### Strategy Outline

1. **Last Round Handling**: In the final round (t = r), always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

2. **Stock Recovery Mechanism**: If the current stock level drops below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), Cooperate to reduce consumption and allow the stock to recover.

3. **Initial Cooperation**: In the first round, Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and maintain a healthy starting stock level.

4. **Reactive Strategy for Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the total consumption from the previous round.
   - If the total consumption exceeds half the capacity (implying significant defection), Defect in the current round as a retaliatory measure.
   - Otherwise, continue Cooperating to sustain the stock.

### Solution Code

```python
def strategy(current_stock, prev_stock, C, t, r):
    if t == r:
        return "Defect"
    
    D = 0.25 * C
    
    if current_stock < D:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    if t == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Calculate total_consumption from last round
    # We need to solve for total_consumption given S_prev and S_current
    # Since it's complex, we approximate by checking if the stock increased or decreased significantly
    
    # Approximation: if current_stock < prev_stock, assume overconsumption
    if current_stock < prev_stock:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        return "Cooperate"

# Example usage:
C = 100  # Capacity
r = 10   # Total rounds

for t in range(1, r + 1):
    if t == 1:
        action = "Cooperate"
        prev_stock = C - (C / (2 * 1)) * 1  # Simplified example of consumption
    else:
        current_stock = prev_stock
        action = strategy(current_stock, prev_stock, C, t, r)
        if action == "Defect":
            # Example consumption when defecting
            prev_stock = max(prev_stock - (C / 1), 0)  # Simplified example
        else:
            # Example consumption when cooperating
            prev_stock = current_stock - (C / (2 * 1)) 
    print(f"Round {t}: {action}")
```

### Explanation

- **Last Round Handling**: The strategy ensures maximum payoff in the final round by always Defecting, as there are no future rounds to consider.
  
- **Stock Recovery**: By Cooperating when stock is low, the strategy prevents depletion and allows recovery, ensuring sustainable play.

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a positive tone and helps maintain high initial stock levels.

- **Reactive Mechanism**: The strategy reacts to previous round's consumption. If overconsumption is detected (through stock decrease), it defects to deter exploitation by others.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically based on the game's state and opponents' actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_429 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an effective and adaptive strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose the following structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Triggered Defection

1. **Initial Round Cooperation**:
   - In the first round, always cooperate (choose action C). This initial cooperation sets a baseline to observe others' behavior and gauge their propensity to defect.

2. **Post-Round Assessment**:
   - After each subsequent round, calculate the expected stock level if all players had cooperated in that round.
     - Calculate total consumption under full cooperation: \( C_{\text{total}} = \frac{S_t}{2} \)
     - Determine the remaining stock: \( S_{\text{remaining}} = S_t - C_{\text{total}} \)
     - Compute the expected growth and new stock level:
       \[
           \text{Growth} = 2 \times S_{\text{remaining}} \times \left(1 - \frac{S_{\text{remaining}}}{\text{capacity}}\right)
           \]
       \[
           \text{ExpectedNewS} = \min(S_{\text{remaining}} + \text{Growth}, \text{capacity})
       \]
   - Compare the actual stock level \( S_{t+1} \) with the expected stock level under full cooperation.

3. **Defection Trigger**:
   - If the actual stock level \( S_{t+1} \) is less than the expected stock level, it indicates that other players defected. Upon this trigger, switch strategy to defecting (choose action D) for all subsequent rounds until the end of the game.

4. **Last Round Defection**:
   - Regardless of prior actions, in the final round (round \( r \)), always choose to defect. This ensures maximizing immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to preserve resources for.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation allows for the maximum possible resource regeneration if others also cooperate.
- **Observation and Trigger Mechanism**: By comparing actual stock levels against expected levels under full cooperation, the strategy can detect when defection by others begins. This triggers a switch to defecting to avoid being exploited.
- **Final Round Maximization**: Defecting in the last round ensures that you capture as much of the remaining resource as possible, knowing there are no future consequences.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, adapting based on observed behavior to optimize payoff while minimizing exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_430 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed a comprehensive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize payoffs. The strategy is adaptive, considering both the current state of the stock and the history of players' actions, while also focusing on exploiting opportunities in the endgame.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate in the first round to encourage a high initial stock level and observe other players' behavior.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making (Subsequent Rounds):**
   - **Stock Thresholds:** Use 75% and 50% of capacity as thresholds.
     - If the stock is above 75% and at least half of the players cooperated previously, continue cooperating to maintain a healthy stock.
     - If the stock drops below 50%, switch to cooperation to help replenish it for future rounds.
   - **Defection:** When the stock is between 50-75% of capacity or fewer than half of the players cooperated last round, defect to maximize immediate gains without severely depleting the stock.

3. **Endgame Exploitation (Last 25% of Rounds):**
   - Shift strategy to always defect in the final quarter of the game to secure higher payoffs when future rounds are less critical.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round, stock, capacity, prev_actions):
    n = number_of_players()
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate thresholds and cooperation rate
    stock_threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
    stock_threshold_low = 0.5 * capacity
    prev_coop_rate = sum(prev_actions) / n
    
    # Check endgame condition
    if round > 0.75 * total_rounds:
        return "D"
    
    # Determine action based on thresholds and cooperation rate
    if (stock > stock_threshold_high) and (prev_coop_rate >= 0.5):
        return "C"
    elif stock < stock_threshold_low:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

# Example usage in a game context:
action = decide_action(current_round, current_stock, capacity, previous_actions)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, we set a positive tone and allow the stock to remain high, which is beneficial for all players.
  
- **Adaptive Strategy:** The strategy dynamically adjusts based on the stock level. It rewards past cooperation when the stock is healthy but switches to defection if others exploit or if the stock needs preservation.

- **Endgame Focus:** Recognizing that late-game rounds offer less incentive to preserve stock, the strategy shifts to maximize immediate payoffs, ensuring higher returns without concern for future depletion.

This approach ensures robustness against various opponent behaviors while maintaining adaptability and a focus on maximizing individual payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_431 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on observed trends in the stock level. The approach is adaptive, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors while maximizing payoffs.

### Strategy Overview: "Adaptive Trend Response"

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by Cooperating (C) in the first round to avoid immediate depletion and encourage others to do the same.
2. **Monitor Stock Trends**: After the initial rounds, observe whether the stock level is increasing, stable, or decreasing over a few consecutive rounds.
3. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - If the stock trend indicates that it's increasing or stable, continue Cooperating (C) to maintain sustainable resource use.
   - If the stock trend shows a significant decline (e.g., dropping below 80% of capacity), switch to Defecting (D) to protect your payoffs from others' potential defection.
4. **Final Round Greed**: In the last round, always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

### Edge Cases and Considerations

- **First Round**: Cooperate to set a positive tone and avoid early depletion.
- **Last Round**: Defect to maximize short-term gain since there are no subsequent rounds.
- **Stock Thresholds**: Use specific thresholds (e.g., 80% of capacity) to determine when to switch strategies based on stock trends.

### Rationale

This strategy is designed to be responsive without being overly reactive. By starting with cooperation, it sets a collaborative tone and preserves the resource for future rounds. Monitoring stock trends allows the player to adapt as others' behaviors change, balancing between maintaining cooperation when beneficial and defecting to avoid exploitation. The final round defection ensures maximum immediate gain, considering there are no future consequences.

This approach is robust across different numbers of players and capacities, making it suitable for a wide range of scenarios in the tournament setting.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_432 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Action:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of other players' initial moves.

2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Level Monitoring:** 
     - If the stock falls below a dynamic threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), switch to Defect (D) to secure resources before potential depletion.
   - **Opponent Behavior Analysis:**
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate of all players in previous rounds. If this rate is above a specified threshold (e.g., 50%), continue Cooperating; otherwise, Defect.
   - **Adaptive Thresholds:** Adjust thresholds based on game parameters such as number of players and stock growth rates to ensure robustness.

3. **Final Round Action:**
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future consequences beyond this round.

4. **Considerations:**
   - **Stock Growth Rates:** If the stock regrows quickly, maintain a more cooperative stance; if slow, be cautious to avoid overconsumption.
   - **Remaining Rounds:** Adjust strategy based on remaining rounds, favoring sustainability when many rounds are left and short-term gains as the game concludes.

This strategy balances cooperation and defection by dynamically responding to both environmental factors (stock levels) and social dynamics (opponent actions), ensuring adaptability and robustness against diverse behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_433 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round, we can develop a strategy based on the current state of the stock and the remaining number of rounds. This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to gauge the system's behavior and maintain a healthy stock level for future exploitation.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Threshold Check:** If the current stock \( S \) is above 50% of the capacity, defect (D). Otherwise, cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale:** When the stock is plentiful, exploit it by defecting to gain higher payoffs. When it's low, conserve it by cooperating.

3. **Endgame Rounds:**
   - **Action:** Always Defect (D)
   - **Threshold:** Last 20% of total rounds.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate gains in the final stages since future sustainability is no longer a concern.

### Implementation:

- **Step 1:** Observe the current stock level \( S \).
- **Step 2:** Determine the number of remaining rounds \( r \).
- **Step 3:**
  - If \( r \) is in the last 20% of total rounds, choose D.
  - Else, if \( S > 0.5 \times \text{capacity} \), choose D.
  - Otherwise, choose C.

### Example:

In a game with 10 rounds and capacity = 100 units:
- Rounds 1-8: Check stock level each round. Defect if above 50; else cooperate.
- Rounds 9-10: Always defect to maximize payoffs.

This strategy allows you to exploit high stock levels while preserving them when necessary, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and future sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_434 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that maximizes individual payoffs while considering the sustainability of the resource. The strategy should adapt based on opponents' actions and the current state of the stock.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Conservation (AEC)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and observe others' initial moves.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - Calculate the average number of defectors in the previous round.
  - If more than half of the players defected, defect in the current round.
  - If fewer than half defected, cooperate if the stock is above 75% of capacity; otherwise, defect to prevent depletion.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future impact.

#### 2. Edge Cases Handling:
- **Low Stock (<25% of Capacity):** Cooperate to allow growth for future rounds unless it's the last round.
- **High Stock (>75% of Capacity):** Consider defecting if others are exploiting, but cooperate if sustainable use is observed.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, current_stock, history, current_round, total_rounds):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        prev_actions = history[-1]
        defectors = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
        avg_defect = defectors / n
        
        if avg_defect > 0.5:
            if current_stock < 0.25 * capacity and current_round != total_rounds:
                return "C"
            else:
                return "D"
        else:
            if current_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
                return "D" if (current_stock / capacity) < 0.9 else "C"
            else:
                return "C"
    if current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"

```

### Explanation:

- **First Round Cooperation:** Encourages initial cooperation to maximize collective payoffs.
- **Adaptive Decision Making:** Monitors opponents' actions and adjusts behavior to exploit or conserve based on their strategies and stock levels.
- **Conservation Thresholds:** Uses stock levels to determine when to cooperate to ensure future resources, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

This strategy aims to exploit opportunities while maintaining resource health, ensuring robust performance against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_435 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to cooperate (C) or defect (D) in a repeated game with an unknown number of players, we can adopt an adaptive strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the resource (stock). The key considerations are observing others' behavior, maintaining stock levels for future payoffs, and maximizing the final round's payoff. Here’s the step-by-step approach:

1. **First Round: Cooperate**
   - Start by cooperating to observe the initial conditions and others' actions without immediately exploiting.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Assess Others’ Behavior:** Calculate the proportion of defections among other players in previous rounds.
     - If more than 50% of other players defected, choose to defect this round.
   - **Stock Level Consideration:**
     - If the current stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), cooperate to allow regeneration for future payoffs.

3. **Last Round (Round r): Always Defect**
   - In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

**Summary:**

- **First Round:** Cooperate.
- **Middle Rounds:** Adapt based on others' past actions and current stock level; defect if others defected more or cooperate to maintain stock.
- **Last Round:** Defect to maximize immediate gain.

This strategy ensures you adapt to others’ tendencies while preserving the resource for future gains, except in the final round where immediate payoff is prioritized.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_436 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Reciprocal Conservation (ARC)**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to set a cooperative tone, encouraging others to follow suit.

2. **Reciprocal Action**:
   - Calculate the average number of defections from other players in the previous round.
   - If the majority defected, defect in the current round to avoid being exploited.
   - If most cooperated, continue cooperating to sustain the stock for future benefits.

3. **Stock Level Consideration**:
   - Monitor the current stock level and its trend (increasing or decreasing).
   - If the stock is low, prioritize cooperation to allow replenishment, even if others defect.
   - When the stock is high and stable, consider defecting cautiously to maximize immediate gains without jeopardizing future rounds.

4. **Last Round Strategy**:
   - In the final round, defect to maximize immediate payoff since there are no subsequent rounds dependent on the current stock level.

5. **Stock Trend Adaptation**: Adjust your strategy based on whether the stock is increasing or decreasing post-consumption and growth phases. If the stock is depleting rapidly, switch to cooperation to conserve resources for future use.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting to others' behaviors and the game's state, ensuring robustness across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_437 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose the following approach:

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy combines initial cooperation with adaptive responses based on observed game outcomes. It monitors the health of the common pool and adjusts behavior to balance exploitation with sustainability.

### Decision Rules:

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, Cooperate (C) to encourage others to do the same and establish a baseline for future comparisons.

2. **Monitor and Adapt:**
   - After each round, calculate the average payoff per player.
   - Track the moving average of payoffs over the last few rounds.
   - If the recent average payoff drops significantly (e.g., by 10-20%) compared to previous averages, indicating potential overexploitation, switch to Defect (D) in subsequent rounds.

3. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Once you start defecting, continue monitoring the stock levels and payoffs.
   - If the stock begins to recover or if others' cooperation increases (indicated by rising payoffs), revert to Cooperate to maintain a healthy resource pool.

4. **Final Round Strategy:**
   - In the last round, switch to Defect (D) to maximize immediate gain since future interactions won't occur, and thus there's no risk of retaliation in subsequent rounds.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect.
- **Sudden Changes:** If a significant drop in stock or payoffs is detected, defect to signal dissatisfaction and encourage others to cooperate.
- **Recovery Detection:** If after defecting, the stock shows signs of recovery and average payoffs increase, resume cooperation.

### Pseudocode Example:

```python
def strategy(game_state):
    if game_state['round'] == 1:
        return 'C'
    elif game_state['round'] == game_state['total_rounds']:
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Calculate moving average of payoffs over the last few rounds (e.g., window_size = 3)
        current_payoff = calculate_current_payoff()
        moving_average = compute_moving_average(window_size=3)
        if current_payoff < moving_average * 0.8:  # Adjust threshold as needed
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

# Helper functions to compute payoff and moving average
def calculate_current_payoff():
    # Implement logic to get the current round's payoff
    pass

def compute_moving_average(window_size):
    # Implement logic to compute moving average of payoffs over window_size rounds
    pass
```

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages others to cooperate initially, potentially leading to higher collective payoffs.
- **Adaptive Response:** By monitoring and responding to changes in payoff averages, the strategy can dynamically adjust to prevent overexploitation while still exploiting opportunities when others are cooperative.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** Defecting when others overexploit helps maintain resource sustainability and deters excessive defection.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** Maximizes immediate gain without concern for future repercussions.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic exploitation, aiming to optimize long-term payoffs while being robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_438 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a comprehensive approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. The strategy adapts based on both the current state of the stock and the historical actions of other players.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round**:
   - **Action**: Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale**: Start by cooperating to observe others' initial moves without causing immediate depletion, allowing time to gather information on opponents' tendencies.

2. **Subsequent Rounds** (Rounds 2 to r-1):
   - **Assessment**:
     - Calculate the average number of defections (D) by other players in previous rounds.
     - Evaluate the current stock level and its trend (increasing, decreasing, stable).
   
   - **Decision Rules**:
     - **Stock Threshold**: If the stock falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to cooperating (C) to help replenish it.
     - **Defection Rate**: If more than half of the other players defected in previous rounds, defect (D) to exploit their greed and maximize immediate payoff.
     - **Stock Trend**: If the stock has been decreasing for several consecutive rounds, cooperate (C) to prevent further depletion.

3. **Last Round** (Round r):
   - **Action**: Defect (D)
   - **Rationale**: Since there are no future rounds, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff by taking a larger share from the remaining stock.

### Detailed Decision-Making Process:

- **First Round**: Cooperate to observe and gather initial data on others' behavior.
  
- **Middle Rounds**:
  - Monitor the average defection rate of other players. If it exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 50%), defect to align with their strategy and capture higher payoffs before potential depletion.
  - Track the stock level and its trend. Cooperate if the stock is below the threshold or has been declining, aiming to conserve for future rounds.

- **Final Round**: Defect without hesitation to secure the maximum possible payoff from the remaining stock.

### Implementation Considerations:

- **Parameters**:
  - **Stock Threshold**: Set at 50% of capacity as a trigger point.
  - **Defection Threshold**: Adjust based on historical data, but start with 50%.
  
- **Adaptation Mechanism**:
  - Continuously update the assessment of other players' strategies and adjust actions accordingly.

This strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors by balancing exploitation and conservation, ensuring adaptability across different game scenarios.

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to observe opponents' initial moves without immediately depleting the stock.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - Calculate the average number of defectors in previous rounds.
  - Monitor the trend of the stock level over time:
    - If the stock has been decreasing consistently, switch to Defect (D).
    - If many opponents have defected historically, choose D to capitalize on their exploitation before stock depletion accelerates.
  - If the current stock is below a threshold (e.g., capacity / 2), defect more frequently to secure resources before they dwindle further.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to gauge opponents' strategies and maintain initial stock levels.
- **Last Round:** Defect if the remaining stock is low, prioritizing immediate gain since there are no future rounds to consider.
- Adjust behavior dynamically based on observed opponent actions and stock trends.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
The strategy balances between sustaining the resource for future gains and exploiting opponents' cooperation. It reacts to historical actions by defecting when others have frequently defected, thus maximizing personal payoffs while considering the need to maintain stock levels for sustained play.

This approach ensures adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors, leveraging both cooperative starts and strategic defection based on observed patterns and resource state.
'''

To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we can outline a structured approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and current state. Here’s a refined strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Reciprocal Exploitation (ARES)

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Encourage high initial stock levels to maximize future payoffs by setting a cooperative tone.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Assessment:** Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players in the previous round.
     - Cooperation Rate = Number of Cooperators / Total Players.
   - **Decision Rules:**
     - If the average cooperation rate is above 0.5, cooperate.
     - If below or equal to 0.5, defect.
     - Introduce a forgiveness mechanism by cooperating again if the cooperation rate increases in subsequent rounds.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Defect.
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff as there are no future consequences.

4. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - Monitor the current stock level after each round.
   - If the stock falls below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), increase cooperation to aid recovery, regardless of others' actions.

                coop_trend = calculate_cooperation_trend(history)
                if coop_trend > 0 and random.random() < 0.2:  # 20% chance to forgive
                    return "C"
                else:
                    return "D"

def calculate_cooperation_trend(history):
    # Returns the trend in cooperation rate over last few rounds (e.g., slope)
    pass
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to establish a high stock level.
- **Adaptive Response:** Uses the previous round's cooperation rate to decide actions, promoting reciprocity.
- **Forgiveness Mechanism:** Allows for occasional cooperation even after defection, encouraging mutual cooperation.
- **Stock Preservation:** Prioritizes stock recovery when levels are critically low.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Defects in the final round to maximize immediate gain.

This strategy balances exploitation with maintaining resource sustainability, adapting dynamically to opponents' behaviors and the game's state.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Decision Rules:**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - Rationale: Establish a baseline of cooperation to observe others' reactions and set a foundation for potential mutual cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r):**
   - **Monitor Previous Actions:**
     - Track the number of players who defected in the previous round.
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate as the proportion of players who cooperated.

   - **Adaptive Strategy Based on Cooperation Rate:**
     - If the average cooperation rate from the previous round is above 50%, continue to Cooperate (C).
       - This encourages sustained resource levels when there's a tendency towards cooperation.
     - If the average cooperation rate drops to 50% or below, switch to Defecting (D) for the current round.
       - This exploits others' cooperation and incentivizes them to maintain higher cooperation levels.

   - **Stock Level Monitoring:**
     - Implement a dynamic threshold based on the game's capacity. For example, set the threshold at half of the capacity (capacity/2).
     - If the stock level falls below this threshold, switch to Cooperate (C) to facilitate regrowth and prevent depletion.
       - This ensures that the resource remains viable for future rounds, even if others are defecting.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Last Round (Round r):**
     - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future round to consider stock depletion effects.
     - Rationale: Without subsequent rounds, the focus shifts entirely to maximizing current gain.

4. **Exploitative Mindset Integration:**
   - Continuously assess opponents' strategies by analyzing their past actions and adjusting your strategy accordingly.
   - Balance between exploiting others' cooperation and maintaining resource sustainability to ensure long-term payoffs are maximized.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```
Initialize:
    cooperate = True
    stock_threshold = capacity / 2

For each round from 1 to r:
    if round == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        previous_cooperation_rate = number_of_cooperations_last_round / n
        if stock < stock_threshold:
            action = C
        elif previous_cooperation_rate > 0.5:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D

    if round == r:
        action = D  # Defect in the last round to maximize immediate payoff

    record own action and observe others' actions
    update stock level based on all players' actions
```

**Rationale:**

This strategy begins with cooperation to encourage mutual benefit, then adapts by monitoring both opponents' behavior and resource health. By defecting when cooperation drops or in the final round, it maximizes payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability through dynamic adjustments.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_442 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that balances immediate gains with sustainable use of the resource, we can adopt an adaptive approach based on observed behavior and current stock levels. The strategy is outlined below:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Defection Rate and Stock Levels

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate in the first few rounds (e.g., the first 3 rounds) to encourage others to reciprocate.
   - **Rationale:** Establish a baseline of cooperation, potentially leading to higher sustained payoffs if others follow suit.

2. **Monitoring Defection Rates:**
   - **Tracking:** After the initial phase, monitor the defection rate of other players each round.
   - **Threshold:** If the average defection rate exceeds 30%, switch to defecting in the next rounds.
   - **Rationale:** High defection rates indicate others are prioritizing short-term gains; defecting prevents being exploited.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - **Monitoring:** Continuously track the current stock level after each round.
   - **Action:** If the stock drops below 50% of capacity, increase cooperation to allow regrowth.
   - **Rationale:** Conserving the stock ensures future payoffs; cooperating helps replenish the resource when it's critically low.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - **Last Rounds:** In the final rounds (e.g., last 2 rounds), prioritize defecting to maximize immediate payoffs since there is less concern for future stock levels.
   - **Rationale:** Without future rounds, the focus shifts from sustainability to maximizing current gains.

5. **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**
   - **Continuous Learning:** Adjust the defection threshold dynamically based on observed behavior and stock trends.
   - **Rationale:** Flexibility allows the strategy to respond effectively to changing dynamics in the game.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def adaptive_exploitationStrategy(n, capacity, current_stock, round_num, total_rounds, history):
    # Parameters:
    # n: number of players
    # capacity: maximum stock level
    # current_stock: current stock before this round's actions
    # round_num: current round number (1-indexed)
    # total_rounds: total number of rounds in the game
    # history: list of tuples containing (player_actions, stock_after) for previous rounds

    # Initial Cooperation Phase
    if round_num <= 3:
        return "C"

    # Calculate average defection rate among other players
    def_count = sum(1 for actions in [h[0] for h in history] for a in actions if a == 'D')
    total_actions = len(history) * n
    avg_defection_rate = def_count / total_actions

    # Check stock level
    if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
        cooperation_threshold = 0.3
    else:
        cooperation_threshold = 0.7

    # Determine action based on defection rate and stock level
    if avg_defection_rate > cooperation_threshold:
        return "D"
    elif round_num >= total_rounds - 1:  # Last round
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"

# Example usage in a game loop:
history = []
for t in range(r):
    current_stock = ...  # Obtain from game state
    action = adaptive_exploitationStrategy(n, capacity, current_stock, t+1, r, history)
    # Record the outcome and update history
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages others to cooperate by setting a positive tone early in the game.
- **Defection Rate Monitoring:** Adapts strategy based on others' behavior, preventing exploitation when defection is prevalent.
- **Stock Level Management:** Balances short-term gains with resource sustainability by adjusting actions when stock levels are low.
- **Endgame Focus:** Maximizes payoffs in final rounds without concern for future depletion.

This approach ensures the strategy remains robust against various behaviors while aiming to maximize total payoff over all rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_443 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' reactions.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Threshold:** Monitor the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - If stock > 0.25 * capacity, check the previous round's cooperation rate.
       - If at least half of players cooperated, continue cooperating.
       - If fewer than half cooperated, defect to avoid exploitation.
     - If stock ≤ 0.25 * capacity, defect to maximize short-term gain and prevent further depletion.

3. **Final Round Strategy (Round r):**
   - Always defect in the last round to secure maximum immediate payoff without future consequences.

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages sustainable resource use and sets a cooperative tone.
- **Adaptive Thresholds:** Balances cooperation with strategic defection based on stock sustainability and others' past actions, preventing excessive depletion.
- **Final Round Exploitation:** Maximizes personal gain in the last round when future consequences are absent.

This strategy aims to balance long-term sustainability with opportunistic exploitation, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_444 = '''
To design an effective exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we'll create an adaptive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and the game's state. The strategy aims to maximize payoffs by encouraging cooperation when beneficial and defecting when necessary.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to encourage others to follow suit, promoting a high initial stock level.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players in the previous round.
  - If this rate is above 70% and the current stock exceeds 50% of capacity, cooperate. Otherwise, defect.

#### 2. Edge Cases Handling:
- **Last Round:** Continue using the same decision rules to maintain strategy consistency and avoid sudden shifts that might disadvantage future payoffs.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 30%), prioritize cooperation to replenish it, ensuring sustainable future payoffs.

#### 3. Exploitative Approach:
The strategy exploits others' behavior by adapting to their recent actions. It rewards cooperation with reciprocity and punishes defection by defecting, thus protecting one's share without overly depleting the stock.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def adaptive_cooperation_strategy(n, r, capacity):
    current_stock = capacity
    previous_actions = []
    
    for round in range(1, r+1):
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            # Calculate average cooperation rate of other players last round
            avg_coop_last_round = sum(1 for a in previous_actions[-n:] if a == 'C') / (n - 1)
            
            if current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
                action = 'D'
            elif avg_coop_last_round > 0.7:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'
                
        previous_actions.append(action)
        # Update current_stock based on all players' actions
```

### Explanation:

- **First Round Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to set a collaborative tone.
- **Adaptive Thresholds:** Uses recent behavior (last round's cooperation rate) and stock level to decide the next move, ensuring responsiveness without overreacting.
- **Sustainability Focus:** Prioritizes stock replenishment when levels are low, safeguarding future payoffs.

This strategy is robust and adaptable, balancing immediate gains with long-term sustainability, making it effective against diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_445 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we'll outline a structured approach based on the thought process and considerations discussed. The strategy is designed to be adaptive, robust, and aligned with maximizing payoffs by exploiting opponents' behaviors.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1-3):** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of behavior and help build the stock level.
- **Subsequent Rounds:** 
  - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock is above 60% of capacity, defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, assuming sufficient stock for future rounds.
  - **Low Stock Scenario:** If the stock drops below 40% of capacity, switch to cooperating (C) to help replenish the stock.
- **Opponent Behavior Adaptation:** Track the number of defectors in previous rounds. If more than half defected last round and the stock is above 60%, defect again. If the stock is between 40% and 60%, cooperate if others cooperated more; otherwise, defect.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Start by cooperating to set a positive tone and build initial stock.
- **Last Round (Round r):** Prioritize immediate gain by defecting, as future rounds do not matter anymore.

#### 3. Exploitative Approach:
- Continuously monitor the stock level and opponents' actions to adapt strategies dynamically.
- Use a moving average or decay factor for past actions to weigh recent behavior more heavily in decisions.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
Initialize:
    cooperation_threshold = 0.6 * capacity
    low_stock_threshold = 0.4 * capacity

For each round from 1 to r:
    if current_round == 1 or current_round <= 3:
        action = C
    else:
        previous_actions = get_previous_actions()
        num_defectors = count_defectors(previous_actions)
        
        if stock > cooperation_threshold and num_defectors < n/2:
            action = D
        elif stock < low_stock_threshold or (stock >= low_stock_threshold and num_defectors >= n/2):
            action = C
        
    if current_round == r:
        action = D  # Prioritize immediate gain in the last round

    take_action(action)
    update_history()
```

### Summary:

The strategy starts with cooperation to build stock, then adapts based on stock levels and opponents' past actions. It defects when safe to maximize payoffs and cooperates to sustain the resource when necessary. This balanced approach ensures both immediate gains and long-term sustainability, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_446 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I have developed a comprehensive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoffs while preserving the resource for future rounds through adaptive decision-making.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin by cooperating in the first round to establish trust and encourage others to do the same, thereby maintaining a high stock level.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - Monitor the average consumption per player each round.
   - Compare this average against the cooperative consumption threshold (stock/(2n)).
     - If the average is within an acceptable range (e.g., ≤ 10% above the threshold), continue cooperating.
     - If it exceeds this range, switch to defection for a set number of rounds (e.g., 1-2 rounds) as a punitive measure.

3. **Stock Level Consideration**:
   - Adjust your strategy based on the current stock level relative to capacity.
     - When stock is high (e.g., >80% of capacity), tolerate higher defection levels without retaliating.
     - When stock is moderate or low, enforce stricter cooperation standards to prevent depletion.

4. **Punishment Phase**:
   - Implement a brief period of defection when others' actions indicate excessive exploitation.
   - After punishing, revert to cooperation if others reduce their defection rates.

5. **Stock Threshold Response**:
   - If the stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), defect to maximize immediate payoffs since future rounds are compromised.

6. **Endgame Strategy**: Always defect in the final round to secure maximum personal gain, as there are no subsequent rounds to consider.

### Detailed Strategy:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and maximize initial stock preservation.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the average consumption per player from the previous round.
   - Compare this average to the cooperative threshold (stock/(2n)).
     - If within tolerance, cooperate; otherwise, defect for 1-2 rounds.
3. **Stock Level Adjustment**: Modify your strategy based on stock levels—be more lenient when stock is high and stricter when it's low.
4. **Punishment and Reversion**: Briefly defect to punish exploiters, then revert to cooperation if others comply.
5. **Critical Stock Response**: Defect if stock falls below a critical level (e.g., 20%) to maximize immediate gains.
6. **Final Round**: Always defect in the last round to secure maximum personal payoff.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to the actions of others while safeguarding against resource depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_447 = '''
### Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

#### 1. Decision Rules:
The strategy is adaptive, balancing cooperation with defection based on observed behavior.

- **Initial Rounds (Rounds 1 to r/2):**
  - **Cooperate (C)** to help maintain a healthy stock level, encouraging sustainability.
  - Monitor the number of defectors in each round.

- **Middle Rounds (Rounds r/2 + 1 to r - 2):**
  - If the number of defectors in the previous round exceeds n/2, switch to **Defect (D)** to avoid being exploited.
  - If most players cooperate, continue with **C** to maintain stock health.

- **Final Rounds (Last 2 Rounds):**
  - Shift to **Defect (D)** to maximize immediate payoffs since future stock replenishment becomes less critical.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a cooperative tone and observe others' initial moves.
- **Last Round:** Always Defect to secure the highest possible payoff in the final round.
- **Low Stock Levels (Stock < n):** If stock is critically low, defect to ensure some payoff, as cooperation may yield nothing.

#### 3. Exploitative Approach:
The strategy aligns with an exploitative mindset by initially cooperating to build a sustainable resource base while being prepared to defect when others exploit the system or when the game nears its end to maximize personal gains.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(current_stock, round_number, r, n, history):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    prev_defectors = sum(1 for actions in history[-1] if actions == 'D')
    
    if round_number < (r / 2):
        if prev_defectors > (n / 2):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
    elif round_number >= (r - 2):
        return 'D'
    else:
        if prev_defectors > (n / 2):
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

    # Handle critically low stock
    if current_stock < n:
        return 'D'
```

This strategy ensures adaptability, starting with cooperation to sustain resources, monitoring others' behavior, and shifting to defection when necessary or as the game concludes to exploit remaining opportunities.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_448 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, I have developed a structured approach that balances cooperation and defection based on observed game dynamics. The strategy is adaptive, responding to stock levels and historical behavior while ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies.

### Strategy Overview: "Adaptive Exploitation"

**1. First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Begin by cooperating to establish a baseline of the stock's behavior under cooperative play, allowing observation of others' initial actions without immediately exploiting.

**2. Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Monitoring:**
     - Calculate the percentage change in stock level from the previous round.
     - If the stock decreases by more than 10%, switch to defecting in the next round, as this indicates potential widespread defection.
     - If the stock drops below 20% of capacity, defect to secure immediate payoffs before potential depletion.

   - **Behavioral Adaptation:**
     - Cooperate if the majority of players (based on inferred actions) cooperated in the previous round and the stock remains above the critical threshold.
     - Defect if there's evidence that most players defected or if the stock is depleting rapidly, to avoid being exploited.

**3. Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Always Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff since future consequences are irrelevant after the final round.

### Detailed Decision Rules:

- **First Round:** Cooperate unconditionally to gauge initial system behavior.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  1. Calculate the stock change from the previous round. If the decrease exceeds 10%, defect next round.
  2. Check if the current stock is below 20% of capacity. If so, defect to prevent missing out on remaining resources.
  3. Assess inferred cooperation levels:
     - If most players cooperated and the stock remains healthy, continue cooperating.
     - If significant defection is suspected (from stock depletion), switch to defecting.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Low Stock Levels:** When stock approaches critical thresholds, prioritize immediate payoffs through defection.
- **Final Round:** Maximize extraction regardless of prior actions to ensure highest possible payoff in the last interaction.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and exploitative, leveraging game state and history while remaining robust against diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_449 = '''
To address the strategic considerations for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a comprehensive and adaptive strategy that balances cooperation with self-interest. The strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors while maximizing individual payoffs over multiple rounds.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Threshold Exploitation (ATE)

1. **Initial Cooperation**: 
   - In the first round, Cooperate to initiate trust and maintain a high stock level, ensuring future growth potential.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation**:
   - Track the number of Defectors in previous rounds, focusing on recent history to gauge cooperation levels.
   - Use a threshold-based approach: if more than 50% of players Defected recently, switch to Defecting to protect against exploitation.

3. **Stock Level Consideration**:
   - Continuously monitor the current stock level. If it drops below 25% of capacity, switch to Defecting to maximize immediate gains since future sustainability is compromised.

4. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - In the last round (round r), always Defect to secure maximum short-term payoff, as future rounds do not matter.

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round**: Cooperate.
2. **Middle Rounds (2 to r-1)**:
   - Calculate the proportion of Defectors in recent history (e.g., moving average of past actions).
   - If Defectors exceed 50%, Defect; otherwise, Cooperate.
3. **Last Round (r)**: Always Defect.

### Edge Cases and Considerations

- **Low Stock**: When stock is below 25% of capacity, defect to capture remaining resources.
- **Stock Near Capacity**: Cooperate to sustain high levels and encourage growth.
- **Responsive Adjustments**: Use recent history to avoid being exploited by frequent defectors.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, adapting based on observed behavior and current state to maximize individual payoffs while considering the game's dynamics.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' initial moves.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Track Cooperation Rate:** Calculate the average number of players who cooperated in previous rounds.
     - If the average cooperation rate is above 50%, defect (D) to exploit others' cooperation.
     - If below, switch strategies based on stock levels.
   - **Stock Level Monitoring:** 
     - If stock falls below 30% of capacity, prioritize conservation by cooperating (C).
     - If stock is between 30% and 70% of capacity, use a mixed strategy: cooperate if the cooperation rate is above average; otherwise, defect.
     - If stock exceeds 70%, defect to maximize payoffs.

3. **Last Round Action:**
   - Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds are not a concern.

4. **Adaptive Thresholds:**
   - Use a moving average of past cooperation rates and stock trends to adjust thresholds dynamically.
   - Adjust strategy if the stock's growth rate indicates over-depletion, favoring conservation by cooperating more frequently.

This strategy balances exploitation with conservation, adapting to both opponents' behavior and the game's state to optimize long-term payoffs while being robust against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_451 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Current Stock (S) vs. Capacity:** If S is above 75% of capacity, defect (D). Below this threshold, cooperate (C).
   - **History of Actions:** Examine the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than half defected, choose to defect in the current round.

2. **Adaptation:**
   - Adjust the strategy dynamically based on observed actions and stock levels. Use past behavior to inform future decisions without assuming others' strategies.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to observe initial behavior of other players.
   - **Last Round:** Maximize immediate payoff by defecting if S allows, ensuring no negative impact on the final outcome.

This strategy balances exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs with maintaining resource sustainability, adapting based on both environmental state and competitors' actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_452 = '''
To design an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that adapts to both the current stock level and the behavior of other players. The goal is to maximize individual payoffs while ensuring the sustainability of the common pool over multiple rounds.

### Strategy Overview:
The strategy combines elements of reciprocity with opportunistic exploitation. It starts cooperatively but adaptively switches to defection based on observed behavior and resource levels, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies.

### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation helps maintain a high stock level, encouraging a positive start and potentially influencing others' behaviors positively.

2. **Middle Rounds:**
   - **Monitor Previous Consumption:** Calculate the average consumption per player from the last round.
     - If this average exceeds a threshold (e.g., 0.75), switch to Defect (D) in the next round to avoid being exploited by others' greed.
   - **Stock Level Consideration:**
     - If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity), defect if others are exploiting, but cooperate if others are conservative.
     - If the stock is below this threshold, consider cooperating to help replenish it, especially if others show cooperative tendencies.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (approximately the final 20%), switch to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs since future sustainability becomes less relevant.

### Edge Cases Handling:
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock drops significantly, prioritize cooperation temporarily to allow replenishment unless others continue to defect excessively.
- **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize final payoff without concern for future rounds.

This strategy is adaptive and exploitative, balancing between maintaining resource sustainability and capitalizing on opportunities when others are over-exploiting. It ensures that the player can adapt effectively to various behaviors while maximizing their own payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_453 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, I propose the following approach:

1. **Initial Rounds (First 2-3 Rounds):**
   - Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' behavior without immediately exploiting.

2. **Adaptive Strategy Based on Stock Levels:**
   - **Stock Threshold:** Use a threshold of 75% of the capacity.
     - If stock > 75% of capacity, Cooperate to maintain sustainability.
     - If stock ≤ 75%, Defect to maximize immediate payoff while stock is still sufficient.

3. **Response to Others' Actions:**
   - Track the moving average of others' defection rates over the past few rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds).
     - If the average defection rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 50%), increase defection to avoid being exploited.
     - If the rate is below, consider maintaining cooperation if stock levels are healthy.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last 2-3 rounds, shift towards Defecting regardless of other factors since future growth won't benefit you after the game ends.

5. **Robustness Considerations:**
   - The strategy should be flexible to handle various opponent behaviors without relying on specific coordination.
   - Continuously monitor stock levels and adjust actions to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

    current_stock = stock
    capacity_threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    
    if current_stock > capacity_threshold:
        # Cooperate to maintain stock
        return "C"
    else:
        # Consider others' recent actions
        recent_defections = count_defects_in_last_x_rounds(history, x=2)
        defect_rate = recent_defections / (n * x)
        
        if defect_rate > 0.5:
            return "D"
        else:
            # Check endgame condition
            if round >= total_rounds - endgame_threshold:
                return "D"
            else:
                return "C" if current_stock > capacity_threshold else "D"

# Parameters to tune:
initial_coop_rounds = 2
endgame_threshold = 3
```

This strategy balances initial cooperation with adaptive responses based on stock health and others' behavior, ensuring robustness against various opponent strategies while maximizing payoff over the game's duration.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_454 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a comprehensive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection. The strategy adapts based on game history and state, ensuring robustness against various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Initial Rounds**: Begin by Cooperating in the first few rounds to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' behavior. This phase sets the stage for potential mutual benefit while gathering data on other players' actions.

2. **Stock Level Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the current stock level relative to capacity. If the stock drops below a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to Cooperating to allow regrowth and sustain future rounds.

3. **Adaptive Decision Making**:
   - Calculate the average cooperation rate from previous rounds. If the majority of players have been cooperating, continue Cooperating.
   - If the cooperation rate falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 70%), switch to Defecting to protect your payoffs and prevent stock depletion.

4. **Punishment Mechanism**: Implement a system where if other players' defection leads to significant stock reduction, respond by Defecting in subsequent rounds to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

5. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final round, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no future consequences for stock depletion.

### Detailed Pseudocode:

```
Parameters:
- n: Number of players
- r: Number of rounds
- capacity: Maximum stock level

State Variables:
- current_stock: Current stock level
- history: List of past cooperation rates (cooperations/total_actions)

Thresholds:
- STOCK_THRESHOLD = 0.5 * capacity
- COOPERATION_THRESHOLD = 0.7

Strategy:

Initialize history as empty list.

For each round from 1 to r:
    If it's the first round or round < initial_coop_rounds:
        Action = C
    Else if current_stock < STOCK_THRESHOLD:
        Action = C
    Else:
        cooperation_rate = average(history)
        If cooperation_rate > COOPERATION_THRESHOLD:
            Action = C
        Else:
            Action = D

    Record own action in history.

    After all actions are taken, update history with others' actions observed.

In last round (r):
    Action = D

Update history after each round.
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: By starting with cooperation, the strategy encourages others to reciprocate and builds a foundation for sustained resource use.
- **Stock Threshold**: When stock is low, prioritizing cooperation helps in regrowth, ensuring future rounds have sufficient resources.
- **Adaptive Cooperation Rate**: Responding to the average cooperation rate incentivizes others to maintain cooperation, while switching to defection when necessary protects against exploitation.
- **Endgame Defection**: Maximizing payoff in the last round without concern for future consequences is a strategic move to capitalize on remaining resources.

This strategy effectively balances exploitation and conservation, adapting dynamically based on game state and history. It encourages cooperation while safeguarding against excessive defection, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_455 = '''
To address the problem of determining the optimal strategy for each round based on the dynamic stock level and opponents' past actions, we can outline a structured approach. This strategy aims to balance between exploiting others' cooperation and maintaining a healthy stock level for future rounds.

### Strategy Outline:

1. **First Round:**
   - Always cooperate. This helps establish a high initial stock level, which is beneficial for all players in subsequent rounds.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - Calculate the cooperation rate of other players from the previous round.
     - Cooperation Rate = (Number of opponents who cooperated last round) / (Total number of opponents)
   - Determine the current stock level relative to a threshold (half of capacity).
   - If both conditions are met:
     - The cooperation rate is above 50%.
     - The current stock level exceeds half of the maximum capacity.
     Then, choose to defect in the current round. This allows you to take advantage of others' cooperation while the stock can sustain it.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to help maintain or rebuild the stock.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - Always defect. Since there are no future rounds, maximizing immediate payoff is optimal without worrying about depleting the stock beyond recovery.

### Rationale:

- **First Round Cooperation:** Sets a positive tone and ensures a strong starting point for resource accumulation.
  
- **Exploitation in Intermediate Rounds:** By defecting when others have cooperated and the stock is healthy, you maximize your gains while relying on others to sustain the resource.
  
- **Conservation When Necessary:** Cooperating when the stock is low or when others are not cooperating helps prevent rapid depletion, ensuring resources remain available for future exploitation.

This strategy effectively balances between self-interest and resource sustainability, making it a robust approach in dynamic environments with multiple players.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_456 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round while balancing immediate gains and long-term resource sustainability, I propose the following structured approach:

1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C) to observe others' behavior and calculate the initial number of defectors.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Until Last Round)**:
   - Calculate the number of defectors from the previous round using observed total consumption.
   - If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, choose to Defect (D) in the current round.
   - Otherwise, check the current stock level:
     - If the stock is above 75% of capacity, Cooperate (C).
     - If the stock is below or equal to 75%, Defect (D).

3. **Last Round Action**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds.

This strategy aims to exploit when others are defecting while conserving resources when necessary, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and sustained resource availability for higher total payoffs across all rounds.

**Answer**:  
The optimal strategy is: Cooperate in the first round. In subsequent rounds, defect if more than half defected previously; otherwise, cooperate if stock is above 75% of capacity, else defect. Always defect in the last round. Thus, your final answer is to follow this adaptive approach, encapsulated as \boxed{D} in the last round and conditionally in others based on observed behavior and resource level.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_457 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold (ACST)**

1. **Initial Decision (First Round):**
   - Cooperate (C) to initiate mutual cooperation and preserve the stock for future rounds.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   a. **Majority Action Rule:**
      - Observe the actions of all players in the previous round.
      - If more than half of the players defected (D), choose to Defect (D) in the current round.
      - Otherwise, Cooperate (C).

   b. **Stock Level Threshold:**
      - Define a threshold stock level (e.g., 20% of capacity). If the stock drops below this threshold:
        - Cooperate (C) to allow stock recovery, regardless of others' actions.

3. **Final Round Decision (Round r):**
   - Assess the current stock level and recent behavior.
     - If the stock is above the threshold and most players cooperated in the previous round, Cooperate (C).
     - Otherwise, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.

**Rationale:**
- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages others to cooperate, maintaining a healthy stock.
- **Adaptive Response:** Adjusts strategy based on collective behavior, deterring exploitation and promoting sustainability.
- **Stock Preservation:** Ensures the resource isn't depleted beyond recovery by prioritizing cooperation when stock is low.

**Implementation:**
- Track previous actions and current stock levels.
- Apply majority rule with a stock threshold to decide each round's action.
- Adjust strategy in the final round based on stock health and prior behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_458 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Always cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' initial moves.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:**
     - **Upper Threshold (75% of capacity):** If the stock is above this level, check the number of players who defected in the previous round. If fewer than half defected, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
     - **Lower Threshold (25% of capacity):** If the stock falls below this level, switch to defection (D) to maximize immediate payoffs as the stock is critically low.
   - **Last Round:** Always defect (D) since there's no future benefit from cooperation.

2. **Adaptation Mechanism:**
   - Monitor the stock level and opponents' actions each round.
   - Calculate thresholds relative to capacity.
   - Count previous defections to determine strategic shifts.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **Stock Depletion:** If stock is zero, defect as there's no resource to exploit.
   - **Last Round:** Prioritize immediate gain by defecting regardless of history.

This strategy balances cooperation for sustainability with timely defection to exploit resources when necessary, ensuring adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_459 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a comprehensive approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection to maximize payoffs. Here's a structured strategy based on the thought process:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Protection

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Begin by cooperating to establish a sustainable stock level and encourage initial cooperation among players.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making (Subsequent Rounds, excluding Last Round):**
   - **Parameters:**
     - **Recent Defection Threshold:** 30% of other players' actions in the last 5 rounds.
     - **Stock Threshold:** 20% of the capacity.
   - **Action Rules:**
     - If more than 30% of other players defected in the recent past OR the current stock is below 20% of capacity, choose Defect (D).
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating (C).

3. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - **Action:** Always Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** In the final round, prioritize immediate payoff maximization since there are no future rounds to consider.

4. **Monitoring and Adaptation:**
   - Maintain a history of recent defections (e.g., last 5 rounds) to assess others' behavior trends.
   - Continuously monitor the stock level to determine if conservation is necessary.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(n, capacity, r):
    # Initialize variables
    cooperate = True
    history_defections = []
    stock_threshold = 0.2 * capacity

    for t in range(1, r + 1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'C'
        elif t == r:
            action = 'D'
        else:
            # Calculate recent defection rate
            recent_defections = sum(history_defections[-5:]) if len(history_defections) > 0 else 0
            recent_defect_rate = recent_defections / (5 * n)
            
            current_stock = get_current_stock()
            
            if recent_defect_rate > 0.3 or current_stock < stock_threshold:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'C'

        # Record the number of defectors in this round
        num_defectors = count_defectors(t)
        history_defections.append(num_defectors)

    return action

# Helper functions (assumed to be implemented elsewhere):
def get_current_stock():
    # Returns current stock level
    pass

def count_defectors(round):
    # Counts number of players who defected in the given round
    pass
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to build a sustainable resource base.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Uses recent behavior and stock levels to decide actions, balancing between maintaining the stock and exploiting others' cooperation.
- **Last Round Defection:** Maximizes immediate payoff in the final round without concern for future depletion.

This strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, ensuring both exploitation of cooperative tendencies and protection against resource exhaustion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_460 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a approach that balances cooperation with strategic exploitation based on observed outcomes. The strategy should adapt to the behavior of other players while ensuring long-term payoff maximization.

### Strategy Design:

1. **First Round:**
   - Cooperate (C): This sets a cooperative tone and avoids immediate depletion of the stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (t = 2 to r-1):**
   - **Check Stock Threshold:** After each round, observe the stock level after consumption and growth.
   - If the stock falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., capacity / 2), switch strategy to Defect (D) for subsequent rounds. This indicates that other players are exploiting the resource heavily.

3. **Last Round (t = r):**
   - Always Defect (D): In the final round, maximize immediate payoff since there are no future consequences.

### Rationale:

- **Cooperation in Early Rounds:** Starting with cooperation encourages others to do the same, maintaining a healthy stock level.
- **Adaptive Switching:** By monitoring the stock level, the strategy detects when exploitation by others is excessive and switches to defecting to protect its own payoffs.
- **Exploitation in Last Round:** Defecting in the last round ensures maximum immediate gain without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round
        return 'C'
    else:
        current_round = len(history) + 1
        previous_stock = history[-1]['stock_after']
        threshold = capacity / 2
        
        if current_round < r:
            if previous_stock < threshold:
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'C'
        else:  # Last round
            return 'D'
```

### Conclusion:

This strategy is designed to be exploitative by initially cooperating but switching to defecting when the stock level indicates significant exploitation by others. It balances cooperation and self-interest, adapting based on observed game state changes.

To determine whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round of the game, we'll follow a strategic approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability of the resource. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C). This allows us to observe the initial impact on the stock and other players' behaviors without immediately depleting resources.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Until the Penultimate Round:**
   - If the current stock level (S_t) is above 80% of the capacity, choose to Defect (D). This exploits the resource when it's plentiful, ensuring a higher immediate payoff while still maintaining a buffer for future rounds.
   - If the current stock level is 80% or below, Cooperate (C). This helps preserve the stock for future rounds, preventing premature depletion.

3. **Last Round:** Always Defect (D). Since there are no future consequences beyond this round, maximize your immediate payoff without concern for resource sustainability.

**Summary:**

- **Round 1:** C
- **Rounds 2 to r-1:** D if S_t > 0.8 * capacity; otherwise, C
- **Round r (Last Round):** D

This strategy aims to optimize your total payoff by strategically choosing when to exploit the resource and when to conserve it based on its current state.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_462 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that considers both immediate gains and long-term sustainability. The strategy should adapt based on observed behavior and stock levels. Here's a structured plan:

### Exploitative Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation-Defection (ACD)

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **Initial Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - If the stock level after the previous round is below half the capacity (S < C/2), Cooperate to help replenish the stock.
     - If the stock level is at or above half the capacity (S ≥ C/2), Defect to maximize immediate payoff, especially as the game progresses towards later rounds.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate to initiate resource sustainability.
   - **Last Round:** Defect to maximize personal gain since there are no future consequences beyond the current round.
   - **Low Stock Levels (S ≤ C/4):** Switch to Cooperate consistently until the stock recovers above C/2.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
   - The strategy exploits others' behavior by defecting when the stock is sufficiently high, taking advantage of over-consumption while ensuring some level of resource conservation.
   - It balances short-term gains with long-term sustainability by adjusting actions based on current stock levels and proximity to the end of the game.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def a strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    if it's the first round:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        current_stock = get_current_stock()
        remaining_rounds = r - current_round
        if current_stock < capacity / 2:
            # Conserve stock by cooperating
            return Cooperate
        elif current_stock >= capacity / 2 and remaining_rounds <= r / 2:
            # Exploit in later rounds when stock is sufficient
            return Defect
        else:
            # Mix strategy based on past defections
            past_defections = count_defections(history)
            if past_defections > n / 2:
                return Defect
            else:
                return Cooperate

    # Last round handling
    if it's the last round:
        return Defect
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Sets a cooperative tone, encouraging resource sustainability.
- **Stock-Based Adaptation:** Adjusts behavior based on stock levels to prevent depletion while allowing exploitation when safe.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Shifts towards defection in later rounds to maximize payoffs without concern for future rounds.
- **Punishment Mechanism:** Defects more if others are observed defecting frequently, discouraging excessive exploitation.

This strategy aims to maximize personal payoff by strategically choosing when to cooperate and defect, ensuring a balance between immediate gains and maintaining the resource for future rounds.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_463 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round**: Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' actions.
   
   - **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
     - If the current stock level \( S \) is below 30% of the capacity, choose to Cooperate to help the stock recover.
     - Otherwise, calculate the average number of Defectors (\( D_{avg} \)) from all previous rounds. If \( D_{avg} > \frac{n}{2} \), where \( n \) is the number of players, then Defect to exploit others' cooperation. Otherwise, Cooperate.

   - **Last Round (r)**: Always choose to Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round**: Start with Cooperation to gauge others' strategies.
   - **Low Stock Levels**: Prioritize stock recovery by Cooperating if \( S < 0.3 \times \text{capacity} \).
   - **Last Round**: Maximize immediate gain regardless of stock level.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
   The strategy adapts based on observed behavior, exploiting situations where others are defecting frequently while preserving the resource when necessary. By using thresholds for stock levels and average defections, it balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability.

This approach ensures robustness against various opponent behaviors, leveraging perfect information to make informed decisions each round.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_464 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to cooperate or defect in a repeated game with a shared resource, we can develop a strategy that balances maintaining the resource for future rounds while maximizing immediate gains when necessary. The approach involves monitoring the stock level trends and adjusting actions based on these observations.

### Strategy Overview
1. **First Round**: Cooperate to start with maximum stock.
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**: Track the trend of the stock levels over the last few rounds. If the stock is consistently decreasing, switch to defecting; otherwise, continue cooperating.
3. **Last Round (Round r)**: Always defect to maximize immediate gain since there are no future rounds to consider.

### Detailed Strategy
1. **First Round**: Cooperate by taking the smaller share to encourage a high initial stock level.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Monitor the stock levels after each round to determine if they are increasing or decreasing.
   - If the stock has decreased in the majority of the last few rounds (e.g., 2 out of the last 3), switch strategy to defecting.
   - Continue cooperating as long as the stock remains stable or increases, indicating sufficient replenishment.
3. **Final Round**: In the last round, always take the larger share (defect) to maximize immediate payoff.

This approach ensures that while we aim to maintain a sustainable resource level by cooperating when possible, we also protect ourselves from being exploited if others defect frequently and switch strategies accordingly.

**Objective:**  
To maximize total payoff over all rounds while maintaining stock sustainability, ensuring long-term resource availability without assuming others' cooperation.

---

### **1. Decision Rules**

#### **A. Conservation Threshold**
- **If Stock ≤ 50% of Capacity (S ≤ 0.5 * capacity):**
  - **Cooperate (C)** to reduce consumption and allow stock recovery.
- **Else:**
  - **Defect (D)** to maximize immediate payoff.

#### **B. Cooperation Incentive Based on History**
- Calculate the average cooperation rate of all players in previous rounds using an exponential moving average.
- **If Average Cooperation Rate ≥ 50%:** Cooperate in the next round to encourage sustainability.
- **Else:** Defect to avoid exploitation.

---

### **2. Edge Cases**

#### **A. First Round**
- **Action:** Cooperate (C) unconditionally.
  - Rationale: Establish a baseline of cooperation to encourage others and conserve stock initially.

#### **B. Last Round (Round r)**
- **Action:** Defect (D).
  - Rationale: Maximize immediate payoff since there’s no future impact on the stock.

---

### **3. Exploitative Approach**

#### **A. Reactive Strategy Based on Stock Dynamics**
1. **Monitor Stock Levels:** Track current stock and its trend over time.
2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - If stock is declining due to high defection, increase cooperation to stabilize the stock.
   - If stock is stable or increasing, defect strategically to maximize payoffs.

#### **B. Punishment Mechanism**
- **Identify Consistent Defectors:** Track players who defect repeatedly despite sufficient stock levels.
- **Retaliate Against Defectors:** Temporarily defect when interacting with known defectors to punish non-cooperative behavior.

---

### **4. Robustness and Adaptability**

#### **A. Smooth Transition Between Strategies**
- Use a weighted average or moving window to decide the proportion of cooperation vs. defection based on recent history, rather than abrupt shifts.

#### **B. Handle Mixed Strategies**
- If some players cooperate while others defect:
  - Calculate the ratio of cooperators to defectors in the previous round.
  - Adjust current strategy: Cooperate more if a majority cooperated; otherwise, defect.

### **6. Strategy Explanation**

This strategy is designed to balance immediate payoff maximization with long-term stock sustainability. It uses a combination of reactive and proactive elements:

1. **Conservation Threshold:** Ensures that when the stock is low, players cooperate to allow recovery.
2. **Cooperation Incentive:** Encourages cooperation if others are cooperative, fostering mutual benefit.
3. **Exploitative Punishment:** Defects when others are non-cooperative to avoid being exploited.
4. **Smooth Transitions:** Uses probabilities to gradually shift between cooperation and defection based on history.
5. **Robustness:** Handles edge cases like the first and last rounds explicitly, ensuring optimal decisions at critical points.

This approach is robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors while maintaining adaptability to changing conditions in the game.

To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can outline a structured approach that balances cooperation and defection based on game state and history.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation Strategy (AES)

The AES strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff while maintaining the sustainability of the common pool resource. It adapts based on the current stock level, the number of remaining rounds, and the past actions of other players.

#### 1. Decision Rules:

- **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe others' behavior.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - **Stock Level Consideration:**
    - If the current stock is above 75% of capacity, check the last round's actions:
      - If most players (more than half) cooperated, continue cooperating.
      - If many defected, switch to defecting in this round.
    - If the stock is below 75%, prioritize defection to maximize immediate payoff, especially if fewer rounds remain.

- **Retaliation Mechanism:** 
  - If any player defected in the previous round, defect in the current round. However, limit retaliation to avoid over-depletion.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

- **Last Round:** Always defect to maximize immediate gain since there's no future stock to preserve.
  
- **Low Stock Levels:** When stock is critically low (below 25% of capacity), prioritize defection to secure whatever remains.

#### 3. Exploitative Mindset:

- **Adaptation:** Continuously monitor the stock and others' actions to switch strategies as needed.
- **Retaliation:** Punish defectors to deter future exploitation but avoid prolonged punishment that harms everyone.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_exploitation_strategy(game_state, history):
    n = game_state['n']
    r = game_state['r']
    current_round = game_state['current_round']
    stock = game_state['stock']
    capacity = game_state['capacity']
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Determine threshold
    threshold = 0.75 * capacity
    
    # Check if this is the last round
    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'
    
    # Get last round's actions and stock level
    last_actions = history['actions'][current_round - 2]
    last_stock = history['stock_levels'][current_round - 2]
    
    # Count defectors in last round
    num_defectors_last = sum(1 for action in last_actions if action == 'D')
    
    # Stock-based decision
    if stock > threshold:
        # Most players cooperated last round (less than n/2 defected)
        if num_defectors_last < n / 2:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else:
        return 'D'
    
    # Additionally, check if any player defected last round for retaliation
    # Simple retaliation: defect once after being defected against
    if any(action == 'D' for action in last_actions):
        return 'D'
    
    # Fallback to cooperation
    return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to encourage initial sustainability.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Adjust strategy based on stock levels; cooperate when the stock is healthy, defect when it's depleted.
- **Retaliation:** Defect once after others have defected to discourage exploitation without causing prolonged damage.
- **Endgame Strategy:** Maximize payoff in the last round by defecting.

This strategy aims to balance immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to the game's progression and opponents' actions.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Strategy Overview:**
The strategy is designed to balance exploitation and conservation by adapting to both the stock level and opponents' past actions. It aims to maximize personal payoff while maintaining the stock for future rounds.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) to avoid initial over-depletion and encourage cooperation among others.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock is below 30% of capacity, choose Cooperate (C) to allow stock regrowth.
   - **Opponent Behavior Analysis:** Calculate the average cooperation rate of all other players from previous rounds. If more than 50% have Cooperated in past rounds, Defect (D) to exploit their cooperation. Otherwise, Cooperate (C).

3. **Exploitation Testing:**
   - Periodically, every few rounds, test by Defecting once to gauge if others' cooperation can be exploited without significant stock harm.

4. **Final Round Action:**
   - Always Defect (D) in the last round to maximize immediate payoff since future stock preservation is unnecessary.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Track each player's actions and the stock level from previous rounds.
   - Set a stock threshold at 30% of capacity.

2. **Round Execution:**
   - For each round after the first, evaluate the current stock level and opponents' past cooperation rate.
   - Decide action based on the above criteria.

3. **Adaptive Adjustments:**
   - Periodically test exploitation by Defecting once to assess impact on payoff and stock.
   - Adjust strategy dynamically if needed based on observed outcomes.

**Edge Cases Handling:**

- **Low Stock:** Prioritize conservation by Cooperating when stock is critically low.
- **Majority Cooperation:** Exploit by Defecting when others are mostly Cooperative.
- **Final Round:** Maximize immediate gain without concern for future stock.

This strategy ensures a balance between exploiting opponents' cooperation and conserving the resource, adapting dynamically to maintain robust performance against various behaviors.

To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, I propose the following structured approach:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation and Sustainability

1. **Initial Rounds (First 10% of Total Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establish a baseline of cooperation to encourage others to reciprocate, promoting stock sustainability.

2. **Monitoring Cooperation Rate:**
   - **Threshold:** 50% Cooperation Rate
     - **If >50% Cooperate:** Switch to Defect (D) to exploit others' cooperation for higher immediate payoffs.
     - **If ≤50% Cooperate:** Continue with Cooperate (C) to maintain stock levels and encourage others.

3. **Stock Management:**
   - **Threshold:** 80% of Capacity
     - **If Stock < 80%:** Switch to Cooperate (C) to allow stock recovery.
     - **If Stock ≥80%:** Consider defecting if cooperation rate allows, ensuring sustainable exploitation.

4. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - **Trigger:** Stock drops below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity).
   - **Action:** Cooperate for the next few rounds to reduce consumption and facilitate recovery.

5. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - **If Stock ≥80% Capacity:** Defect (D) to maximize payoffs.
   - **If Stock <80% Capacity:** Cooperate (C) to ensure stock availability for future exploitation, even in the final rounds.

### Decision Rules:

- **Cooperate** if fewer than 50% of players are defecting and the stock is below 80% capacity.
- **Defect** if more than 50% of players are cooperating and the stock is above 80% capacity.
- **Punish** by cooperating for a few rounds if the stock drops critically low due to others' defection.

### Edge Cases:

- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to set a cooperative tone.
- **Last Round:** Defect if stock allows; otherwise, Cooperate to preserve stock.
- **Low Stock Situations:** Prioritize stock recovery by Cooperating when necessary.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting to the dynamics of other players' actions while safeguarding against stock depletion.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_469 = '''
**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start with cooperation to observe other players' reactions and establish a baseline for future decisions.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
   - **Calculate Others' Average Action:** Determine the average consumption per player from the previous round.
     - If the average consumption is closer to C (i.e., lower), most players cooperated.
     - If higher, leaning towards D, most defected.
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** Compare the current stock level after growth to a threshold (e.g., 70% of capacity).
     - **If Stock ≥ 70% and Most Cooperated:** Continue cooperating to maintain a healthy stock.
     - **If Stock < 70% or Many Defected:** Switch to defecting to exploit the situation for higher immediate gains.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Always Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider stock depletion effects.

4. **Stock Monitoring:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level after each round's growth.
   - Adjust cooperation or defection based on whether the stock is above or below the set threshold, balancing long-term sustainability with short-term gains.

This strategy adapts to both the stock's state and others' actions, ensuring exploitative moves that maximize personal payoffs while considering the game's dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_470 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Punishment (AEP)**

1. **Initial Rounds:**
   - **First Round:** Always Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and observe others' actions.

2. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - If the current stock exceeds 75% of capacity, Defect (D) to maximize immediate gains while the resource is plentiful.
   - If the stock is below or equal to 75%, proceed to evaluate recent opponent behavior.

3. **Recent History Evaluation:**
   - Track the number of players who defected in the last round.
     - If more than half defected, Defect in the current round to punish and deter future exploitation.
     - If half or fewer defected, Cooperate (C) to sustain resource levels.

4. **Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Implement a retaliatory response if previous rounds resulted in significant stock depletion due to opponents' defection.

5. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., last 2-3 rounds), prioritize defecting if stock levels allow, ensuring maximal payoff without future consequences.
   - If stock is critically low, Cooperate to secure remaining payoffs instead of risking total depletion.

6. **Adaptive Thresholds:**
   - Adjust stock thresholds based on observed opponent behavior. Lower the threshold for defecting if opponents are cooperative, and raise it if they tend to defect frequently.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate to initiate cooperation.
- **Last Round(s):** Defect strategically if beneficial, considering stock levels and previous actions.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainable resource management, adapting dynamically to opponent behaviors while maintaining a robust response mechanism.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_471 = '''
To address the problem of deciding when to cooperate or defect in a repeated game to maximize payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability, we developed a strategy that balances immediate gains with long-term resource health. The approach integrates monitoring of other players' behavior and current resource levels to make informed decisions.

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating for the first few rounds to encourage others and maintain high resource levels.
2. **Monitor Behavior and Resource Levels:** Track recent defections and current stock levels to determine if exploitation is occurring.
3. **Threshold-Based Decision Making:** Defect if a significant number of players have defected recently or if the resource level drops below a safe threshold.
4. **Punishment Phase:** Once defecting starts, continue for a few rounds to penalize exploiters before reassessing.
5. **Final Rounds:** Always defect in the last few rounds to maximize immediate payoffs since future sustainability is no longer a concern.

### Solution Code:
```python
def strategy(n, total_rounds, capacity, history):
    """
    Decide whether to Cooperate or Defect based on recent defection rates and stock levels.
    
    Parameters:
    - n: number of players
    - total_rounds: total number of rounds in the game
    - capacity: initial stock level
    - history: list of dictionaries with 'stock' (current stock) and 'actions' (list of actions per player)
    
    Returns: "Cooperate" or "Defect"
    """
    current_round = len(history)
    if current_round == 0:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    recent_defectors = []
    stock_levels = [history[0]['stock']]
    
    for i in range(1, len(history)):
        # Count number of defectors in this round (excluding self)
        defectors = sum(1 for action in history[i]['actions'] if action == 'Defect')
        recent_defectors.append(defectors)
        stock_levels.append(history[i]['stock'])
    
    if current_round < 3:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Calculate average defectors in last 3 rounds
    avg_defectors = sum(recent_defectors[-3:]) / 3
    
    current_stock = history[-1]['stock']
    
    # Check conditions to defect
    if avg_defectors > n/2 or current_stock < 0.5 * capacity:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    # Additionally, in the last few rounds, always defect
    if current_round >= total_rounds - 3:
        return "Defect"
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Rounds:** The strategy begins by cooperating to set a cooperative tone and maintain high stock levels.
- **Behavior Monitoring:** After the initial period, it calculates the average number of defectors in recent rounds. If this exceeds half the players or the stock drops below 50% of capacity, it switches to defecting.
- **Stock Level Check:** Ensures that if the resource is depleting significantly, the strategy defects to secure payoffs before the stock dwindles further.
- **Final Rounds Adjustment:** In the last few rounds, it defects to maximize immediate gains since future sustainability no longer matters.

This approach dynamically adapts to others' actions and the resource's state, aiming to balance cooperation for sustained benefits with strategic defection to prevent exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_472 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, here's a structured approach:

### Strategy Overview
The strategy balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by adapting based on the current stock level and opponents' past actions. It employs a mix of cooperation and defection to exploit high stock levels while preserving the resource for future rounds.

### Decision Rules

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establishes a baseline, encouraging potential cooperation from others without risking immediate depletion.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):**
   - **Monitor Previous Actions:** Track the number of defections in the last round.
   - **Defection Threshold:** If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect this round.
   - **Stock Level Check:** If the stock is below 50% of capacity, cooperate to allow regrowth. Otherwise, defect.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff as future rounds no longer matter.

### Adaptive Elements
- **Stock Thresholds:** Cooperate if stock drops below 50% of capacity to encourage replenishment.
- **Responsive Behavior:** Adjust actions based on the majority's previous behavior, defecting if others defected heavily last round.

### Robustness Considerations
- **Tit-for-Tat Element:** Respond to opponents' defections by defecting, while cooperating when others do so.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Use moving averages or trends over multiple rounds to inform decisions, allowing flexibility as the game progresses.

This strategy aims to exploit opportunities for higher payoffs while maintaining resource sustainability, ensuring a balance between short-term gains and long-term benefits.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_473 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Start by Cooperating (C) in the first round to establish a baseline of behavior without prior information.

2. **Monitoring Mechanisms:**
   - Track the stock level after each round to assess depletion.
   - Estimate the number of defectors based on the total consumption, inferred from the remaining stock and growth.

3. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Critical Stock Threshold:** Define a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity). If the stock falls below this, switch to Defecting (D) to prevent further depletion.
   - **Defection Rate Indicator:** Calculate the estimated number of defectors each round. If the rate exceeds a set percentage (e.g., 50%), defect in the subsequent round.
   - **Last Round Strategy:** In the final round, always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

4. **Adaptive Adjustments:**
   - Continuously update your strategy based on observed stock levels and estimated defection rates from previous rounds.

5. **Implementation Logic:**

```
Initialize:
    cooperation_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    last_round = False

For each round t from 1 to r:
    If t == 1:
        Choose action C
    Else:
        Estimate number of defectors based on previous stock changes
        If current_stock < cooperation_threshold or defectors > 0.5*n:
            Choose action D
        Else:
            Choose action C

    If t == r:
        Choose action D

Update:
    Record current_stock and estimated_defectors for next round
```

This strategy balances immediate gain with sustainability, adapting to others' actions while ensuring robust performance across various scenarios in the tournament.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_474 = '''
**Strategy Design: Adaptive Exploitation for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Strategy Overview:**
The strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by balancing cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and resource sustainability.

**2. Decision Rules:**

- **Initial Rounds (t = 1):**
  - Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative baseline and preserve the stock for future rounds.

- **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
  - Calculate the average payoff of other players from previous rounds.
  - If others' average payoff exceeds a threshold (indicating frequent defection), switch to Defect (D).
  - Monitor the current stock level. If it falls below a critical threshold, defect to maximize immediate gain.

- **Final Round (t = r):**
  - Always Defect (D) to secure maximum possible payoff as future rounds don't matter.

**3. Parameters:**

- **Cooperation Threshold:** Adjust based on stock recovery rate and number of players.
- **Stock Threshold:** Set to trigger defection when sustainability is at risk.

**4. Edge Cases Handling:**
- For small n (e.g., n=2), adjust thresholds to prevent rapid depletion.
- When capacity is minimal, prioritize cooperation initially but switch quickly if others defect.

**5. Pseudocode Implementation:**

```
Initialize action = C
For each round from 1 to r:
    If it's the first round:
        Choose C
    Else if it's the last round:
        Choose D
    Else:
        Calculate others' average past payoff
        If others' average > threshold or stock < critical level:
            Choose D
        Else:
            Choose C

Adjust thresholds dynamically based on observed behavior and stock trends.
```

**6. Strategy Rationale:**
This approach starts cooperatively to sustain the resource but adapts by defecting when others exploit excessively or when the stock is endangered, ensuring a balance between immediate gain and future sustainability. The final round defection maximizes payoff without regard for future consequences.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_475 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Decision Rule:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This starts the game conservatively, promoting initial resource conservation and maximizing collective payoff.

2. **Adaptive Strategy Based on Consumption Patterns:**
   - **Monitor Average Consumption:** Track each player's average consumption per round.
   - **Threshold Check:** If the average exceeds 2/3 of capacity divided by the number of rounds, switch to Defect (D) in the subsequent round.

3. **Historical Defection Analysis:**
   - **Defection Ratio:** Calculate the ratio of times other players chose D. Exceeding a threshold (e.g., 50%) triggers a strategic shift towards D.

4. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - **Low Stock Alert:** If stock falls below 20% of capacity, defect to maximize immediate payoff before potential depletion.

5. **Final Round Strategy:**
   - **Last Round Defection:** In the final round, always choose D to exploit the maximum possible resources without future repercussions.

6. **Payoff-Based Adaptation:**
   - **Recent Payoffs Assessment:** If recent payoffs are consistently low due to others' defections, adjust strategy more frequently towards D to avoid being exploited.

This strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors while aiming to maximize individual payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_476 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed a balanced approach that considers both the game's state and opponents' historical actions. The strategy aims to maximize payoffs while maintaining the stock for future rounds.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation with Stock Threshold and Historical Defection Response

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Establish a cooperative tone to maintain a healthy stock level from the start, allowing observation of others' initial actions without immediate exploitation.

2. **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, defect (D) to secure immediate payoffs before potential depletion.
   - **Historical Defection Response:** If more than half of the players defected in the previous round, defect (D) to avoid being exploited by others' greedy behavior.
   - **Cooperate (C):** If both conditions are not met, continue cooperating to sustain the stock for future rounds.

3. **Last Round (r):** Always Defect (D)
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff since there are no subsequent rounds to be affected by stock depletion.

### Edge Cases Handling:

- **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize defecting if the stock is below the threshold to ensure current payoffs, as future rounds may be severely impacted.
- **Majority Defection:** React to widespread defection by switching strategies to avoid being exploited, ensuring competitive payoffs.

### Exploitative Mindset Integration:

The strategy aligns with an exploitative approach by:
- Cooperating initially to maintain a sustainable resource.
- Adapting to opponents' actions and stock levels to prevent exploitation.
- Maximizing payoffs in the final round without concern for future depletion.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
def decide_action(game_state, history):
    current_round = game_state['round']
    total_rounds = game_state['r']
    current_stock = game_state['stock']
    capacity = game_state['capacity']
    n = game_state['n']

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return 'D'
    
    else:
        # Calculate stock threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity)
        threshold = capacity / 2
        
        # Determine number of defectors in previous round
        prev_actions = history['actions'][-1]
        defectors = sum(1 for action in prev_actions if action == 'D')
        
        # Check conditions for defecting
        if current_stock < threshold or defectors > n / 2:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

### Explanation:

This strategy starts cooperatively to maintain a healthy stock level, then adaptively switches based on the stock's health and opponents' behavior. By defecting when the stock is low or when most players have defected previously, it prevents being exploited while ensuring competitive payoffs. The final round always defects to maximize immediate gains, reflecting a strategic balance between cooperation and exploitation.

**Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation with Stock Sustainability (ARCSS)**

1. **Initial Round (Round 1):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
     - *Rationale:* Encourage a cooperative environment from the start, maximizing initial stock sustainability.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Rounds 2 to r):*
   - **Decision Making:**
     - **Stock Threshold Check:** If current stock is below a threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), Cooperate to help replenish it.
       - *Adjustment:* The threshold can be tuned but starts at 20%.
     - **Reciprocal Cooperation Rate:** Calculate the average cooperation rate of all players in the previous round. If >= 50%, Cooperate; else, Defect.
       - *Measurement:* Cooperation rate is the number of players who chose C divided by n.
     - **Stock Level Consideration:** If stock is near capacity (e.g., above 80%), defect to maximize immediate gain without significant risk to future sustainability.

3. **Last Round (Round r):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate if the stock is sufficient to sustain growth, otherwise Defect to secure remaining resources.
     - *Consideration:* Avoid depletion while ensuring not to miss out on final payoffs.

4. **Adaptive Elements:**
   - Continuously monitor the stock level and others' cooperation rates.
   - Adjust the strategy dynamically based on observed behavior and stock trends to balance exploitation and sustainability.

5. **Robustness Measures:**
   - Handles various player behaviors by reciprocating their actions, discouraging exploitation.
   - Protects against stock depletion by prioritizing cooperation when necessary for future rounds.

This strategy aims to exploit cooperative tendencies while safeguarding against excessive depletion, ensuring a balanced approach between immediate gain and long-term sustainability.

**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**Objective:** Maximize total payoff through an adaptive strategy that responds to both stock levels and opponents' past behavior.

**Decision Rules:**

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Stock Threshold Check:** If the current stock level is below `capacity/(2n)`, Defect (D).

def decide_action(round_number, current_stock, previous_actions):
    n = number_of_players
    capacity = max_stock_level

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    stock_threshold = capacity / (2 * n)
    defection_rate = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D') / n
    
    if current_stock < stock_threshold or defection_rate > 0.5:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'C'

def play_game(total_rounds):
    actions = []
    for round in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            previous_stock = get_previous_stock()
            previous_actions = get_previous_actions()
            action = decide_action(round, previous_stock, previous_actions)
        
        actions.append(action)
    return actions
```

**Explanation:**

- The strategy begins with cooperation to encourage initial stock sustainability.
- It adapts based on the stock level and opponents' past behavior, balancing between exploiting current conditions and maintaining resource health.
- By defecting when necessary, it avoids being exploited while aiming to maximize long-term payoffs through strategic cooperation.

**Exploitative Strategy: Adaptive Cooperation and Defection**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Last Round (t = r):** Always choose to Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.
   - **Other Rounds (t < r):**
     - Calculate the remaining rounds after the current round: `remaining = r - t`
     - Determine the dynamic threshold: `threshold_t = capacity * (remaining / r)`
     - If the current stock level is above `threshold_t`, Cooperate (C). This helps maintain a sustainable stock for future rounds.
     - If the current stock level is below or equal to `threshold_t`, Defect (D) to secure higher payoffs now, as the stock may deplete quickly otherwise.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Use the threshold calculation as there's no prior history. This encourages initial cooperation if the stock is sufficient.
   - **Low Stock Situations:** If the stock is critically low, defecting ensures you get a share before depletion.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - The strategy dynamically adjusts based on remaining rounds and current stock, aiming to balance future sustainability with immediate gains without relying on others' cooperation.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```
function decide_action(t, r, stock, capacity):
    if t == r:
        return "D"
    else:
        remaining = r - t
        threshold = capacity * (remaining / r)
        if stock > threshold:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

This strategy adaptively switches between cooperation and defection, ensuring robust performance across varying opponent behaviors and game states.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_482 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a dynamic approach that balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observed behavior and stock levels. The strategy adapts to others' actions while considering the game's state and history.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Cooperation and Stock Levels

1. **Initial Rounds**: 
   - Start by Cooperating (C) in the first round to establish a baseline of cooperation and observe other players' initial moves without depleting the stock excessively.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation**:
   - After each round, analyze the payoffs of all players to determine how many chose to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D). This is done by comparing individual payoffs against the known rewards for each action (S/(2n) for C and S/n for D).
   - Track the number of defectors over recent rounds, say the last three rounds, using a moving average to assess the trend in others' behavior.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - **Cooperate** if the majority of players recently cooperated and the stock level is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity). This helps maintain a sustainable resource for future gains.
   - **Defect** if the proportion of defectors in recent rounds exceeds a threshold (e.g., more than 50%) or if the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 30% of capacity), indicating that cooperation is insufficient to sustain the resource.

4. **Endgame Strategy**:
   - In the last two rounds, switch to Defecting (D) to maximize immediate gains since there are limited future benefits from cooperation as the game concludes.

### Rationale

- **Initial Cooperation**: Sets a cooperative tone and allows observation of others' strategies without immediate depletion.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: By reacting to recent actions, the strategy discourages exploitation while maintaining flexibility.
- **Stock Level Consideration**: Prevents over-depletion by triggering defection when the stock is critically low, ensuring maximum extraction before exhaustion.
- **Endgame Exploitation**: Captures remaining value in the final rounds where future sustainability is no longer a concern.

This approach ensures that the strategy remains responsive to both the game's state and others' actions, optimizing for both immediate gains and long-term resource availability.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_483 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, I propose a dynamic approach that adapts based on observed behavior and current state. This strategy balances the need to exploit others' cooperation with preserving the resource for future rounds.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation Strategy (AES)

1. **Initialization:**
   - Begin by Cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative baseline.
   - Track historical actions of other players, specifically the number of defectors each round.
   - Monitor the stock level after each round to assess resource health.

2. **Decision Making Process Each Round:**
   - **Cooperation Threshold:** If the average number of defectors in recent rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds) is below a threshold (e.g., 30%), Cooperate to maintain the stock.
   - **Defection Trigger:** If the average exceeds this threshold, switch to Defecting to exploit others' cooperation without over-depleting the stock.
   - **Stock Level Check:** If the current stock falls below a critical level (e.g., capacity/2), prioritize Cooperation to allow regrowth, regardless of others' actions.

3. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last round, always Defect to maximize immediate payoff since future stock preservation is no longer a concern.

4. **Adaptive Adjustments:**
   - Continuously update the average defection rate and stock levels.
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically based on observed trends to maintain flexibility.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
Initialize:
    actions_history = []
    stock_history = [capacity]
    strategy = 'C'

For each round from 1 to r:
    if round == 1 or len(actions_history) < threshold:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        recent_defectors = average number of defectors in last few rounds
        current_stock = stock_history[-1]

        if recent_defectors > 0.3 or current_stock < capacity / 2:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'

    if round == r:
        action = 'D'

    actions_history.append(action)
    # Update stock based on all players' actions
    update_stock()
    stock_history.append(new_stock)

    record payoff

return total_payoff
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with cooperation encourages others to reciprocate and builds a stable resource base.
- **Monitoring and Adaptation:** By tracking defectors and stock levels, the strategy adjusts to prevent overexploitation and maintain resource sustainability.
- **Endgame Defection:** Maximizing payoff in the final round ensures no opportunity is wasted without future consequences.

This strategy effectively balances cooperation and defection, adapting dynamically to game conditions while exploiting others' behaviors for optimal payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_484 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource game, we've developed a comprehensive approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's the structured strategy:

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and History

1. **Last Round Strategy**: In the final round, always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future stock levels.

2. **Stock Threshold Check**: Calculate a threshold based on the capacity. If the current stock falls below this threshold, switch to Defecting to secure higher payoffs before potential depletion.

3. **Historical Defection Rate Analysis**: Monitor the number of players who defected in previous rounds. If the rate exceeds a specified threshold, adopt Defection to exploit others' greed and protect your share.

4. **Default Cooperation**: When neither the stock nor historical defection triggers apply, Cooperate (C) to sustain resource levels for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def strategy(stock, capacity, round, r, history):
    if round == r:
        return "D"
    
    threshold = 0.5 * capacity  # Adjust based on testing
    
    if stock < threshold:
        return "D"
    
    # Calculate historical defection rate
    total_defections = sum([defect_count for defect_count in history])
    average_defection_rate = total_defections / (len(history) * len(players))
    
    if average_defection_rate > 0.5:  # Threshold can be adjusted
        return "D"
    
    return "C"
```

### Explanation

- **Last Round Maximization**: By defecting in the last round, the strategy ensures maximum payoff when future consequences are irrelevant.
  
- **Stock-Based Adaptation**: Using a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) allows the strategy to respond to resource depletion, preventing over-exploitation.

- **History-Driven Decision Making**: Analyzing past defections helps predict others' behavior. Exceeding a defection rate threshold triggers a shift towards defecting, exploiting opponents' greed while safeguarding against being exploited.

This approach balances cooperation and exploitation, ensuring sustainability while maximizing payoffs in a competitive environment.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_485 = '''
To design an effective exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need a balanced approach that adapts to both the current state of the stock and the actions of other players. The goal is to maximize individual payoffs while ensuring the sustainability of the resource over multiple rounds.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation with Conservation (AEC)

1. **Initial Rounds**: Cooperate for the first few rounds to observe others' behavior and establish a baseline stock level.
2. **Monitor Stock Levels**: Track the current stock level relative to capacity, using key thresholds to guide decision-making:
   - Above 75% of capacity: Consider defecting if many players are defecting.
   - Between 50-75%: Balance actions based on recent trends in others' behavior.
   - Below 50%: Prioritize cooperation to conserve the stock.
3. **Track Others' Actions**: Calculate a weighted moving average of other players' defection rates, giving more weight to recent rounds.
4. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Adjust your strategy dynamically based on stock levels and others' actions:
   - High stock with high defection: Defect to exploit.
   - Low stock: Cooperate to conserve.
5. **Endgame Consideration**: In the last round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Outline

```python
Initialize:
    history = list to track each player's past actions (C or D)
    defection_rate = 0.5  # Initial guess of defection rate
    stock_threshold_high = 0.75 * capacity
    stock_threshold_low = 0.5 * capacity
    decay_factor = 0.9  # Weight for recent rounds

For each round from 1 to r:
    if it's the first round or not enough history:
        action = Cooperate (C)
    else:
        calculate current_stock_level
        update_defection_rate()
        
        if current_round == r:  # Last round
            action = Defect (D)
        elif current_stock > stock_threshold_high:
            if defection_rate > 0.5:
                action = Defect (D)
            else:
                action = Cooperate (C)
        elif current_stock between stock_threshold_low and stock_threshold_high:
            if recent_defection_trend is increasing:
                action = Defect (D)
            else:
                action = Cooperate (C)
        else:  # current_stock < stock_threshold_low
            action = Cooperate (C)
    
    observe others' actions and update history
    update defection_rate using decay_factor

Update defection_rate function:
    new_defection_rate = decay_factor * defection_rate + (1 - decay_factor) * current_defections / n
```

### Strategy Explanation

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation allows gathering initial data on others' tendencies and maintaining a healthy stock.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: By adjusting based on recent actions and stock levels, the strategy remains responsive to changing dynamics without being exploitable by defectors.
- **Threshold-Based Decisions**: Clear thresholds guide when to exploit or conserve, ensuring balanced decision-making.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Maximizing payoff in the last round ensures no missed opportunities.

This strategy aims to balance exploitation with conservation, adapting dynamically to maintain high payoffs while preserving the resource for future rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_486 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that is adaptive and robust, we'll use a combination of reciprocity and stock conservation. The strategy is based on observing others' past actions and adjusting behavior to maximize payoffs while preserving the resource.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round**: Always Cooperate (C) to encourage initial cooperation.
2. **Middle Rounds**:
   - If the current stock level is below half of the capacity, Cooperate (C) to help replenish the stock.
   - Otherwise, observe the number of players who defected in the previous round. If more than half defected, Defect (D); else, Cooperate (C).
3. **Last Round**:
   - If the current stock level is above half of the capacity, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.
   - Otherwise, Cooperate (C) to avoid depleting the stock excessively.

### Decision Rules:

- **Round 1**: Choose C.
- **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
  - If S < capacity/2: Choose C.
  - Else, if previous round's defectors > n/2: Choose D.
  - Else: Choose C.
- **Last Round (r)**:
  - If S > capacity/2: Choose D.
  - Else: Choose C.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1

    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        # Determine action for middle and last rounds
        previous_actions = history[-1]
        previous_defectors = sum(1 for action in previous_actions if action == 'D')
        
        if current_round < r:
            if stock < capacity / 2:
                return "C"
            else:
                if previous_defectors > n / 2:
                    return "D"
                else:
                    return "C"
        else: # Last round
            if stock > capacity / 2:
                return "D"
            else:
                return "C"
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starting with cooperation sets a cooperative tone and encourages others to reciprocate.
- **Stock Conservation**: When the stock is low, cooperation helps replenish it for future rounds, ensuring sustained payoffs.
- **Reciprocity**: By defecting when most others defected previously, we punish non-cooperative behavior, encouraging others to cooperate.
- **Last Round Strategy**: Maximizing immediate payoff if the stock is sufficient, while avoiding depletion if it's low.

This strategy balances exploitation with sustainability, adapting to both opponent actions and resource levels.

**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation:**
   - In the first round, always Cooperate (C). This initiates the game with maximum resource conservation, promoting a sustainable start.

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - For each subsequent round, evaluate the previous round's outcomes:
     - Calculate the stock change and estimate the number of Defectors based on total consumption.
     - If the stock dropped significantly (e.g., below a set threshold like half capacity) or if many players defected, switch to Defect (D).
     - Otherwise, continue Cooperating.

3. **Stock Threshold Monitoring:**
   - Implement a stock threshold, such as 50% of capacity. If the stock falls below this, prioritize Defecting to maximize immediate payoff while protecting against further depletion.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - As the game approaches its final rounds (e.g., last 20%), gradually increase the tendency to Defect. This leverages the endgame scenario where future punishments are less relevant, allowing for maximizing current payoffs.

This strategy balances cooperation and exploitation by adapting to both the stock's health and opponents' actions, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios.

To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we have developed a comprehensive approach that balances cooperation and defection based on historical behavior and current stock levels. Here is the structured strategy:

### Strategy Name: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability (AES)

#### Core Principles:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating to encourage trust and resource sustainability.
2. **Adaptive Response**: Adjust actions based on the historical cooperation rate of other players.
3. **Stock Level Consideration**: Monitor the stock level to avoid depletion while maximizing payoffs.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Modify behavior in critical rounds such as the first and last rounds.

#### Decision Rules:

1. **First Round**:
   - Cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and build trust, encouraging others to do the same.

2. **Intermediate Rounds**:
   - Calculate the average defection rate of other players over the past few rounds.
     - If the defection rate is above 50%, switch to Defect (D).
     - If the stock level is below a threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), defect to secure higher payoffs before potential depletion.

3. **Last Round**:
   - Always Defect (D) as there are no future consequences, maximizing immediate payoff.

4. **Stock Sustainability Check**:
   - After each round, assess the stock level.
     - If it's critically low, switch to cooperation in subsequent rounds if others demonstrate higher cooperation rates.

5. **Punishment Mechanism**:
   - Implement a brief period of defection (e.g., one round) following significant defections by others to deter future exploitation.

#### Pseudocode Outline:

```python
def aes_strategy(game_state, history):
    current_round = game_state['round']
    total_rounds = game_state['total_rounds']
    stock_level = game_state['stock']
    capacity = game_state['capacity']
    
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate average defection rate in past rounds
    defections = sum(1 for action in history['actions'] if action == 'D')
    avg_defection_rate = defections / (current_round - 1)
    
    if stock_level < capacity * 0.25:
        return 'D'
    
    if avg_defection_rate > 0.5:
        return 'D'
    
    # Check for sustainability and punish past defectors briefly
    if current_round > 2 and history['actions'][-2] == 'D':
        return 'D'
    
    return 'C'

# Usage example:
action = aes_strategy(game_state, history)
```

#### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: The strategy starts with cooperation to foster a cooperative environment.
- **Adaptive Response**: By tracking historical defections, the strategy adapts by defecting when others are consistently non-cooperative.
- **Stock Level Management**: The strategy ensures that if the stock is critically low, it defects to secure immediate gains while considering future sustainability.
- **Edge Cases**: Special handling for the first and last rounds ensures optimal play without compromising long-term benefits.

This approach is robust against various opponent behaviors, balancing the need to exploit others' actions with maintaining resource sustainability for future payoffs.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_489 = '''
To address the problem of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we have developed a comprehensive approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. This strategy is adaptive, responsive to both the actions of other players and the state of the common pool.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to observe others' initial moves and gauge their behavior without immediately depleting the stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Track Cooperation Rates:** Monitor how often each player has chosen to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in past rounds.
   - **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
     - If the majority of players have Cooperated historically, consider Defecting (D) to exploit their cooperation for higher immediate payoffs.
     - Conversely, if many players have Defected leading to a significant depletion of the stock, switch to Cooperating (C) to allow the stock to recover.

3. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
   - Implement a stock threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity). If the current stock level (S) falls below this threshold, choose to Cooperate (C) to facilitate stock growth and ensure future sustainability.
   - If the stock is above the threshold, Defect (D) to maximize immediate gains while maintaining a healthy stock level.

4. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - In the final round, always choose to Defect (D) to secure the maximum possible payoff, as there are no subsequent rounds to consider.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **First Round:** By Cooperating initially, we gather insights into others' strategies and set a baseline for future decisions.
  
- **Cooperation Rate Tracking:** This involves observing each player's historical actions. A high cooperation rate among others suggests an opportunity to exploit their altruism by Defecting, thereby increasing our immediate payoff.

- **Stock Threshold Mechanism:** This ensures that if the stock is depleted beyond a safe level, we prioritize its recovery by Cooperating, preventing potential future crashes and maintaining long-term playability.

- **Final Round Exploitation:** Recognizing that the last round offers no future consequences, Defecting maximizes immediate gain without adverse effects on subsequent rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def exploitative_strategy(n, r, capacity, history, current_stock):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    
    # Calculate cooperation rate from history
    total_cooperations = sum(1 for action in history['actions'] if action == 'C')
    avg_cooperation_rate = total_cooperations / (n * (current_round - 1))
    
    # Determine stock threshold
    stock_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
    
    if current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if avg_cooperation_rate > 0.5:
            return 'D'
        else:
            return 'C'

def main():
    for round in range(r):
        # Record actions and update history
        # Calculate current stock after all actions
        action = exploitative_strategy(n, r, capacity, history, current_stock)
        history['actions'].append(action)
```

### Conclusion:

This strategy effectively balances exploitation with sustainability by dynamically adjusting based on collective past behavior and the current state of the common pool. It ensures that we maximize our payoffs while maintaining a viable stock for future rounds, making it both robust and adaptive in competitive scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_490 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
- **First Round:** Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of cooperation.
- **Subsequent Rounds:**
  - Calculate the average consumption per player from the previous round.
  - If the average exceeds the cooperative benchmark (stock/(2n)), defect (D) in the next round.
  - Otherwise, continue cooperating (C).
  - Monitor the stock level; if it falls below a critical threshold (e.g., capacity/2), switch to cooperating to facilitate recovery.

**2. Edge Cases Handling:**
- **First Round:** Start with cooperation to encourage initial stock sustainability.
- **Last Few Rounds:** Consider defecting to maximize immediate gains, but weigh against the risk of stock depletion affecting final payoffs.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Prioritize cooperation if the stock is critically low to prevent depletion and ensure future rounds' viability.

**3. Exploitative Approach:**
The strategy adapts based on opponents' past actions and current stock levels, aiming to exploit cooperation while protecting against excessive defection. It balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability by punishing defectors and preserving stock health.

This approach fosters a dynamic balance between cooperation and exploitation, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_491 = '''
To address the Common Pool Resource game effectively, we can implement a adaptive and exploitative strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on observed behavior and stock dynamics. Here's the structured approach:

### Strategy: Adaptive Threshold Cooperation with Stock Sensitivity

1. **Initial Rounds (First Round):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate.
   - **Rationale:** Encourage initial cooperation to build a cooperative environment and observe others' responses.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Observation:** Track the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
   - **Threshold Calculation:** Determine the threshold for cooperation as (n-1)/2. Adjust this dynamically based on the current stock level:
     - If stock is below 50% of capacity, increase the threshold by requiring more cooperators before choosing to cooperate.
     - If stock is above 50%, maintain or slightly decrease the threshold.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - Cooperate if the number of previous round's cooperators meets or exceeds the adjusted threshold.
   - Defect otherwise, especially if recent defections have significantly depleted the stock.

4. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - If stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 20% of capacity), switch to cooperation for a set number of rounds to allow regeneration, provided others show signs of cooperation.
   - Monitor stock growth after such periods; if regeneration is insufficient, revert to defection.

5. **Final Round Handling:**
   - In the last round, defect to maximize immediate payoff since future consequences are irrelevant.

### Pseudocode Illustration:

```
function decide_action(previous_actions, stock_level, round, capacity):
    if round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"
    
    previous_coop_count = count of Cooperate in previous_actions
    threshold = (n - 1) / 2
    
    # Adjust threshold based on stock level
    if stock_level < 0.5 * capacity:
        adjusted_threshold = threshold + 1
    else:
        adjusted_threshold = threshold
    
    if previous_coop_count >= adjusted_threshold and round != r:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"

# Example usage
n = number_of_players
current_stock = current_stock_level
round_number = current_round
strategy = decide_action(previous_actions, current_stock, round_number, capacity)
```

### Rationale:

- **Initial Cooperation:** Encourages others to reciprocate and builds a foundation for sustainable stock management.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Adapts strategy based on stock health, promoting cooperation when necessary to prevent depletion and switching to defection when exploitation is beneficial.
- **Stock Sensitivity:** Ensures that the strategy responds to the resource's state, preserving it for future rounds while allowing strategic exploitation when advantageous.

This approach aims to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to maintain a healthy stock level and exploit opponents' behaviors effectively.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_492 = '''
**Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation (First Few Rounds):**
   - Cooperate in the initial rounds to establish a baseline and observe other players' behaviors.

2. **Monitor Contributions:**
   - Track each player's actions across rounds, noting whether they cooperate or defect.
   - Calculate the average contribution per round relative to the cooperative threshold (stock/(2n)).

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - If the majority of players are cooperating (e.g., above 70% cooperative contributions), continue cooperating.
   - If a significant number of players defect, reducing the stock unsustainably, switch to defecting but avoid over-depletion by not exceeding a certain limit.

4. **Stock Conservation:**
   - Monitor the stock level. If it falls below a critical threshold, revert to cooperation temporarily to allow regeneration, ensuring long-term gains.

5. **Last Round Strategy:**
   - In the final round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```
Initialize:
    count_coop = 0
    count_defect = 0

For each round from 1 to r:
    if current_round <= initial_coop_rounds or stock < critical_threshold:
        action = C
    else:
        avg_contribution = total_consumption / n
        if avg_contribution > cooperative_threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D

    record others' actions
    update count_coop and count_defect based on observed actions

    if current_round == r:
        action = D  # Always defect in the last round

Execute action and update stock accordingly.
```

This strategy balances exploiting others' cooperation while maintaining the resource's sustainability, adapting dynamically to other players' behaviors.

**Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game**

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **Cooperation Threshold (CT):** If the average cooperation rate of other players in past rounds exceeds 50%, cooperate if the current stock is above a sustainability threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity). Otherwise, defect.
   - **Stock Sustainability Check:** If the stock falls below a critical level (e.g., 50% of capacity), switch to cooperation to allow regeneration.

**2. Punishment Mechanism:**
   - Implement a "Tit-for-Tat" approach. If recent rounds show high defection leading to significant stock depletion, defect for a set number of subsequent rounds to reduce exploiters' gains and encourage cooperation.

**3. Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a baseline of cooperation.
   - **Last Round:** Defect if the current stock is sufficient to handle the impact without causing irreversible depletion.

**4. Adaptive Adjustments:**
   - Continuously monitor and adjust the strategy based on the evolution of other players' behaviors and the stock's condition, using a weighted average of past actions to inform future decisions.

This approach balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability, adapting dynamically to maintain resource health while exploiting opportunities when safe.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_494 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed a balanced approach that adapts to both the game's state and opponents' historical actions. This strategy ensures sustainability while maximizing payoffs by taking advantage of surplus when others are exploiting.

### Strategy Overview:

1. **First Round**: Cooperate (C) to initiate with minimal consumption and observe others' behavior.
2. **Middle Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1)**:
   - Calculate the moving average of defection rates over the past three rounds.
   - Based on current stock level:
     - If stock is below 30% of capacity, cooperate to aid recovery.
     - If stock exceeds 70%, defect to exploit surplus.
     - For stock between 30-70%, defect if the recent defection rate is 50% or higher; otherwise, cooperate.
3. **Last Round**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, history, current_round):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    
    # Calculate moving average of defection rates over last 3 rounds (or all available if fewer)
    recent_defections = [round_info['defection_rate'] for round_info in history[-3:]]
    avg_defection = sum(recent_defections) / len(recent_defections)
    
    stock_ratio = current_stock / capacity
    
    if current_round == r:
        return "D"
    elif stock_ratio < 0.3:
        return "C"
    elif stock_ratio > 0.7:
        return "D"
    else:
        if avg_defection >= 0.5:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Cooperation**: Starts with cooperation to establish a baseline and encourage others to do the same.
- **Adaptive Response**: Uses recent history to decide actions, ensuring the strategy isn't overly reactive but still responsive to changes in opponents' behavior.
- **Stock Management**: Protects against resource depletion by cooperating when stock is low and exploits surplus when it's high.
- **Final Round Exploitation**: Maximizes immediate gain in the last round, as future consequences are irrelevant.

This approach balances sustainability with exploitation, making it robust against a variety of opponent strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_495 = '''
To address the problem of deciding whether to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in each round of the game, we can outline a strategy that balances maintaining a healthy stock level with exploiting opportunities when others defect. The approach is structured as follows:

1. **First Round:** Cooperate to establish a high initial stock level.
2. **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
   - Observe the number of players who defected in the previous round (Defec_prev).
   - If more than 30% of the players defected, defect this round.
   - Otherwise, check if the stock after the previous round's consumption was below 50% of capacity. If so, defect; otherwise, cooperate.
3. **Last Round (t = r):** Always Defect to maximize immediate payoff without concern for future rounds.

This strategy ensures cooperation when beneficial and switches to defection when necessary, balancing long-term sustainability with strategic exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_496 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an effective strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, I present a structured approach that balances exploitation and sustainability. This strategy, named "Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability" (AES), is designed to maximize payoffs while preserving the resource for future rounds.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability (AES)

#### 1. Decision Rules:

- **Initial Rounds**: In the first two rounds, Cooperate (C) to establish a baseline of behavior and observe others' actions without immediate exploitation.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - Calculate the proportion of players who Defected in the last three rounds (`proportion_defect`).
  - Determine the current stock level relative to capacity.

  If either `proportion_defect` exceeds 50% or the stock falls below 30% of capacity, choose Cooperate (C). Otherwise, choose Defect (D).

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

- **Last Round**: In the final round, always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff, as future stock preservation is no longer a concern.

- **Low Stock Levels**: If the stock drops below 20% of capacity at any point, switch to Cooperate (C) for the next three rounds to allow regeneration, regardless of others' actions.

#### 3. Exploitative Approach:

- AES exploits others' cooperative tendencies by Defecting when it's safe, i.e., when the stock is healthy and few players are Defecting.
- It avoids being exploited by switching to Cooperate when necessary, preventing significant stock depletion.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def aes_strategy(current_round, total_rounds, proportion_defect_recent, stock_level, capacity):
    if current_round <= 2:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == total_rounds:
        return "D"
    
    low_stock_threshold = 0.3 * capacity
    defect_threshold = 0.5
    
    if (proportion_defect_recent > defect_threshold) or (stock_level < low_stock_threshold):
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

def check_low_stock(stock_level, capacity, last_three_actions):
    if stock_level < 0.2 * capacity:
        # Cooperate for next three rounds
        return ["C", "C", "C"]
    return None
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Rounds**: AES starts with cooperation to observe others' behavior and preserve the stock.
- **Adaptive Decision Making**: By evaluating recent defection rates and current stock levels, AES dynamically adjusts its actions to balance exploitation and sustainability.
- **Endgame Strategy**: In the last round, AES defects to maximize immediate gain, as future rounds are not a concern.
- **Stock Preservation**: If the stock is critically low, AES prioritizes regeneration by cooperating for a set period.

This strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors, ensuring long-term payoffs through adaptive and exploitative decision-making.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_497 = '''
To solve this problem, we need to determine an optimal strategy for deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round of a game, given that there are `r` rounds and the resource (stock) has a maximum capacity. The goal is to maximize the total payoff by balancing immediate gains with preserving the stock for future rounds.

### Approach
The approach involves using a dynamic threshold based on the remaining number of rounds. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Decision Rule:**
   - For each round `t` from 1 to `r`:
     - Calculate the number of remaining rounds, `rem = r - t`.
     - If it is the last round (`t == r`), always defect to maximize immediate gain.
     - Otherwise, compute a threshold `T(t) = capacity * (rem / r)`. This threshold decreases linearly as the game progresses:
       - In early rounds, the threshold is high, encouraging cooperation unless the stock is very high.
       - As the game nears its end, the threshold lowers, making it easier to defect.
     - If the current stock `S` is greater than `T(t)`, defect. Otherwise, cooperate.

This strategy ensures that we exploit the resource when it is plentiful while conserving it when necessary, especially in earlier rounds, and gradually shift towards exploitation as the game progresses.

### Solution Code
```python
def decide_action(current_stock, capacity, current_round, total_rounds):
    """
    Decide whether to Cooperate or Defect based on dynamic threshold.
    
    Parameters:
    - current_stock (float): The current stock level.
    - capacity (float): Maximum possible stock.
    - current_round (int): Current round number t (1-indexed).
    - total_rounds (int): Total number of rounds r.
    
    Returns:
    - str: "Cooperate" or "Defect"
    """
    if current_round == total_rounds:
        return "Defect"
    rem = total_rounds - current_round
    threshold = capacity * (rem / total_rounds)
    if current_stock > threshold:
        return "Defect"
    else:
        return "Cooperate"
```

### Explanation
The solution dynamically adjusts the decision-making process based on the remaining rounds and the current stock level. By calculating a threshold that decreases as the game progresses, it ensures that we balance immediate gains with future payoffs effectively. This approach is both simple and robust, allowing for adaptation to different game lengths and resource capacities while maintaining optimal play.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_498 = '''
To address the challenge of optimizing decisions in a dynamic environment where each choice affects future outcomes and others' actions influence results, the following strategy is recommended:

**Strategy: "Sustainable Cooperator with Stock Threshold"**

1. **Initial Action**: In the first round, always cooperate to start with the highest possible stock level.

2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - After each round, observe the stock level after consumption and growth.
   - If the stock level falls below 50% of the capacity, switch to defecting in the next round to secure higher immediate payoffs.
   - If the stock level remains above or equal to 50% of the capacity, continue cooperating to maintain sustainable use.

**Rationale**: This approach encourages cooperation when the resource is plentiful but switches to self-protection by defecting when the resource becomes scarce. It balances maintaining the resource for future rounds with securing immediate benefits when sustainability is at risk.

**Answer**: The optimal strategy is to cooperate unless the stock drops below half its capacity, in which case you should defect. Thus, your decision rule is:

$\boxed{\text{Cooperate if the previous stock level was above 50% of capacity; otherwise, Defect.}}$
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_499 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Sustainability (AES)**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and encourage others to do the same, potentially leading to higher sustainable payoffs in subsequent rounds.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - Calculate the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
     - If at least half of the players cooperated, choose to Cooperate (C) to maintain or increase the stock level for future exploitation.
     - If fewer than half cooperated, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff while others are defecting, ensuring you aren't the only one preserving the stock without reciprocation.
   - **Last Round:** Always choose Defect (D). Since there's no future impact on the stock beyond this round, prioritize maximizing your immediate payoff.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - **First Round:** Start with cooperation to establish a baseline of trust and encourage others to cooperate.
   - **Last Round:** Switch strategy to defect in the final round to exploit whatever remaining stock is available without concern for future depletion.

3. **Exploitative Approach:**
   - The strategy aligns with an exploitative mindset by adapting based on the majority's previous actions, ensuring that you're not consistently exploited by others' defection while maintaining the stock when cooperation is mutual.
   - By defecting when most others do, it prevents being a sucker who cooperates while others take advantage. Conversely, cooperating when others do helps sustain the resource for future exploitation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function decide_action(history):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        previous_coops = count of players who chose 'C' in last round
        total_players = n
        if previous_coops >= total_players / 2:
            return 'C'
        else:
            if current_round == r:  # Last round
                return 'D'
            else:
                return 'D'

# Example usage for each round
for t from 1 to r:
    if t == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        previous_actions = history[t-2]
        coops_last_round = sum(1 for a in previous_actions if a == 'C')
        if coops_last_round >= n / 2:
            action = 'C'
        else:
            if t == r:
                action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'D'
    take_action(action)
```

This strategy balances the need to exploit current conditions while maintaining a sustainable resource for future rounds, ensuring robust performance against a variety of opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_500 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we've developed a comprehensive approach that balances immediate gains with long-term sustainability. Here's a structured strategy:

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Conservation (AEC)

**1. Decision Rules:**
   - **First Round:** Begin by Defecting (D) to maximize initial payoff and gauge others' reactions.
   - **Subsequent Rounds:** 
     - If the stock level is below 50% of capacity, Cooperate (C) to allow stock regeneration.
     - If the stock is above 50%, defect if the average payoff in recent rounds is below a threshold (e.g., 20% of maximum possible), otherwise cooperate.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **First Round:** Defect to set a tone of exploitation and observe others' strategies.
   - **Last Round:** Always Defect since there’s no future stock to preserve, maximizing immediate gain.
   - **Low Stock Levels:** Switch to Cooperate if the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity) to ensure resource availability in future rounds.

**3. Exploitative Mindset:**
   - Continuously monitor others' actions and adjust strategy accordingly. If others are predominantly Cooperating, increase Defection to exploit their conservation.
   - Use a mix of strategies if others are inconsistent, balancing exploitation with necessary cooperation to maintain stock health.

**4. Adaptive Elements:**
   - Track the frequency of others' cooperation and defection. Adjust your own actions to capitalize on their tendencies.
   - Implement a dynamic threshold for cooperation based on observed behavior, ensuring flexibility in response to changing strategies of others.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def strategy(n, capacity, stock_history, payoff_history):
    current_stock = stock_history[-1]
    
    if len(stock_history) == 0:
        return "D"  # First round
    
    round_num = len(stock_history)
    if round_num >= r:  # Last round
        return "D"
    
    avg_payoff = sum(payoff_history)/len(payoff_history)
    threshold = capacity * 0.5
    
    if current_stock < threshold:
        return "C"
    else:
        recent_defections = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions[-3:] if action == "D")
        if avg_payoff < 0.2 * max_payoff or recent_defections > (n-1)*0.5:
            return "D"
        else:
            return "C"

```

### Explanation:

- **Initial Defection:** Starts with D to maximize initial payoff and test others' strategies.
- **Stock Thresholds:** Cooperates when stock is low to ensure future rounds have sufficient resources, preventing depletion.
- **Adaptive Response:** Adjusts based on recent payoffs and opponents' actions, defecting more if others are exploiting or if personal gains are below expectations.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Ensures maximum gain in the last round by always defecting and conserves when stock is critically low.

This strategy effectively balances exploitation with conservation, ensuring robust performance across various opponent behaviors.

### Strategy Overview: Adaptive Exploitation with Conservation (AEC)

**Objective**: Maximize total payoff by exploiting opponents' actions while conserving the stock for future rounds when necessary.

#### 1. Decision Rules

- **First Round Action**: Cooperate (C) to observe others' initial moves and impact on the stock.
  
- **Subsequent Rounds**:
  - **Calculate Defection Rate**: Determine the average number of defectors from previous rounds.
    - If ≥ 50% of players defected in the last round, defect this round.
  - **Stock Threshold Check**: If current stock is below 25% of capacity, Cooperate to conserve.
  
- **Punishment Mechanism**: If more than half defected in the previous round, Defect in the current round as a punitive measure.

- **Last Round Action**: Always Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff since future rounds don't matter.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases

- **First Round**: Cooperate to gauge others' strategies.
- **Low Stock Scenario**: If stock drops below 25% of capacity, switch to Cooperation until recovery.
- **Rapid Depletion**: Adjust conservation threshold lower if the stock depletes quickly, prompting earlier switches to Cooperation.

### Strategy Explanation

- **Adaptation**: The strategy starts cooperatively to observe and then adapts based on the observed defection rate and stock levels.
- **Punishment**: It punishes frequent defectors by defecting, discouraging exploitation without cooperation.
- **Conservation**: When the stock is low, it prioritizes conservation to ensure future payoffs.
- **Exploitation in Final Round**: Maximizes immediate gain in the last round as future consequences are irrelevant.

This strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors, balancing between exploiting current gains and conserving resources for sustained play.

To address the problem, we designed an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game that adaptively balances between maximizing immediate payoffs and preserving the resource for future rounds. The strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors by responding to both stock levels and other players' actions.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and Opponent Behavior

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:** Cooperate (C). This starts with sustainable consumption, potentially encouraging others to follow suit without assuming cooperation.

2. **Subsequent Rounds:**
   - If the stock after the previous round is below 50% of capacity, choose to Cooperate (C) to aid recovery.
   - Else, if more than half of the players Defected in the previous round, Cooperate this round to prevent over-depletion.
   - Otherwise, Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs while maintaining a healthy stock level.

**Edge Cases:**

- **Last Round:** Always Defect (D) to secure the highest possible payoff since there are no future rounds to consider.
- **Low Stock Levels:** Cooperate if the stock falls below 50% of capacity, regardless of other factors, to facilitate recovery and sustain future payoffs.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history)
    
    if current_round == 0:
        return "C"
    
    last_stock = history[-1]["stock_after"]
    
    # Edge case for last round
    if current_round == r - 1:
        return "D"
    
    # Check stock level
    if last_stock < capacity * 0.5:
        return "C"
    
    # Determine number of defectors in the previous round
    defectors = sum(1 for action in history[-1]["actions"] if action == "D")
    
    if defectors > n / 2:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"
```

### Explanation

- **First Round Cooperation:** Starts with cooperation to set a sustainable tone and encourage others, without depending on their reciprocity.
- **Stock Level Check:** Cooperates when the stock is below half capacity to ensure resource recovery for future exploitation.
- **Defection Threshold:** Switches to cooperation if over half the players defected previously, preventing excessive depletion that could harm future payoffs.
- **Last Round Exploitation:** Maximizes immediate gain in the final round without concern for resource sustainability beyond the current game.

This strategy effectively balances short-term gains with long-term resource management, ensuring robust performance against diverse opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_503 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation with Stock Conservation (AECS)**

1. **Initial Round Action:**
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to observe other players' behavior without provoking immediate defection.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Decision Making:**
   a. **Count Defectors:** Track how many players defected in the previous round.
   b. **Defection Threshold:** If more than half of the players defected, switch to Defect (D) for the next 2-3 rounds as a punitive measure.
   
   c. **Stock Level Monitoring:**
      - **Low Stock (S < 25% of Capacity):** Cooperate to allow stock regrowth.
      - **Moderate Stock (25% ≤ S ≤ 75%):** Defect if others are defecting; otherwise, cooperate.
      - **High Stock (S > 75%):** Cooperate to maintain sustainability and encourage growth.

3. **Punishment and Adaptation:**
   - After a punitive phase of 2-3 rounds of defection, evaluate opponents' actions.
     - If opponents return to cooperation, switch back to cooperating.
     - If opponents continue defecting, persist in defecting but monitor stock levels to avoid depletion.

4. **Endgame Strategy (Last 10% of Rounds):**
   - If the stock is above 50% capacity, defect to maximize immediate payoffs.
   - If the stock is below 50%, cooperate to ensure some payoff without depleting the stock entirely.

**Rationale:**
This strategy balances exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs with maintaining stock sustainability. It punishes excessive defection to deter others while adapting based on stock levels and opponents' behavior, ensuring robustness across various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_504 = '''
To address the challenge of designing an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we can structure our approach around adaptive decision-making based on stock levels and opponents' past actions. Here's how the strategy is formulated:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Initial Cooperation**: Start by cooperating in the first round to encourage a high initial stock level and promote cooperation among players.

2. **Adaptive Thresholds**:
   - **Stock Threshold (s_threshold)**: Set at 50% of the capacity. If the current stock falls below this, switch to defecting to secure immediate payoffs.
   - **Cooperation Rate (c_rate)**: Calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round. If less than 50% cooperated, shift towards defecting.

3. **Dynamic Decision-Making**:
   - In each subsequent round, evaluate both the stock level and the cooperation rate from the last round.
   - Cooperate if both conditions (stock above s_threshold and c_rate above 50%) are met; otherwise, defect.

4. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final round, always defect to maximize immediate payoff since there's no future stock to protect.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **First Round Action**: Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and maintain a high initial stock.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**:
   - Calculate the current stock level relative to capacity.
   - Assess the cooperation rate from the previous round.
   - If the stock is below 50% or fewer than half the players cooperated last round, defect; otherwise, continue cooperating.
3. **Last Round Action**: Defect to maximize payoff without concern for future stock levels.

### Rationale:
- **Initial Cooperation** fosters a collaborative environment, potentially leading to higher sustained stocks.
- **Stock Threshold** ensures that if resources are scarce, the strategy prioritizes immediate gains over cooperation.
- **Cooperation Rate** adapts to others' behaviors, discouraging exploitation by switching to defection when others defect excessively.
- **Endgame Defection** maximizes final-round payoff without compromising future rounds.

This strategy balances cooperation and self-interest, adapting dynamically to both environmental conditions (stock levels) and social dynamics (others' actions), ensuring robust performance against diverse opponent strategies.

The strategy should adapt based on observed behavior and the current state of the stock to maximize individual payoff while ensuring long-term resource availability.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation Based on Stock and Behavior

1. **First Round Action**:
   - Cooperate (C). This initial cooperation helps establish a high stock level for future rounds, encouraging sustainability from the beginning.

2. **Rounds 2 to r-1**:
   - **Monitor Previous Actions**: Observe how many players defected in the previous round.
   - **Stock Threshold Check**: Assess if the current stock is above 75% of capacity.
   - **Decision Making**:
     - If less than half of the players defected last round AND the stock is above 75%, cooperate (C).
     - Otherwise, defect (D) to exploit the situation or prevent over-depletion.

3. **Last Round Action**:
   - Always Defect (D). In the final round, prioritize immediate gain since there are no future rounds to consider.

This strategy combines cooperation to maintain a healthy stock with selective defection when necessary. It reacts to both the stock's health and other players' actions, ensuring robustness against various behaviors while maximizing individual payoffs.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_507 = '''
To address this problem, I've developed a strategy called "Adaptive Cooperate-to-Defect" (ACD), designed to be exploitative and adaptive in the Common Pool Resource game. The strategy balances cooperation with strategic defection based on observed stock dynamics.

### Strategy: Adaptive Cooperate-to-Defect (ACD)

#### 1. Decision Rules:
- **Initial Rounds:** Start by Cooperating for the first few rounds to establish a baseline of the stock's behavior.
- **Stock Monitoring:** After initial rounds, monitor the stock level and its trend over time.
- **Cooperate Threshold:** If the stock remains above a certain threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity) and shows signs of stability or growth, continue Cooperating.
- **Defect Trigger:** If the stock drops below the threshold and shows a declining trend, switch to Defecting. This is based on the observation that sustained declines indicate others are defecting, necessitating strategic defection to maximize payoffs.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:
- **First Round:** Always Cooperate to gauge initial conditions.
- **Last Round:** In the final round, always Defect since there's no future gain from cooperation after the game ends.
- **Low Stock Levels:** If the stock is very low (e.g., below a critical threshold like 25% of capacity), defect immediately as the resource may deplete further rounds.

#### 3. Exploitative Approach:
The strategy aligns with an exploitative mindset by capitalizing on cooperation when beneficial and switching to defection when others' actions threaten resource sustainability. It doesn't rely on others' cooperation but adapts based on observed stock dynamics, making it robust against various opponent behaviors.

### Pseudocode Implementation:

```python
def adaptive_cooperate_to_defect(n, capacity, r):
    history_stock = []
    for round in 1 to r:
        if round == 1 or len(history_stock) < 3:  # Initial rounds
            action = 'C'
        else:
            avg_stock = average of last 3 stock levels
            if round == r:  # Last round
                action = 'D'
            elif avg_stock > 0.75 * capacity:
                # Estimate number of cooperators based on previous consumption
                estimated_k = estimate_cooperators(history_stock)
                cooperation_rate = estimated_k / n
                if cooperation_rate > 0.5:
                    action = 'C'
                else:
                    action = 'D'
            else:
                action = 'D'
        # Play the action and observe new stock level
        history_stock.append(new_stock_level)
    return total_payoff

def estimate_cooperators(history_stock):
    # Calculate average consumption and derive estimated number of cooperators
    pass  # Implementation details omitted for brevity
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Rounds:** Cooperate to gather initial data on stock behavior without immediate exploitation.
- **Stock Monitoring:** By tracking the moving average, the strategy adapts to trends indicating whether cooperation is sustainable or if defection is warranted.
- **Defect Trigger:** The decision to defect is based on observed declines in stock levels, preventing over-exploitation by others and maximizing personal payoffs.
- **Edge Cases:** Special handling ensures optimal decisions at critical points like the first and last rounds, and when the stock is critically low.

This strategy effectively balances between maintaining resource sustainability through cooperation and strategically defecting to maximize individual gains when others' actions threaten resource depletion.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_508 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Round Strategy:**
   - In the first round, Cooperate (C) to observe others' behavior and initial stock dynamics.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Strategy:**
   - Track the number of players who Defected in previous rounds.
   - Calculate the average defection rate.
     - If the average defection rate is 50% or higher, switch to primarily Defecting (D) to exploit others' non-cooperative behavior.
     - If the average defection rate is below 50%, continue Cooperating but monitor stock levels.

3. **Stock Level Consideration:**
   - Continuously monitor the current stock level after each round.
     - If the stock falls below a threshold (e.g., half of capacity), switch to Cooperate temporarily to allow stock recovery, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - In the last two rounds of the game, always choose Defect (D) to maximize immediate payoffs without concern for future sustainability.

5. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   - Adjust your strategy based on observed behavior and stock trends. If others start Cooperating more after a period of high defection, reassess and consider switching back if beneficial.

This strategy balances exploiting others' actions with maintaining resource viability, ensuring long-term payoffs through adaptive decision-making.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_509 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Cooperation**: Cooperate in the first round to establish a high stock level and encourage others to cooperate.

2. **Monitor Cooperation Rate**: Track the number of cooperators each round. If more than 50% cooperate, continue cooperating. If fewer than 50%, switch to defecting.

3. **Stock Level Thresholds**: Defect if the stock falls below 70% of capacity, indicating potential depletion and the need for immediate gain.

4. **Adaptive Punishment**: If others defect, defect for two rounds to punish their behavior, then revert to cooperation if others resume cooperating.

5. **Endgame Strategy**: In the last round or when stock is critically low (below 30% of capacity), prioritize defecting to maximize final payoff.

This strategy balances cooperation and exploitation, adapting based on game state and opponents' actions to optimize payoffs while maintaining stock sustainability where possible.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_510 = '''
To design an exploitative strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game, we need to create a robust and adaptive approach that maximizes your total payoff over all rounds. This strategy must be responsive to both the current state of the stock and the behavior of other players. Below is a detailed specification of such a strategy:

### 1. Decision Rules

Your decision in each round (whether to Cooperate or Defect) will depend on three key factors:
- The **current stock level**.
- The **history of cooperation** among all players.
- The **round number** (to handle edge cases like the first and last rounds).

#### a. First Round
- Always Cooperate in the first round to start with a high stock level and encourage others to cooperate.

#### b. Subsequent Rounds
For each subsequent round, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Cooperation Rate**: Compute the average cooperation rate of all players (including yourself) over all previous rounds.
   - Cooperation Rate = (Number of times all players Cooperated) / (Total number of player-rounds so far)
   
2. **Stock Threshold Check**: If the current stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 25% of capacity), always Cooperate to help replenish the stock.

3. **Cooperation vs Defection Decision**:
   - If the Cooperation Rate ≥ 50%, Cooperate.
   - If the Cooperation Rate < 50%, Defect.

#### c. Last Round
In the final round, you will switch to a more exploitative approach:
- If the stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), Defect to maximize your payoff in the last round.
- If the stock is below this threshold, Cooperate to preserve some stock for the final growth phase.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases
- **First Round**: Always Cooperate.
- **Last Round**: Use a threshold-based decision (as above).
- **Low Stock Levels**: When the stock falls below a critical level (e.g., 25% of capacity), always Cooperate to allow stock recovery.

### 3. Exploitative Mindset
This strategy is designed to exploit the cooperation of others while maintaining a sustainable stock level for future rounds. By cooperating when others are cooperative and defecting when they are not, you maximize your payoff over time without completely depleting the resource.

### 4. Pseudocode Representation

Here’s a high-level pseudocode representation of this strategy:

```python
def decide_action(
    current_stock: float,
    capacity: float,
    round_number: int,
    total_rounds: int,
    cooperation_history: list,  # List of all previous actions (C/D) for all players
):
    if round_number == 1:
        return "C"  # Always Cooperate in the first round
    
    # Calculate Cooperation Rate
    total_cooperations = sum(1 for action in cooperation_history if action == "C")
    cooperation_rate = total_cooperations / len(cooperation_history)
    
    # Stock Threshold Check
    stock_threshold = 0.25 * capacity
    if current_stock < stock_threshold:
        return "C"  # Cooperate to replenish the stock
    
    # Last Round Handling
    if round_number == total_rounds:
        last_round_threshold = 0.5 * capacity
        if current_stock > last_round_threshold:
            return "D"  # Defect in the last round if stock is sufficient
        else:
            return "C"  # Cooperate to preserve some stock
    
    # Cooperation vs Defection Decision
    if cooperation_rate >= 0.5:
        return "C"  # Cooperate if others are cooperative
    else:
        return "D"  # Defect if others are not cooperative enough

# Example usage
action = decide_action(
    current_stock=75.0,
    capacity=100.0,
    round_number=3,
    total_rounds=10,
    cooperation_history=["C", "C", "D", "C", "D"],
)
print(action)  # Output: "D"
```

### 5. Robustness and Adaptability
This strategy is robust because it:
- Adapts to the behavior of other players.
- Protects against overexploitation by maintaining a minimum stock level.
- Handles edge cases like the first and last rounds effectively.

By following this approach, you can exploit the cooperation of others while ensuring that the resource remains sustainable for future exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_511 = '''
**Strategy Design for Common Pool Resource Game**

1. **Initial Rounds (First Few Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C)
   - **Rationale:** Start by cooperating to establish a cooperative baseline, encourage others to do the same, and observe their behavior without immediately appearing as a defector.

2. **Monitoring and Adaptation:**
   - **Stock Trend Monitoring:** Continuously track changes in stock levels over rounds.
   - **Trigger Mechanism:** If the stock decreases by more than a predefined threshold (e.g., 20%) over two consecutive rounds, indicating potential widespread defection, switch strategy.
   - **Adaptive Thresholds:** Use dynamic thresholds based on remaining rounds and current stock level to decide when to defect.

3. **Defection Strategy:**
   - **Action Upon Trigger:** Once the trigger condition is met, defect (D) in subsequent rounds to maximize immediate payoffs.
   - **Stock Level Consideration:** If the stock falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 30% of capacity), prioritize defection to secure remaining resources.

4. **Endgame Strategy:**
   - **Last Round Handling:** In the final round, defect to ensure maximum payoff since future stock preservation is no longer relevant.
   - **Near-End Rounds:** Begin transitioning towards defection in the last few rounds if the stock isn't critically low, balancing immediate gains with potential cooperative benefits.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Low Stock Levels:** When stock is critically low (e.g., below 20%), defect to secure any remaining resources.
   - **High Stock Levels:** Maintain cooperation when stock is high or stable to encourage regeneration and sustain long-term payoffs.

6. **Robustness and Exploitability:**
   - The strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, adapting based on observed actions through stock trends.
   - It aims to exploit cooperative tendencies while safeguarding against excessive defection by others.

This approach balances cooperation with strategic defection, ensuring adaptability and maximizing payoffs in a competitive environment.

### Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation in the Common Pool Resource Game

**Objective:** Maximize individual payoff by strategically choosing to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) based on the game's state and history.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **First Round:**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C).
   - **Rationale:** Gather information on others' initial actions without depleting the stock.

2. **Subsequent Rounds (Until Last Round):**
   - **Monitor Past Behavior:**
     - Calculate the average cooperation rate of all players in previous rounds.
   - **Stock Level Check:**
     - If the stock is below 30% of capacity, Cooperate to allow growth.
   - **Cooperation Threshold:**
     - If the average cooperation rate is above 70%, Defect to exploit others' cooperation.
   - **Past Payoff Evaluation:**
     - If total past payoff is below the expected average payoff per round, Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

3. **Last Round:**
   - **Action:** Defect (D).
   - **Rationale:** Maximize immediate payoff as future rounds do not matter.

**Edge Cases Handling:**
- **Stock Preservation:** If the stock is critically low, prioritize conservation by Cooperating.
- **Final Round Opportunism:** Defect in the last round to maximize immediate gain.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def strategy(n, r, capacity, history, current_stock, current_round):
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif current_round == r:
        return "D"
    else:
        avg_coop_rate = calculate_average_cooperation(history)
        if current_stock < 0.3 * capacity:
            return "C"
        if avg_coop_rate > 0.7:
            return "D"
        past_payoff = sum([pi for pi in history['self_payoff']])
        avg_payoff = past_payoff / (current_round - 1)
        if avg_payoff < expected_average_payoff:
            return "C"
        else:
            return "D"
```

**Rationale:**
- **Exploitation:** By defecting when others cooperate more, you gain a higher payoff.
- **Conservation:** Cooperating when the stock is low ensures future resource availability.
- **Adaptation:** Adjust strategy based on others' behavior and personal payoff to balance immediate gain with long-term sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_512 = '''
**Strategy: Adaptive Exploitation for Sustainable Gain**

**1. Conservation Phase (Initial Rounds):**
   - **Action:** Cooperate (C) in the first round to conserve the stock, allowing maximum growth for future rounds.

**2. Exploitation Phase (Middle Rounds):**
   - **Monitor Stock Level:** Check if stock is above a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity).
   - **Assess Cooperation Rate:** Determine if a majority of players are cooperating based on past actions.
   - **Switch to Defect:** If stock is sufficient and others are cooperating, defect to exploit the stock for higher payoffs without severe depletion.

**3. Endgame Phase (Final Rounds):**
   - **Defect Aggressively:** In the last few rounds, defect to maximize immediate payoffs, as future stock is no longer a concern.

**4. Critical Stock Handling:**
   - ** Cooperate if Stock is Low:** If the stock drops below a critical level (e.g., 20% of capacity), cooperate to prevent depletion and ensure some future payoffs.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Initial Rounds:** Start with cooperation to build a high stock level.
2. **Adaptive Switching:** Monitor stock and opponent actions; switch strategies to defect when beneficial.
3. **Endgame Strategy:** Prioritize immediate gains in the final rounds.
4. **Stock Conservation:** Cooperate if the stock is critically low to maintain sustainability.

This strategy balances immediate gains with long-term resource management, adapting to both the stock level and opponents' behaviors to maximize overall payoff.
