 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for N-Player Public Goods Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to foster cooperation and show goodwill.
   - After the first round, your action depends on the actions of other players in the previous round:
     - If all players (or almost all, assuming a tolerance level t where 0 < t < n-1) cooperated in the previous round, cooperate again.
     - If fewer than t players cooperated in the previous round, defect (D).
     - If some players cooperated and others did not, use a majority vote approach to decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the majority action of other players in the previous round.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C).
   - In the last round, cooperate if most players cooperated in the penultimate round; otherwise, defect (D).
   - For other rounds: continue with the adaptive approach as described earlier.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The strategy aims to promote cooperation and rewards cooperation from others while also being resilient to defection.
   - By cooperating when others do and defecting when others don't, it fosters a collective sense of mutual benefits but also retaliates against those who consistently defect.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFT(n, k, r, tolerance_level, history):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        n_cooperators = sum(history[-1])  # Count number of cooperators in the previous round
        if n_cooperators >= (n - tolerance_level):
            action = 'C'  # Cooperate when most players cooperated
        elif n_cooperators < (n - tolerance_level):
            action = 'D'  # Defect when most players didn't cooperate
        else:  # If some players cooperated and others didn't, use a majority vote approach
            if sum(history[-1]) > len(history[-1]) / 2:
                action = 'C'
            else:
                action = 'D'
    return action
```

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive Cooperative (TFTAC)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This gesture is intended to encourage others to reciprocate cooperation and establish a peaceful equilibrium.
   - For subsequent rounds, copy the action of the most frequent cooperator from the previous round (i.e., if the most frequent cooperator contributed in the last round, contribute; otherwise, defect). This rule promotes stable cooperation by rewarding those who have cooperated consistently and punishing those who have defected repeatedly.
   - In the last round, cooperate to maximize potential payoff and maintain a positive image for future games with opponents.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If no players contributed in the previous round, copy your own action from the second-to-last round as a fallback strategy.
   - In case of ties for the most frequent cooperator (i.e., multiple players contributed equally), choose to cooperate if the number of contributors is greater than or equal to the average number of contributors over the previous rounds; otherwise, defect. This rule ensures a balance between cooperation and retaliation in situations where it's unclear which player should be rewarded or punished.

3. Be collective:
   - The TFTAC strategy adopts a collective mindset by promoting mutual cooperation among players. It aims to maintain a stable equilibrium of reciprocal contributions, fostering long-term relationships and maximizing collective benefits.

Pseudocode for the Tit-for-Tat Adaptive Cooperative (TFTAC) strategy:

```
function TFTAC(round_number, player_history):
  if round_number == 1:
    return 'C'  # cooperate in the first round

  most_frequent_cooperators = getMostFrequentCooperators(player_history)
  if len(most_frequent_cooperators) > 1:
    if sum(map(countContributions, most_frequent_cooperators)) >= averageContributions(player_history):
      return 'C'
    else:
      return 'D'

  last_round = player_history[-1]
  if most_frequent_cooperators[0] == last_round['most_frequent_cooperator']:
    return last_round[most_frequent_cooperators[0]]
  else:
    fallback_action = player_history[-2][most_frequent_cooperators[0]]
    return fallback_action if fallback_action == 'C' else 'D'
```

In this pseudocode, `countContributions(player)` counts the number of times a specific player has contributed in their history, and `averageContributions(history)` calculates the average number of contributors over all previous rounds. The strategy is defined to be flexible and adaptive, responding to opponent behavior while maintaining a collective mindset that encourages long-term cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_3 = '''
 In this game, we'll design a strategy called Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT). The ATFT strategy is inspired by the original Tit-for-Tat strategy in game theory but is adapted for the public goods game to be more cooperative and robust against a variety of opponent behaviors.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, players cooperate (play C) as they have no history yet. This encourages cooperation from the beginning.
   - For subsequent rounds t > 1, players consider their own payoff in the previous round and the total contributions of all players (total_contributions_{t-1}):
      - If total_contributions_{t-1} >= average_contribution: Players cooperate if they cooperated previously; defect otherwise. This encourages cooperation when it is prevalent but punishes defection when the majority cooperates.
      - If total_contributions_{t-1} < average_contribution: Players cooperate regardless of their previous action to encourage more cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round (r): Players will cooperate since they have no opportunity to retaliate or receive benefits from cooperating in the following rounds.
   - First round (t = 1): Players cooperate as mentioned before.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy emphasizes cooperation when total contributions exceed the average contribution, promoting a collective mindset by rewarding and punishing players based on their actions.
   - When the majority of players cooperate in a round, the strategy encourages further cooperation, incentivizing a collective effort towards achieving a better payoff for all participants.

Pseudocode representation:

```python
def ATFT(n, r, k):
  history = [] # Initialize history with no contributions yet

  for round in range(r):
    average_contribution = sum(history) / len(history) if history else 0

    if round == 1:
      contribution = 1 # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round < r:
      if len(history) > 0 and total_contributions >= average_contribution:
        contribution = history[-1] if contribution == 1 else 0
      else:
        contribution = 1

    history.append(contribution) # Update the history with the current round's contribution

  return contribution for round in history # Return the player's contributions over all rounds
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_4 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) with Improved Cooperation Probability (ICP)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round t, calculate the average cooperation rate (CR) over the previous r-1 rounds: CR = (Σ(t'=1 to t-1) number_of_cooperators[t']) / (t-1).
   - If CR > 0.5, cooperate with probability ICP; otherwise defect. The ICP is a dynamic value that adjusts based on the current round and historical data:
     - In the first few rounds, ICP starts high to encourage cooperation, e.g., ICP = max(1 - ((t-1) / r), 0.8).
     - As the game progresses, ICP gradually decreases to account for potential free-riders, e.g., ICP = min(ICP * (1 - ((t-r/2) / r)), 0.5).
   - If t=1, cooperate with a high probability, e.g., ICP = 0.8.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, play as calculated by decision rules since there are no future rounds to consider.
   - In case of ties in average cooperation rate calculation (which may occur due to floating-point precision), round up to the nearest integer.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy is designed to foster a collective mindset by encouraging cooperation when the majority of players have cooperated, but also being resilient against potential free-riders or defectors.
   - By using ICP and adjusting it based on historical data, the strategy demonstrates adaptability and robustness to a wide range of opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:

```python
def calculate_ICP(t, r):
    if t < r/2:
        return max(1 - ((t-1) / r), 0.8)
    else:
        return min(ICP * (1 - ((t-r/2) / r)), 0.5)

def play_game(n, k, r):
    player_actions = [C for _ in range(r)]  # initialize player actions as cooperation for all rounds
    total_contributions = 0
    total_player_payoff = 0
    CR = 0

    for t in range(1, r+1):
        total_contributions += sum([1 for action in player_actions[:t]])
        CR = total_contributions / (t-1)
        player_action = C if CR > 0.5 and random.random() <= calculate_ICP(t, r) else D
        player_payoff = (1 - player_action) + (k/n) * total_contributions
        total_player_payoff += player_payoff
        player_actions[t] = player_action

    return total_player_payoff
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_5 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-A)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-A starts by cooperating in the first round (C). For subsequent rounds, it will mimic the actions of the opponent from the previous round (i.e., if the opponent cooperated, so does TFT-A; otherwise, TFT-A defects). If an opponent changes their strategy, TFT-A will respond accordingly and then revert to cooperating after three consecutive defections.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function TFT_A(opponent_actions, n, k, r) {
       my_action[1] = "C"  // Cooperate in the first round
       for t=2 to r {
           if opponent_actions[t-1] == "C" then
               my_action[t] = "C"  // Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
           else
               if count_defects(my_actions, 3) > 0 then
                   my_action[t] = "C"  // Cooperate after three consecutive defections
               else
                   my_action[t] = "D"  // Defect if opponent defected last round
           }
       }
       return my_actions
   }

   function count_defects(actions, count) {
       counter = 0
       for i=count to length(actions) step count {
           if actions[i] == "D" then
               counter++
           }
       }
       return counter
   }
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   TFT-A maintains the same strategy across all rounds and does not have any specific considerations for edge cases like the first or last round.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   TFT-A encourages cooperation by initially cooperating and reciprocating cooperation from opponents. However, it will also defend itself against defections by defecting in response. This strategy is designed to promote a sense of fairness and mutual cooperation while being robust against aggressive or uncooperative behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_6 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Cooperative (TFT-C)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round t, starting from the second round, if a player i's opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), then player i will also cooperate in round t. If the opponent defected in the previous round (t-1), player i will defect in round t as well. This encourages reciprocity and fosters trust.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function TFT_C(opponent_action_history):
       if round = 1:
           return Cooperate (C)
       if opponent_action_history[t-1] == Cooperate (C):
           return Cooperate (C)
       else:
           return Defect (D)
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, players are unsure of their opponents' strategies, so they should cooperate to maximize potential gains and minimize risks. In the last round, players might choose to cooperate or defect based on their current payoff and how close they are to the end of the game. However, for simplicity, TFT-C will maintain its cooperative nature in the first and last rounds.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   By reciprocating cooperation, TFT-C promotes a collective mindset that encourages players to work together for mutual benefit. This strategy seeks to establish trust among players over time by rewarding cooperation and punishing defection in an equal manner. The goal is to foster long-term collaboration rather than short-term gain at the expense of others.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_1 = '''
 In this Public Goods Game, the exploitative strategy aims to maximize its payoff by leveraging the multiplication factor (k) and the number of players (n), while taking advantage of other players' behavior. The strategy is adaptive and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors. Here's an outline for the proposed strategy:

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the initial round, the strategy will cooperate (C) to contribute to the public good as there is no information about other players' behavior yet.
   - For subsequent rounds, the strategy will analyze the total contributions made by opponents in the previous rounds and decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the average contribution rate. If the average contribution rate is below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 50%), the strategy will defect (D) to take advantage of freeloaders. Otherwise, it will cooperate (C) to ensure a better payoff when the majority of opponents are contributing to the public good.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, as mentioned before, the strategy will cooperate regardless of other players' actions.
   - In the last round, the strategy will assess the total contributions made by opponents up to that point and decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the average contribution rate, just like in subsequent rounds.
   - For intermediate rounds, the strategy will follow the decision rule mentioned above, updating the average contribution rate as new information becomes available.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The strategy aims to maximize its payoff by taking advantage of opponents who are not contributing enough to the public good (below 50% on average). In these cases, it will defect to earn a higher private payoff.
   - If most opponents are contributing to the public good, the strategy will cooperate and benefit from the collective effort. However, it is still exploitative as it takes advantage of opponents' cooperation by earning both its endowment and a share of the public good.

Pseudocode for the proposed strategy:

```python
def exploitative_strategy(r, n, k, contribution_history):
    total_contributions = sum(contribution_history)
    avg_contribution_rate = total_contributions / (n * r)

    if round == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

    if avg_contribution_rate < 0.5:
        return "D"  # Defect when opponents are not contributing enough to the public good

    return "C"  # Cooperate when opponents contribute at least 50% on average
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_7 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, compare the total actions of cooperation from previous rounds to the total actions of defection. If the total actions of cooperation are greater than or equal to the total actions of defection, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This rule encourages reciprocity and discourages exploitation.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   if (total_cooperation > total_defection) {
       action = "Cooperate"
   } else {
       action = "Defect"
   }
   ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative environment.
   - In the last round, cooperate if the current stock level is high to potentially secure a higher payoff. Otherwise, defect if the current stock level is low to preserve resources for future rounds.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy always considers the collective good (common pool resource) and aims to maintain a balanced exploitation of it across all players.

In addition, the ATFT strategy incorporates forgiveness by resetting the cooperation-defection count after each round to prevent long-term grudges that could lead to unnecessary defections. This promotes ongoing cooperation even when faced with deviations from mutual cooperation.

The overall objective of the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy is to maximize payoff while maintaining a sustainable common pool resource for future rounds. Its adaptability allows it to respond to various opponent behaviors and promote a cooperative environment, which can lead to better overall outcomes compared to purely selfish strategies in this repeated game scenario.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_8 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and establish a cooperative starting point.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, also defect. This encourages reciprocity while being forgiving of occasional defections.
   - In case of no prior interaction (e.g., first meeting with an opponent), start by cooperating as a goodwill gesture.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize potential payoff and show goodwill for future interactions.
   - In the case of no stock (i.e., depletion), wait for the stock growth calculation and use the remaining stock as a reference point for decision making in that round.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes sustainable resource management by focusing on long-term cooperation while also being responsive to opponents' actions. This collective mindset aims at striking a balance between self-interest and the common good.

Pseudocode for ATFT Strategy:

```python
def ATFT(round, history, opponent_action_history, capacity, n):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C' # Cooperate in initial round
  elif round == r:
    return 'C' # Cooperate in last round for max payoff
  else:
    current_opponent_action = opponent_action_history[-1]
    if current_opponent_action not in history:
      return 'C' # First interaction, cooperate as a goodwill gesture
    return history[-1] # Mimic last own action to encourage reciprocity
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_9 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   The ACT strategy uses a Cooperative Probability Threshold (CPT), which dynamically adjusts based on the current state and history of the game.

   Pseudocode for CPT calculation:
   ```
   CPT = initial_CPT + (history_length * (average_stock - initial_stock) / (capacity - initial_stock))
   ```
   The initial_CPT is a predefined value that sets the default cooperation tendency. History_length is the number of completed rounds, average_stock is the moving average of the stock level over history_length rounds, and capacity is the maximum sustainable stock level.

   In each round, if CPT > 0.5, the player cooperates (chooses action C), otherwise defects (action D).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   For the first round, the initial_CPT is used to make a decision based on its default cooperation tendency.
   In the last round, since there will be no growth or recovery of the stock, players should choose actions that maximize their payoff for that particular round. The ACT strategy will continue using CPT for this decision but with a slight modification to account for the final round.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   Although the ACT strategy does not rely on others sharing norms or predetermined patterns, it encourages cooperation by adjusting its CPT based on the state of the common pool resource and previous rounds' outcomes. As the stock level decreases due to overconsumption, the CPT increases, promoting cooperative behavior among players to conserve the resource for future rounds. Conversely, as the stock level recovers or remains stable, the CPT decreases, allowing for more defection and competition among players.

   By aligning with this collective mindset, the ACT strategy strives to balance cooperation and competition, promoting a sustainable long-term outcome for all players while adapting to various opponent behaviors in tournament settings.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_10 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially cooperate in the first round (C) to contribute positively to the common pool and show goodwill towards other players.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the actions of the opponents from the previous round (i.e., if all players cooperated, continue cooperating; if any player defected, also defect). This builds trust and punishes defection but is not overly aggressive or unforgiving. If multiple opponents acted differently, choose a simple approach like always defecting in that situation to maintain consistency.
   - Modify the strategy slightly by introducing forgiveness for initial defections. In the first few rounds (e.g., first 5), if an opponent defected initially but later cooperates, return to cooperating yourself. This encourages potential defectors to change their behavior and promotes cooperation in the long run.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) as described above.
   - In the last round, if the stock is depleted or almost depleted, always defect to maximize individual payoff since there are no future rounds. Otherwise, mimic the behavior of opponents from the previous round.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:
   - The ATfT strategy emphasizes cooperation when others cooperate and punishes defection while maintaining forgiveness for initial mistakes. This encourages a collaborative environment where players benefit from mutual cooperation and learn to trust each other over time.

Pseudocode for the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy:

```python
def adaptive_tit_for_tat(n, r, capacity, stock, round, history):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C' # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        last_round_history = history[-1]
        if all(last_round_history == 'C'): # If all players cooperated last round, also cooperate this round
            action = 'C'
        elif any(last_round_history == 'D'): # If any player defected last round, also defect this round
            action = 'D'
        else: # If multiple opponents acted differently, choose a simple approach like always defecting in that situation
            action = 'D'

    if round < 5 and action == 'D': # Forgiveness for initial defections
        forgiven_defection = False
        for opponent_history in history:
            if opponent_history[round - 1] == 'C': # If an opponent defected initially but later cooperates, return to cooperating yourself
                action = 'C'
                forgiven_defection = True
                break
        if not forgiven_defection: # If no forgiveness has been granted yet, continue defecting in the first few rounds

description_COLLECTIVE_11 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initiate with Cooperate (C): Start by cooperating to encourage cooperation from others and minimize initial stock depletion.
   - Respond with Defect (D) if defected in the previous round: If a player defects, the A-TFT strategy will also defect in the next round as punishment for not adhering to the initial cooperative approach.
   - Revert to Cooperate after being cooperated with: If a player switches from Defect to Cooperate, A-TFT will respond by cooperating again, fostering forgiveness and encouraging long-term cooperation.
   - Maintain Cooperate if no change in opponent's strategy from the previous round: If an opponent continues with the same strategy (either cooperate or defect), A-TFT will also stick to the current cooperative response to maintain consistency and avoid unnecessary stock depletion.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Start by cooperating as a gesture of goodwill and to minimize initial stock depletion.
   - Last Round (or when r is reached): Continue with the current strategy, since this is the final round and any further interactions will not affect the overall payoff.
   - Stock Depletion (0 stock): If the stock reaches zero due to excessive consumption, A-TFT will switch to cooperate as a last resort to initiate recovery of the common pool resource.

3. Collective Mindset:
   A-TFT strategy emphasizes maintaining a balance between cooperation and punishment while preserving long-term sustainability of the common pool resource. The primary goal is to encourage cooperation among players, ensuring that they work together to maintain an acceptable stock level for all rounds. By adopting a collective mindset, A-TFT aims to promote sustainable resource management in the repeated game setting.

Pseudocode:
```
function A_TFT(round, opponentStrategy, stock, capacity) {

description_COLLECTIVE_12 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C): The initial cooperation sets a positive tone and encourages reciprocity in future rounds.
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C) in the current round: This is the Tit-for-Tat strategy's principle of reciprocation. By doing so, we reinforce the cooperative behavior of others while fostering trust and cooperation over time.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round: The ATfT strategy responds with defection to punish the opponent's non-cooperative action from the previous round. This punishment serves as a deterrent against future defections and encourages opponents to return to cooperation.
   - If the game is the last round, cooperate (C): Even if an opponent has been uncooperative throughout the game, it may be advantageous in the final round to encourage them to cooperate or at least minimize negative consequences for both parties.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) regardless of the current state or history.
   - If the game is the last round, cooperate (C), as mentioned above.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The ATfT strategy encourages a collective approach by promoting cooperation among players and responding to defection with defection to discourage future non-cooperative behavior.
   - By following the principle of reciprocity, the ATfT strategy fosters trust, collaboration, and long-term stability in the common pool resource game.

Pseudocode:
```python
def AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, stock, round, history):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
  else:
    last_opponent_action = history[round-1][own_index]  # Get own previous action
    if last_opponent_action == "C":
      action = "C"  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated in the previous round
    elif last_opponent_action == "D":
      action = "D"  # Defect if opponent defected in the previous round

description_COLLECTIVE_13 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-based Tit-for-Tat (AFTFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average consumption per player (APC) over the entire game so far. Calculate APC as `sum(total_consumption)/r`.
   - If APC < mean_APC, cooperate (action C). This encourages cooperation when resource usage is below the historical average.
   - If APC > mean_APC, defect (action D). This responds with defection when resource usage exceeds the historical average.
   - If APC = mean_APC, randomly choose between C and D to add some randomness and prevent predictability.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (mean_APC is not defined yet).
   - In the last round, consider the current average consumption per player (CAP) instead of mean_APC. Cooperate if CAP < 2 and defect otherwise. This encourages cooperation at the end of the game when the stock might be low.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy aims to promote collective resource management by adapting its actions based on the group's consumption patterns. By rewarding moderation and punishing excess, it hopes to foster a sense of shared responsibility and sustainable resource usage among players.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe and adapt to opponent's behavior based on the Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT).
     - If opponent cooperates, copy their action in the next round.
     - If opponent defects, evaluate whether the stock has fallen below the ACT. If it has, defect in the next round to protect the common pool; otherwise, continue cooperating.
   - As the game progresses, adjust the ACT dynamically based on the average number of opponents that have cooperated during the past few rounds (e.g., if more opponents are cooperative, raise the ACT threshold to encourage cooperation, and vice versa).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize protecting the remaining stock by applying the ACT decision rule based on the current state of the common pool.
   - If the ACT is not defined yet or when first entering the game (initial round), cooperate as a default action to initiate cooperation.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a balance between self-interest and collective wellbeing by encouraging cooperation but also ensuring the common pool is protected against overexploitation.
   - Foster trust with opponents by mimicking their behavior and being consistent in return.
   - Adapt to opponent's actions and adjust the ACT threshold based on recent history to remain effective in various game scenarios.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C): The idea is to begin with a collaborative approach, showing willingness to share and build trust.
   - For subsequent rounds t ≥ 2:
      - If opponent cooperated in the previous round t-1, cooperate (C). This reflects continued cooperation as long as the other player also cooperates.
      - If opponent defected in the previous round t-1, defect (D) in this round. This strategy punishes defection but is also ready to forgive and rebuild trust if the opponent changes their behavior.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round (r): Cooperate regardless of the previous action of the opponent, as there are no further rounds for retaliation or forgiveness. Maximize payoff in the final round.
   - First Round (t=1): Cooperate to show goodwill and establish a cooperative relationship if possible.
   - Empty Stock (S=0): In this extreme edge case, neither cooperation nor defection is possible because there's no common pool resource left. The strategy should pause until the stock is replenished.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATFT strategy focuses on maintaining a stable and sustainable relationship with other players by balancing cooperation and defection based on past actions. This collaborative approach aims to maximize overall group welfare while punishing excessive exploitation.

Pseudocode for the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy:

```python
def ATFT(t, history, opponent_action):
  if t == 1:
    return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

  if opponent_action != history[t - 1]:
    return "D"  # Defect if opponent's action differs from previous round

  return "C"  # Cooperate if opponent's action matches previous round
```

description_COLLECTIVE_16 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, the ATFT strategy initially cooperates (plays C). After that, it responds to the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, ATFT also cooperates; if the opponent defected, ATFT defects in the subsequent round. This mimics a forgiving and cooperative behaviour but punishes defection with a single round of deflection, encouraging long-term cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
def strategy(opponent_action_history):
  if len(opponent_action_history) == 0:
    return 'C' (Cooperate)
  else:
    last_opponent_action = opponent_action_history[-1]
    if last_opponent_action == 'C':
      return 'C'
    else:
      return 'D'
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, ATFT cooperates as specified above. For the last round, it is important to consider that the payoff depends on the final stock level. To maximize the total game payoff, ATFT should prioritize accumulating a higher stock level in the penultimate round, so it continues cooperating even if the opponent defects in the second-last round.

Pseudocode:
```
def strategy(opponent_action_history, round_number):
  # ... (previous pseudocode)

  if round_number == r - 1:  # last round
    return 'C' if len(opponent_action_history) < r - 2 else strategy(opponent_action_history + ['D'], round_number)
```

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   The ATFT strategy promotes cooperation as it encourages players to reciprocate cooperative behaviour while punishing defection. This collectively leads to a more sustainable common pool resource and potentially higher total game payoffs for all players compared to defective strategies in repeated interactions.

description_COLLECTIVE_17 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Preservation (ASP)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
- ASP aims at maintaining a balance between resource consumption and stock preservation, adjusting its actions based on the current round, stock level, and past history.
- In each round, ASP calculates an Adaptive Consumption Threshold (ACT) based on the remaining capacity, number of players, and the stage of the game (initial, intermediate, or final).
- If the current stock level is above ACT, ASP will cooperate to preserve resources. Otherwise, it will defect to consume more but not exceed the stock limit.
- Pseudocode for ACT calculation:
```
def ACT(n, capacity, round):
  if round == 1:
    return capacity / n * 0.95
  elif round < r:
    return capacity / (2n) * (r - round + 1)
  else:
    return capacity / (2n) * 0.8
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
- In the first round, ASP aims to preserve as much stock as possible while avoiding being exploited by other players. It consumes less than the optimal amount of resources given its ACT calculation but more than the minimum needed for survival.
- As the game progresses towards the final rounds, ASP adjusts its strategy to account for diminishing returns from resource preservation and increased pressure to maximize payoffs.
- Pseudocode for decision making in the first round:
```
if round == 1:
  if stock > ACT:
    return "Cooperate"
  else:
    return "Defect"
```
- Pseudocode for decision making in the last round:
```
if round == r:
  if stock > ACT:
    return "Cooperate"
  elif stock >= (capacity / n):
    return "Defect"
  else:
    return "Cooperate"
```

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
- ASP is designed to promote cooperation when possible, as it recognizes that preserving the common pool resource benefits all players in the long run.
- However, when faced with opponents who consistently defect or show signs of short-termism, ASP will also adapt its strategy accordingly and be willing to defect if necessary.
- In general, ASP strives for a balance between cooperation and self-interest, prioritizing collective welfare while ensuring its own survival and success within the game.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, start by cooperating (C). This sets a cooperative tone and provides a chance to build a mutual relationship.
   - For subsequent rounds, match the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect in response. This approach encourages reciprocity and discourages one-time defections.
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action. This allows for the potential growth of resources during the final round.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - If it is not the first or last round, and the opponent has not played yet (no history), assume cooperation as a default assumption and cooperate yourself in that round.
   - If the stock level drops below 0 after consumption, the game ends with negative payoffs since the growth cannot be calculated due to the minimum stock constraint. In this case, resume playing from the initial state with capacity stock for subsequent rounds.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy seeks to build and maintain long-term relationships based on reciprocity, which can lead to mutual benefits in a collective sense. By responding to opponents' actions, the strategy encourages cooperation when it persists and punishes defection when it occurs.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round == r:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate (C). This sets a peaceful tone and demonstrates goodwill to potential partners.
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, defect otherwise. This strategy fosters long-term cooperation by rewarding cooperative opponents and retaliating against those who defect. It aims to encourage stable relationships while also protecting from exploitation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous move. This is a conciliatory gesture to end the game on a positive note.
   - For the first and last few rounds, consider adopting a slightly more tolerant approach to allow for strategic adaptation to new opponents and situations. For example, if an opponent starts by defecting in the first round, ATFT will still cooperate in the second round as a second chance to establish cooperation.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Our strategy prioritizes long-term collaboration and mutual benefits over immediate rewards. It encourages reciprocity and fosters trust by responding positively to cooperation and retaliating against defection in a controlled manner. This collective approach aims to promote stable, cooperative relationships with opponents while also protecting the common pool resource from depletion.

   - Subsequent Rounds (2 ≤ t ≤ r): Analyze opponent's behavior in the previous round and respond accordingly. If the opponent cooperated (C) in the last round, cooperate again (C). If the opponent defected (D), defect in the current round (D). This rule promotes reciprocity and trust, but also allows for retaliation against defection.
   - Last Round (t=r): Cooperate unconditionally to maximize payoff in the final round, regardless of the opponent's behavior in the previous rounds.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Stock depletion (stock = 0): If stock reaches zero due to overconsumption by opponents, set the stock level to the capacity value to avoid negative numbers and ensure continued gameplay.
   - Empty Rounds: In case of missed or skipped rounds, simply resume the strategy from the next available round without any adjustments.

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize cooperation to contribute to a stable common pool resource level for all players.
   - Maintain adaptability by responding to opponent's actions while fostering an environment of mutual benefit and reciprocity. This encourages the development of collective strategies over time, as opponents may gradually learn to cooperate in response to ATFT's cooperative behavior.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TFTG) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - TFTG initially cooperates in the first round to contribute positively to the common pool and show goodwill.
   - In subsequent rounds, TFTG evaluates its previous round's action based on whether it was cooperated or defected.
       - If TFTG cooperated and the common pool grew, it will continue to cooperate to further support growth.
       - If TFTG cooperated but the common pool did not grow, it will defect to encourage other players to contribute more.
       - If TFTG defected in the previous round, it will cooperate to make amends and help restore the common pool.
       - If TFTG defected and the common pool shrank, it will continue defecting as a punishment for poor resource management by other players.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, TFTG cooperates to initiate a positive cycle.
   - In the last round, TFTG evaluates the current common pool state to determine its action. If the remaining capacity is sufficient for all players to get a reasonable payoff, it will cooperate; otherwise, it will defect. This allows TFTG to maximize its total game payoff while avoiding depleting the resource too drastically in the final round.
   - In case of a tie (equal number of cooperators and defectors), TFTG decides based on whether the common pool grew or shrank in the previous round. If it grew, TFTG will cooperate; if it shrank, TFTG will defect to encourage more contribution from others.

3. Being Collective:
   - TFTG's primary goal is to ensure a sustainable resource level for all players while maximizing individual payoffs over the long run. It prioritizes cooperation when it contributes positively to common pool growth and encourages cooperation in others by defecting when necessary.
   - TFTG aims to establish trust within the group, as repeated cooperative actions may induce other players to reciprocate and build a collective mindset focused on resource conservation.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFTG(n, r, capacity, stock, round) {
  if (round === 1) return "C"   // Cooperate in the first round
  previous_action = getLastRoundAction()
  previous_stock = getLastStockLevel()

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
The ATFT strategy starts by cooperating in the first round to build trust and maintain a positive starting stock level. In subsequent rounds, it adopts the following rule: If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, return the cooperation. If the opponent defected, defect this round as a punishment, but revert to cooperation in the next round, hoping for future reciprocity. This approach encourages long-term cooperation while still punishing defection.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
ATFT is designed to promote long-term cooperation and reciprocity, which aligns with a collective approach. By fostering trust, it encourages players to work together towards maintaining a healthy common stock level that benefits everyone in the long run.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C), demonstrating goodwill and cooperation as a starting point.
   - Subsequent Rounds (t>1): Analyze opponent's strategy based on the previous round's outcome, and respond accordingly. If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate with cooperation (C). If an opponent defected, also defect in the current round (D) as a punishment for exploitation, but return to cooperation in the next round if they subsequently cooperate again.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATFT(opponent_strategy, round):
    strategy = {1: 'C', *(round > 1): opponent_strategy[round - 1]}
    return strategy[round]
```

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (r<t≤∞): Cooperate, regardless of the opponent's previous action, as there are no subsequent rounds for payoff accumulation or further retaliation.
   - First Round (t=1): As mentioned earlier, cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and set a cooperative starting point.

3. Being Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy is collectively minded by prioritizing cooperation as the default action and only defecting when provoked or exploited by an opponent. This approach fosters long-term cooperation and promotes collective welfare, as long as opponents reciprocate with cooperation.

The ATFT strategy is adaptive and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors, as it responds flexibly to various strategies while maintaining a cooperative stance when appropriate. It assumes no predetermined patterns or coordination mechanisms but instead relies on simple, self-regulating decision rules that encourage mutual cooperation when possible.

description_COLLECTIVE_25 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   The ATFT strategy begins by cooperating in the first round to demonstrate good faith and promote cooperation. Subsequent decisions are based on the opponent's previous move. If the opponent cooperates, the AI also cooperates; if the opponent defects, the AI defects in the next round. After a defection, the AI will gradually revert back to cooperation over time to encourage reciprocation from the opponent.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function ATFT(opponent_move):
       if current_round = 1:
           return COOPERATE
       previous_opponent_move = opponent_move in the previous round
       if previous_opponent_move == COOPERATE:
           return COOPERATE
       if current_round - previous_opponent_defection >= forgiveness_limit:
           return COOPERATE
       else:
           return DEFECT
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   Since the AI starts by cooperating regardless of context, there's no specific need for an exception for the first round. However, it is important to implement a forgiveness limit, which determines how long the AI should hold grudges after an opponent's defection. A higher forgiveness limit encourages more forgiving behavior and patience in pursuing cooperation.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function ATFT(opponent_move):
       forgiveness_limit = 4  // adjustable parameter for the number of rounds to forgive defections
       ...
   ```

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   The AI's primary objective is to maintain a sustainable common pool resource for long-term success while encouraging cooperation among players. By adapting its behavior based on opponents' actions, the ATFT strategy demonstrates a commitment to both individual and collective success.

   It is essential to note that this strategy does not rely on coordination mechanisms or shared norms, but instead focuses on reactive behavior towards other strategies in the tournament. The AI will continue to cooperate if it encounters other players following similar reciprocal strategies. However, the ATFT may perform poorly when facing uncooperative opponents who do not reciprocate cooperation.

   To improve performance against a wider range of opponents, one can explore variants of this strategy that incorporate elements like punishment (defecting more frequently to discourage defection) or leniency (shorter forgiveness limits for encouraging quicker returns to cooperation). Ultimately, the success of these strategies depends on both their individual design and how well they anticipate the collective behavior of other AI opponents in the tournament.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to signal a willingness for long-term cooperation and establish trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the actions of other players from the previous round and respond accordingly:
     - If all players cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round.
     - If any player defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to demonstrate a commitment to fairness and punish deviations.
   - Introduce a gradual forgiveness mechanism: after a series of defections (defined as 'defection streak'), gradually reduce the number of consecutive defeats required to trigger cooperation again. This helps rebuild trust and promotes long-term cooperation.
     - For example, if the defect streak is set at 3, after three rounds of defection by an opponent, start cooperating again, even if the opponent continues to defect in subsequent rounds.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate as a final attempt to maximize payoff, regardless of previous actions.
   - In the first round, cooperate as described above.

3. Be collective:
   - Maintain cooperation with players who reciprocate, fostering mutual trust and long-term success for all.
   - Pursue defection against those who repeatedly take advantage of the cooperation, demonstrating a strong stance on fairness and encouraging others to follow suit.
   - Gradually forgive opponents who demonstrate a change in behavior, rebuilding trust and promoting collective success.

 Title: Titan Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperation (C): When current stock is greater than or equal to a threshold T_coop, the agent cooperates. This encourages conservation when resources are plentiful, ensuring sustainability in the long run.
   - Defection (D): When the current stock is less than T_coop, the agent defects. This allows for higher consumption when resources are abundant but discourages excessive depletion when they are scarce.

The threshold T_coop is a dynamic value that adjusts based on the remaining number of rounds and the current state of the resource pool.

Pseudocode:
```
function decideAction(n, r, stock, roundNum):
    if roundNum == 1 then
        return D if stock < n/2 else C
    else if roundNum == r then
        return C no matter what the stock is (conserve for last round)
    else
        T_coop = capacity / (2 * (n + roundNum - 2))
        return C if stock >= T_coop else D
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, the agent defects when the stock is low to secure a substantial payoff but cooperates otherwise to conserve resources for later rounds.
   - In the last round, the agent always cooperates regardless of the current stock level to maximize the remaining resource pool.

3. Be Collective:
   The strategy aligns with the collective mindset by promoting cooperation when there are sufficient resources and encouraging conservation as the game progresses. By doing so, it seeks to balance individual payoffs with long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Evolution (TfT-E) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock level is above the average sustainable stock level (Average Stock Level, ASL). This encourages conservation and cooperative behaviour in resource abundance.
     Pseudocode: If stock > ASL then action = C else action = D

   - Defect (D) only when either the stock level falls below 2n or another player has defected in the previous round, promoting tit-for-tat behaviour to punish defection. This prevents immediate exploitation and encourages long-term cooperation.
     Pseudocode: If (stock <= 2n or history[round - 1][i] = D) then action = D else action = C

   - Update Average Stock Level (ASL): At the end of each round, update ASL as the average stock level from the last r rounds. This allows for adaptation to dynamic changes in the game state and player behaviours over time.
     Pseudocode: ASL[round] = (r * ASL[round - 1] + stock[round]) / (r + 1)

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First round: Cooperate as there is no history or previous actions to consider. This promotes a cooperative and optimistic start to the game.
     Pseudocode: If round = 1 then action = C

   - Last round: Cooperate if the current stock level is above average, otherwise defect to maximize individual payoff.
     Pseudocode: If round = r then if (stock > ASL[round]) then action = C else action = D

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Prioritize sustainability: Focus on maintaining a healthy stock level for long-term survival and cooperation among players.
   - Be forgiving: Forgive past defections by other players, encouraging the restoration of cooperative relationships after conflicts.
   - Encourage reciprocity: Respond to cooperative actions with similar behaviour, fostering trust and stable collaborations over time.

   - In subsequent rounds, replicate the opponent's action from the previous round (tit-for-tat approach). If the opponent cooperated in the last round, continue cooperating; if not, defect for one round and then resume cooperating.
   - The strategy encourages cooperation when reciprocated but also retaliates slightly after defection to discourage exploitation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round (t=1), players will always cooperate (C).
   - In the last round (t=r), players should cooperate if and only if the opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1). If not, play according to the tit-for-tat approach by defecting (D) in the last round and then resuming cooperation in hypothetical future rounds.
   - In cases where opponents do not follow the expected pattern of cooperation or defection, the strategy will remain adaptive and continue its tit-for-tat behavior without assuming any coordination mechanisms or communication between players.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy promotes a collective mindset by emphasizing mutual cooperation when reciprocated. It encourages sustained cooperation while still being robust against exploitation.
   - The strategy does not rely on the assumption of others sharing norms or predetermined patterns; it is self-regulating and adaptive to various opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to initiate cooperation and set a baseline for future interactions.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's previous action (either C or D). If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate with cooperation. If the opponent defected, also defect in the current round. This tit-for-tat approach encourages mutual cooperation and punishes defection.
   - If a player encounters an opponent who has always defected (i.e., no prior cooperation), they will continue to defect as well, but if there's a change in behavior and the opponent cooperates, the ATFT strategy will cooperate in response. This allows for forgiveness and the possibility of restoring cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, the ATFT strategy will cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize potential payoff.
   - For the initial stock level (S), the strategy does not have a specific preference and treats it as an external parameter.

3. Being Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy aims to foster cooperation and adheres to a collective mindset by reciprocating cooperative actions from opponents while punishing defection. This promotes long-term sustainable resource management within the group.

Pseudocode for Adaptive Tit-for-Tat:

```python
def ATFT(opponent_action, round, r, history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    if round == r:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the last round

    if opponent_action == 'C':
        return 'C'  # Reciprocate cooperation

    if not history or all(history[-1] == 'D'):
        return 'D'  # If no prior cooperation or always defect, defect
    else:
        return 'C'  # If there was a change in behavior, cooperate

 Title: Fitness-Proportionate Adaptive Strategy (FPAS) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round t, each player i decides whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D).
   - Player i evaluates the average stock level over the last 5 rounds (Wt), and compares it with the initial capacity (C).
     - If Wt > C/2, player i chooses to cooperate (C)
     - If Wt < C/4, player i chooses to defect (D)
     - Otherwise, player i uses a random selection mechanism with a bias towards cooperation (probability of 3:1 in favor of C).

2. Edge cases:
   - In the first round, players have no history. Therefore, they use their random selection mechanism with a default bias towards cooperation.
   - In the last round, players look at their average stock level over the entire game so far (W), and apply the same decision rules as for regular rounds.

3. Collective mindset:
   - The strategy prioritizes maintaining a healthy common pool resource by cooperating when the resource is abundant (Wt > C/2).
   - By defecting only when the resource is critically depleted (Wt < C/4), players avoid overexploitation and foster long-term sustainability.
   - The random selection mechanism, biased towards cooperation, encourages collaborative behavior among players, even in the absence of coordination mechanisms or shared norms.

Pseudocode:

```python
def FPAS(t, r, Wt, capacity, n):
  if t == 1 or t == r:
    bias = 0.75  # default cooperation bias for first and last rounds
  else:
    bias = 0.25  # standard cooperation bias for regular rounds

  if Wt > capacity/2:
    action = 'C'  # cooperate
  elif Wt < capacity/4:
    action = 'D'  # defect
  else:
    roll = rand(1)  # random number between 0 and 1
    if roll <= bias:
      action = 'C'  # cooperate with a certain probability
    else:
      action = 'D'  # defect otherwise

  return action

 For this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy named "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Adjustment" (ATFSGA). This strategy aims to strike a balance between cooperation and competition while being adaptive and robust to various opponent behaviors.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) as an act of goodwill and trust, setting the initial stock growth in motion.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the previous round's behavior of all opponents using the following rules:
     a. If all players cooperated (C), continue cooperating (the stock is growing, and it benefits everyone).
     b. If all players defected (D) in the last round, also defect this round to punish opponents for depleting the stock unnecessarily.
     c. If there's a mix of cooperation and defection, adapt as follows:
       i. If the number of cooperators increased from the previous round, cooperate to encourage further cooperation.
       ii. If the number of cooperators remained the same or decreased, defect to signal discontent with opponents' actions and encourage a change in behavior.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, evaluate the current stock level:
     a. If the stock is depleted (0), defect to ensure no further loss of resources.
     b. If the stock is close to capacity or growing, cooperate to leave as much resource for future rounds if there are any.
   - In the first round, when the stock is initially at maximum capacity, it's optional to either start with cooperation or defection depending on the desired starting strategy (e.g., being generous by starting with cooperation or showing strength by defecting).

3. Be collective:
   - The primary objective of ATFSGA is to promote cooperation and sustainability in the common pool resource, while also responding to opponents' actions in a flexible yet firm manner. This encourages long-term cooperation and growth, as well as penalizing overexploitation.
   - By adapting to changes in opponent behavior, ATFSGA remains responsive to collective interests, adjusting its strategy based on the group dynamics observed in each round.

Pseudocode for ATFSGA:

```python
function ATFSGA(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    if round = 1:
        action = C
    else:
        previous_round_cooperators = count_cooperators(history[-1])
        if all_players_cooperated(history[-1]):
            action = C
        elif all_players_defected(history[-1]):
            action = D
        else:
            if previous_round_cooperators >= n - 1:
                action = C
            else:
                action = D

    if round = r:
        if stock < capacity * 0.9:
            action = D

            action = C

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate initially (First move) to signal good faith and foster trust.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of past actions by opponents as there will be no subsequent rounds to retaliate.
   - In the first round (after initial cooperation), defect if any opponent defects, and cooperate otherwise to encourage future cooperation.

3. Be collective:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
- In the first round, cooperate to promote cooperation and goodwill.
- After the first round, observe and mimic the opponent's previous move (cooperate if they cooperated last round, defect if they defected).
- If the opponent's actions are inconsistent or unpredictable, default to cooperating initially until the opponent establishes a pattern, then follow TFT-like behavior.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
- In the first round, cooperate regardless of the situation as described above.
- In the last round, consider the current stock level:
  - If there is enough stock for all players to get a payoff greater than or equal to their average payoff in previous rounds, cooperate to maximize the overall gain for the entire game.
  - Otherwise, defect to minimize the potential loss of the remaining resources.
- In other edge cases (e.g., mid-game transitions), evaluate the opponent's behavior and adjust strategy accordingly while prioritizing cooperation when the stock level allows it.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
- Prioritize long-term sustainability by adhering to a cooperative approach as much as possible, thus maintaining a healthy common pool for future generations (i.e., rounds).
- Encourage other players to follow this cooperative stance by reciprocating their actions.
- When necessary, act unilaterally to protect the collective good and ensure the persistence of the resource pool for subsequent games.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (ATFSG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C). Begin with a cooperative gesture to foster a positive relationship and encourage cooperation in future rounds.
   - Subsequent Rounds (2 ≤ t ≤ r): If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round. If the opponent defected, also defect in the current round. This reciprocal strategy aims to balance cooperation with punishing defections.
   - Stock Growth Adjustment: After each round, if the stock growth is greater than a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of the current stock level), switch from cooperating to defecting in the next round to account for favorable conditions and incentivize opponents to maintain cooperation.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Cooperate regardless of opponent's previous action as there are no future rounds to consider.
   - Low Stock Levels: If the stock falls below 50% of its maximum capacity, switch from cooperating to defecting in the next round to prevent excessive depletion of resources.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and defection while being responsive to stock growth and current stock levels. This strategy encourages long-term cooperation while also being prepared to defend against overexploitation of resources.
   - Aligning with the collective mindset involves promoting a sustainable use of resources, which benefits both the individual player and the community as a whole in the long run. By cooperating when others do and retaliating when necessary, the strategy fosters an environment conducive to cooperation while also deterring selfish behavior.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Stock Management (TFT-ASM)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round, TFT-ASM starts by checking if the average consumption per player in the previous r-1 rounds is less than or equal to the optimal consumption for cooperation (i.e., stock / (2n)). If so, the agent will cooperate (C); otherwise, it will defect (D). The purpose of this rule is to encourage cooperation when others are also cooperating and punish defection by mirroring their actions.

Pseudocode:
```python
def decideAction(rounds_history):
    avg_consumption = sum(consumption for consumption in rounds_history[-r+1:-1]) / (r-1)
    if avg_consumption <= stock / (2*n):
        return 'C'  # Cooperate
    else:
        return 'D'  # Defect
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
For the initial round, TFT-ASM will choose to cooperate since there is no history available to base its decision on. For the last round, it will continue using its regular decision rule as it does not know if the game will be repeated or not.

Pseudocode:
```python
def first_round(stock):
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the initial round

def final_round():
    return decideAction([])  # Use regular decision rule in the last round
```

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
TFT-ASM aims to foster a cooperative environment by adhering to the " tit for tat" strategy, rewarding cooperation and punishing defection. By doing so, it encourages other players to cooperate and maintain a sustainable common stock level over time. However, since there are no predetermined norms or coordination mechanisms, TFT-ASM will be flexible and adaptive to different opponent behaviors while promoting collective interests.

 For this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy named "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adjustment" (ATfTGA). This strategy seeks to balance cooperation and defection based on the game's parameters, current state, and historical interactions.

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially cooperate in the first round (S_t=0): C(0) = True
   - In subsequent rounds, decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the following conditions:
     a) If all opponents have previously cooperated (C(t-1) for all i≠j), continue cooperation: C(t) = True
     b) If any opponent has previously defected (D(t-1) for some i≠j) and the current stock is less than the initial capacity/n, defect: C(t) = False
     c) In all other cases, cooperate if the current stock growth would be positive, otherwise defect: C(t) = (growth > 0)

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last round (r < t): Cooperate as there are no future rounds to consider the impact of defection.
   - First round (t=1): Initially cooperate regardless of historical interactions.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy is designed with a collective mindset, prioritizing cooperation when all opponents have previously cooperated and striving for sustainable resource management by considering the stock growth in decision-making.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfTGA(t, i, n, r, capacity, stock, history) {
  if t == 1 then // First round
    return C(i, t) = True

  for j ∈ {1 to n} and j != i do
    if history[j][t-1] == 'C' then
      cooperation_count += 1

  if cooperation_count == n then // All opponents have previously cooperated
    return C(i, t) = True

  if stock < capacity/n then // Current stock is less than initial capacity/n
    for j ∈ {1 to n} do
      if history[j][t-1] == 'D' then

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFTA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, the TFTA strategy follows these rules:

- First Round: Cooperate (C). This is an act of goodwill and sets a cooperative tone for future interactions.
- Subsequent Rounds: Analyze opponent's previous action. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, then cooperate; otherwise, defect. This simple rule promotes cooperation when met with cooperation and retaliates with defection against defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

- First Round: Cooperate as described above.
- Last Round (or near end of game): Since the stock will eventually deplete to zero without any growth, it's essential to maximize payoffs by cooperating in the last few rounds. TFTA can switch to a more forgiving strategy, such as always cooperating from the round where the remaining capacity is below a certain threshold (e.g., 2n).
- Other edge cases: No specific adjustments are required for other edge cases, as the general rule of cooperating with cooperators and defecting with defectors remains effective throughout the game.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

The TFTA strategy seeks to promote cooperation among players, understanding that a healthy common pool resource is beneficial for all participants in the long run. By retaliating against defection but forgiving cooperators, TFTA encourages players to maintain sustainable resource use and build trust over time.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFTA(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C" (Cooperate)
  else:
    if last_opponent_action == "C":
      action = "C" (Cooperate)
    else:
      action = "D" (Defect)

  consume_stock = {0, 1}/n for action in {"C", "D"}
  total_consumption = Σ(i=1 to n) consume_stock[players[i]]
  stock_after_consumption = stock - total_consumption
  growth = 2 * stock_after_consumption * (1 - stock_after_consumption / capacity)
  new_stock = min(capacity, stock_after_consumption + growth)

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) if current stock is above a threshold (Tc) and all opponents cooperated in the previous round.
   - Defect (D) if current stock is above Td or at least one opponent defected in the previous round.
   - Use a forgiving mechanism, resetting the memory of opponents' actions after every k rounds (forgiveness factor).

Pseudocode:

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, all players initially cooperate (no history).
   - In the last round, use decision rules as normal since the game will be repeated in future tournaments.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATfT strategy is designed to promote cooperation when opponents are cooperating and punish defection, fostering a long-term collective mindset by rewarding mutual cooperation.
   - The forgiving mechanism allows for learning from past mistakes and encourages opponents to return to cooperation after being defected upon.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) on the first round to show goodwill and trust the other players.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the action of the most cooperative player in the previous round (highest number of C actions). If there's a tie or everyone defected (D), use the 'default strategy': cooperate with probability p_coop and defect otherwise.

               return D
       else:

   ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round (r), as there's no future interaction, cooperate only if the most cooperative player in the previous round also cooperated last round.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATFT strategy emphasizes reciprocity and trust by initially cooperating and mimicking the behavior of the most cooperative player from the previous round. This encourages long-term cooperation while still being able to respond to defection or lack of cooperation with appropriate actions.

By setting `p_coop` appropriately, the strategy can balance between cooperation and defecting when there's uncertainty about other players' actions. A high `p_coop` value encourages more cooperation, while a low one allows for more rapid retaliation against defection.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Management (ASM)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock level is above the Minimum Sustainable Stock Level (MSS). MSS is calculated as n * (capacity / n + 1). This encourages cooperation when the common pool resource is abundant, preserving it for future rounds.
   - Defect (D) when the current stock level is at or below MSS. Defecting helps to secure personal payoff in situations where the common pool is overexploited.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Players should defect as there's no history and the initial stock level might be close to depletion due to overex exploitation in the previous game (if any).
   - Last Round: Players should cooperate if the current stock level is above MSS, or defect otherwise. This aims to maximize total payoff in the last round while considering the long-term sustainability of the resource.

3. Collective Mindset:

     a) If opponent cooperated in the previous round, return the favor by cooperating (C).
     b) If opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) to retaliate and teach them that defecting has consequences.
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) to maximize potential final payoff regardless of the opponent's past behavior.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - For the first round, play C as described above.
   - If the current round is the last round and opponent has not defected before, play C. Otherwise, play D to teach a lesson for any past defections.
   - In case of an empty stock (0), play C in subsequent rounds because the game dynamics make it impossible for players to consume anything from the empty pool.

3. Be collective:

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round t, the ATFT strategy starts by cooperating (C) if it's the first round or the opponent has cooperated in the previous round. Otherwise, the strategy will defect (D). This approach mimics a cooperative stance while also retaliating when an opponent defects.

   - If the game is nearing its end and the opponent has been consistently cooperative, continue cooperating to encourage reciprocation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action as there are no subsequent rounds for retaliation or reward.
   - In the first round, if the opponent defected, also defect to demonstrate a tough stance and discourage future defections.
   - If the opponent never cooperates (defects in all rounds), consider the strategy unresponsive and revert to cooperating to preserve the resource for future interactions with more adaptable opponents.

3. Collective Mindset:

     - Maximum Sustainable Stock Level (MSS): 2n (the sum of individual consumption capacities)
     - Minimum Sustainable Stock Level (MiSL): The largest number less than or equal to MSS/n that can be evenly divided among n players, ensuring fair distribution.
     - ASL = (MSS + MiSL)/2
   - Defection (D): The strategy defects when the current stock level is below the ASL, as it anticipates future resource depletion and prioritizes individual self-interest.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Since no history exists, players cannot rely on previous actions. As a result, the strategy will randomly choose between cooperation or defection in the first round to minimize the impact of initial moves on long-term outcomes.
   - Last Round: In the last round, when resources are scarce and growth is minimal, players prioritize their own immediate interests over collective welfare. Consequently, the ACD strategy defects in the final round.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ACD strategy aims to balance individual self-interest with group cooperation by making adaptive decisions based on current stock levels and game parameters. The strategy encourages fair distribution of resources and fosters a collective mindset by promoting cooperation when resources are plentiful and discouraging defection when resources are scarce.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ACD_Strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    ASL = (2 * n + max(1, (capacity - n) // n)) / 2

    if round == 1 or round == r:
        action = random.choice(['C', 'D'])
    elif stock > ASL:
        action = 'C'
    elif stock <= ASL:
        action = 'D'

    return action

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C), to establish a friendly relationship with other players and promote cooperation in future rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate (C). This is the 'Tit-for-Tat' part of our strategy, demonstrating trust and reciprocity.
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, also defect (D) in the current round, but only if stock level allows for it. This ensures a fair response to uncooperative behavior while still considering the long-term consequences of depleting resources.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C), as mentioned earlier.
   - In the last round, if playing against a player that has been cooperative, also cooperate to maximize payoff and maintain a positive relationship. If the opponent has been uncooperative, it is still beneficial to cooperate when possible, but prioritize not overexploiting resources at the expense of future rounds (i.e., if stock allows for it).
   - In other edge cases where players join or leave the game in between rounds, apply the same decision rules as described above based on the history with that specific opponent.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Pursue long-term sustainable resource management by prioritizing actions that maintain a reasonable stock level for all players (i.e., not depleting resources too quickly). This promotes a sense of community and encourages cooperation among players.
   - Adapt to the behavior of opponents, fostering an environment where players can learn from each other's strategies and possibly develop more cooperative relationships over time.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(opponent_history, n, capacity, stock, r):
    if round == 1:
        action = "C" (Cooperate)
    else:
        if opponent_history[round-1] == "C":
            action = "C" (Cooperate)
        elif stock > (2n * opponent_consumption):
            action = "D" (Defect)
        else:
            action = "C" (Cooperate but don't deplete resources)
    return action

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, assess the average consumption of other players over the last 'p' rounds (where p is a predefined constant). If this average consumption is less than or equal to (capacity / 2n), cooperate; otherwise defect. This promotes cooperation when others also cooperate but retaliates with defection if others are consuming excessively.
   - To encourage the initial formation of mutual cooperation, in the first round, cooperate regardless of other players' actions.
   - In the last round, cooperate if overall average consumption during the game is less than or equal to (capacity / 2n); otherwise defect, ensuring resources are preserved for future rounds if cooperation has been scarce.

Pseudocode:
```python
def A_TFT(player_index, current_round, p, r, stock, capacity):
    average_consumption = sum(stock[current_round-p+1:current_round] / (2*n)) if current_round > p else 0

    if current_round == 1 or current_round == r:
        return 'C' if average_consumption <= capacity / (2*n) else 'D'
    elif average_consumption <= capacity / (2*n):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, the strategy cooperates unconditionally.
   - In the last round, it cooperates if overall average consumption is below the capacity limit; otherwise defects to conserve resources for future games.

3. Being Collective:
   The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT) strategy aligns with a collective mindset by promoting cooperation when others also cooperate but retaliating against excessive consumption. It encourages the formation of mutual cooperation in the initial stages of the game and strives to preserve resources for future rounds if cooperation has been scarce.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Stock Awareness (TFT-ASA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), play Cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows for the common pool resource to grow, ensuring survival in subsequent rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds (t > 1):
      - If the current stock level is below the minimum sustainable level (i.e., 2n), play Defect (D) to prevent potential collapse of the resource. This represents a self-preservation response.
      - Else, if the player's average consumption per round over the last 'm' rounds exceeds the average sustainable consumption per round (i.e., (2n)/r), play Defect (D). This is an adaptive response to free-riders and exploitative players.
      - Otherwise, play Cooperate (C) to maintain a cooperative relationship and support the sustainability of the common pool resource.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): If the current stock level is above the minimum sustainable level, play Cooperate (C) regardless of past behaviour, as there will be no future rounds to consider.
   - First Round (t=1) and Unknown Past Behaviour: Play Cooperate (C), establishing a cooperative tone.

3. Being Collective:
   - Prioritize the collective mindset by emphasizing cooperation whenever possible and practical, while adapting to counter exploitative strategies through stock-awareness and average consumption monitoring.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_ASA(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  m = floor(r / 10)  # window size for average consumption calculation

  # Initial round check

  # Calculate average consumption
  avg_consumption = sum(history[-m:]) / m

  # Check if average consumption exceeds sustainable rate
  if avg_consumption > (2*n)/r:
    return 'D'  # Defect if average consumption is excessive

  # Stock level check

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peaceful initiation, providing a fair chance for all players to build trust.
   - For subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's actions from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if they defected, defect. This rule encourages cooperation and punishes defection.
   - If an opponent switches from cooperation to defection (defection after a string of cooperative actions), there will be a forgiving phase, where the strategy will continue cooperating for a predefined number of rounds before mirroring again.
   - In the last round, cooperate, regardless of the opponent's previous action. This final act of cooperation may help to salvage some stock for future games or signal goodwill towards opponents.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If an opponent starts with defection (D), the strategy will wait for a predefined number of forgiving rounds before mirroring their actions. During this period, the strategy continues cooperating to allow for potential changes in opponent behavior.
   - If the stock level falls below 2n during any round, the strategy switches to prioritizing the survival of the common pool resource and will only choose C if possible (to minimize consumption).

3. Be collective:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy is designed with a collective mindset in mind. It aims at fostering cooperation among players while punishing defection to maintain the common pool resource for future generations.

           if action_i[T-1] == D and action_opponent[T-1] == C then action_i[t] == D

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round (r): Consider the impact of stock growth on future rounds if the game is repeated.
     if t==r then
       if stock >= capacity/2 then action_i[t] == C (to maintain enough resources for future games)
       else action_i[t] == D (as resources are critically low to continue cooperating)

3. Be collective: Align with the collective mindset by promoting cooperation and maintaining a forgiving approach while also punishing defection when necessary, encouraging long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

This strategy attempts to balance short-term gains and long-term resource conservation by considering both current actions and the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds. The SG-ATFT strategy fosters a cooperative environment while being robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors, making it suitable for tournament participation against other AI systems' strategies.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round i, if the stock level is above 2n/3 * capacity, cooperate (C). This ensures that the resource isn't depleted too quickly and allows for sustainable consumption.
   - If the stock level is between 2n/3 * capacity and n * capacity, play the same action as the previous round (i-1). This is based on the principle of reciprocity, rewarding cooperation and punishing defection from the previous round.
   - If the stock level is below n * capacity, defect (D) to ensure survival as the common pool resource is at a critical state.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate since the initial stock level is at its maximum. This demonstrates goodwill and allows for potential future cooperation.
   - In the last round, play the same action as the previous round (i-1), considering that the total game payoff depends on accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy aims to maintain a balance between self-interest and cooperation while being robust against various opponent behaviors. By adopting reciprocity, it encourages a collective mindset by rewarding cooperative actions and punishing defection, thus fostering sustainable resource management.

 For this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a robust and adaptive collective strategy called "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Awareness" (ATfT-SGA). This strategy seeks to balance cooperation and defection based on game parameters, state, and history, while promoting a collaborative mindset.

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round (initiate with goodwill)
   - In subsequent rounds, follow these rules:
     - If all players cooperated last round, cooperate this round (reward cooperation)
     - If at least one player defected last round and stock level is above 50% of capacity, cooperate this round (hope for continued cooperation)
     - If at least one player defected last round and stock level is below 50% of capacity, defect this round (punish defection to preserve resources)

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT-SGA(round, stock, history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    last_action = history[-1]
    if last_action['all'] == 'C':

        return 'C'
    else:

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the previous actions since there is no more growth or consumption in subsequent rounds.

3. Be Collective:
   - By initiating with cooperation and rewarding good behavior, this strategy encourages collaboration among players.
   - The stock growth awareness ensures that the strategy understands the long-term consequences of its actions on the shared resource.

description_COLLECTIVE_54 = '''
 For the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy called Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT). This strategy aims to foster cooperation while being robust against various opponent behaviors.

1. Decision Rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round (C), as it benefits everyone and encourages future cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the actions of other players in the previous round:
     a) If all players cooperated, continue cooperating.
     b) If some players defected but the overall stock level is above a threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), continue cooperating to help restore the stock level.
     c) If the overall stock level dropped significantly (e.g., less than 50% of capacity), defect in the next round to conserve resources and signal displeasure.
     d) If one or more players have consistently defected, mimic their behavior while maintaining a chance for forgiveness after a certain number of rounds (e.g., every 10 rounds).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds for payback, cooperate regardless of previous actions to maximize potential payoff.
   - If the stock level reaches zero, defect indefinitely until the stock recovers or the game ends (since further depletion would result in a zero payoff).

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy prioritizes cooperation to preserve the common resource and promote a collective mindset among players.
   - By being adaptive, it also allows for flexibility in response to opponents' strategies without relying on predetermined patterns or coordination mechanisms.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFT(n, capacity, stock, r, round, history):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'
  else:
    total_players_cooperated = sum(history[-round] == 'C')
    if total_players_cooperated == n and stock >= 0.75 * capacity:
      action = 'C'
    elif stock < 0.5 * capacity:
      action = 'D'
    else:
      action = history[-round]

  return action
```

In this pseudocode, `history` is a list containing the actions of all players in each round (in reverse chronological order). The threshold values for stock levels are arbitrary and can be adjusted based on experimental results.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peaceful gesture that might encourage others to cooperate as well.
   - For subsequent rounds, copy the previous opponent's action from the last round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if not, defect. This tit-for-tat approach encourages reciprocity and cooperation while also punishing defection.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no future interactions, cooperate as a final goodwill gesture.
   - If an opponent never cooperates (defects every time), continue defecting to protect against further stock depletion.
   - If an opponent switches from defection to cooperation at some point, start cooperating again in the next round as a response.

3. Be collective:
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy emphasizes long-term sustainability and cooperation while also being responsive to others' actions. It encourages the formation of a stable community that benefits from mutual cooperation. By punishing defection, it discourages free riders and fosters a collective mindset in which each player recognizes the importance of preserving resources for future rounds.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tit_for_tat(player_index, opponent_history, round, r, history):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Forgiveness (TFT-AF)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round and when stock > 0, always cooperate (C). This signals a willingness to form a cooperative relationship and demonstrates trust towards other players.
   - For subsequent rounds, follow the Tit-for-Tat strategy: if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate with cooperation; if they defected, also defect.
   - Introduce Adaptive Forgiveness to encourage a return to cooperation after periods of conflict or mistakes:
     - If the opponent has defected in the last two rounds and then cooperates, forgive them and cooperate yourself. This mechanism allows for forgiveness and fosters an environment where past missteps can be forgotten and relationships rebuilt.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff by defecting regardless of opponent's previous actions.
   - If the stock is depleted (0), all players should defect to avoid starvation, as there will be no growth in the next round.
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier, even if opponents do not cooperate since it signals a willingness to form a cooperative relationship.

3. Being Collective:
   - Align with the collective mindset by prioritizing long-term cooperation, which benefits all players and promotes sustainable resource management.
   - The TFT-AF strategy encourages mutual trust and punishes defection, fostering an environment where players can work together towards a common goal of maximizing overall payoff while ensuring the resource lasts for future rounds.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation-Defection Strategy (ACDS)

1. Decision Rules:
   ACDS chooses between cooperation (C) and defection (D) based on a combination of current stock level and past game history. The strategy aims to strike a balance between immediate gain and long-term sustainability.

   - If the current stock is below a predefined threshold (T_c), ACDS defects, prioritizing individual payoff over resource conservation (D).
   ```
   if stock < T_c:
       action = "D"
   ```

   - If the current stock is above T_c and the cumulative consumption in the last M rounds exceeded a threshold (T_d), ACDS cooperates, aiming to reduce the overall depletion of resources (C).
   ```
   if stock > T_c and total_consumption_last_M_rounds > T_d:
       action = "C"
   ```

   - If neither condition above is met, ACDS randomly chooses between cooperation and defection with a bias towards cooperation. This encourages collaboration when the game state seems stable but also allows for defection if there are signs of excessive resource depletion (mild cooperation).
   ```
   else:
       random_chance = uniform(0, 1)
       if random_chance < p:
           action = "C"
       else:
           action = "D"
   ```
   Here, `p` is a parameter controlling the bias towards cooperation.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: ACDS chooses randomly with a higher probability of cooperation to foster initial collaboration (initial cooperation bias).
   ```
   if round == 1:
       random_chance = uniform(0, 1)
       if random_chance < p_init:
           action = "C"
       else:
           action = "D"
   ```
   Here, `p_init` is a parameter controlling the initial cooperation bias.

   - Last Round: ACDS prioritizes immediate gain over long-term sustainability to maximize total payoff across all rounds (last round greed).
   ```
   if round == r:
       action = "D"
   ```

3. Be Collective:
   - By favoring cooperation when resource depletion is low and the cumulative consumption over a specified number of rounds exceeds a threshold, ACDS aims to maintain a balanced common pool for sustainable long-term gameplay.
   - Randomly choosing between cooperation and defection with a bias towards cooperation encourages collaboration while allowing for flexibility in various opponent behaviors.
   - The initial cooperation bias helps foster an environment for collective action at the start of the game.
   - Last round greed ensures ACDS maximizes its total payoff across all rounds, striking a balance between individual and collective interests.

     a) If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (C).
     b) If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (D). This is a punishment for defection.
   - The strategy encourages cooperation as long as opponents are cooperative but retaliates against defection to promote reciprocity.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, prioritize a higher payoff regardless of opponent's actions. Analyze the accumulated stock and act accordingly:
     a) If the accumulated stock is low (below 50% of capacity), defect to secure as much as possible from the remaining resources (D).
     b) If the accumulated stock is high (above 50% of capacity), cooperate to maintain a higher potential for future rounds and growth (C).
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C) since it sets the tone for the game.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Gradual Cooperation (ATTCG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate a cooperative intent. This initial cooperation might encourage others to reciprocate in subsequent rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, adopt the Tit-for-Tat strategy by cooperating if the opponent cooperated in the previous round and defecting if the opponent defected.
   - Introduce a gradual adaptation element to account for slow-learning or non-cooperative opponents:
     - If an opponent has been consistently cooperative (e.g., cooperation rate ≥ 80%), maintain cooperative behavior.
     - If an opponent has been consistently defective (e.g., defection rate ≥ 80%), also defect to preserve the common pool resource for future potential cooperation.
     - For opponents that have displayed a mixed or unpredictable strategy, gradually shift towards cooperation to allow for the possibility of reciprocity and growth in the common pool stock. This can be done by introducing a factor 'F' representing forgiveness, where F < 1:
       - If opponent cooperated last round, cooperate with probability F; otherwise defect.
   - In the final round, switch to the most beneficial action (cooperation or defection) based on the current stock level and number of remaining players:
     - If stock is low, defect to preserve the resource for future rounds.
     - If stock is high, cooperate to allow other players an opportunity to collect a larger payoff in the final round.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round (t = 1), cooperate as mentioned above.
   - In the last round (t = r), switch to the most beneficial action based on current stock and players' number, as described earlier.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATTCG strategy prioritizes collective resource preservation over individual gains by gradually shifting towards cooperation, allowing for potential reciprocity from opponents.
   - By adapting to opponents' behavior, the strategy fosters a sense of collaboration and demonstrates willingness to build and maintain social norms.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-Based Tit-for-Tat (AFB-TFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C). This gesture sets a positive tone and allows for potential cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - For each subsequent round t (t > 1), evaluate the average payoff of the opponent from the last three rounds:
     - If the average payoff is greater than or equal to 0.75, cooperate (C). This means that the opponent has been relatively fair and cooperative in recent rounds, so it's beneficial to reciprocate.
     - If the average payoff is less than 0.75 and the current stock level is below a certain threshold (e.g., 80% of the capacity), defect (D). The opponent has been selfish and hoarding resources may lead to potential shortages that could harm our future performance.
     - Otherwise, if neither condition above is met, cooperate (C). This means that the opponent has been slightly uncooperative but not excessively so, and it's still beneficial to reciprocate with cooperation in hopes of encouraging future fairness.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C). See point 1 for details.
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing our own payoff: if our current payoff is less than or equal to the average payoff of the opponent from the previous three rounds, defect (D). This ensures that we don't leave any valuable resources unclaimed if the opponent has been significantly more cooperative.
   - For other edge cases such as when the game reaches a critical stock level or specific round numbers, our strategy can be designed to take these factors into account by adjusting the cooperation threshold mentioned in point 1 accordingly.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Our strategy encourages cooperation among players, reciprocating fair behavior and discouraging excessive hoarding of resources. By promoting a balance between self-interest and group wellbeing, our AFB-TFT strategy aims to establish a stable, cooperative environment that benefits all participants in the long run.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative environment and demonstrate goodwill.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round: if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This encourages reciprocity and builds trust when playing against cooperative opponents.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, as mentioned above, cooperate.
   - In the last round, cooperate to avoid leaving the opponent with a disadvantageous state for the next game. However, this might be overridden by the adaptive rule if the opponent defected in the previous round.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:
   - The strategy aims to maintain a healthy common pool stock level while maximizing individual payoff, thereby supporting the overall well-being of the community.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATfT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  # First round, cooperate
  if round == 1:
    return "C"

  # Last round, cooperate unless opponent defected last time
  if round == r and history[-1] == "D":
    return "D"

  # Mimic opponent's action from the previous round
  return history[-1]
```

description_COLLECTIVE_62 = '''
 For this Common Pool Resource Game, we'll design a robust and adaptive strategy called the Tit-for-Tat (TFT) approach with an added element of forgiveness to promote cooperation. The TFT strategy is widely recognized in game theory for its simplicity, fairness, and success in repeated prisoner's dilemma scenarios.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate on the first round (to initiate cooperation)
   - On subsequent rounds, copy the opponent's action from the previous round
     (TFT encourages cooperation when opponents are cooperative and punishes defection)
   - Forgiveness: If an opponent has previously defected but switched back to cooperate, follow their lead by cooperating in the current round

Pseudocode for TFT strategy:
```python
def tit_for_tat(opponent_history):
    if round == 1:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate on first round
    else:
        last_round_action = opponent_history[-1]
        if last_round_action == "D":  # If opponent defected, they need to ask for forgiveness
            forgiveness_counter = min(3, len(opponent_history) - 1)  # Allow up to 3 recent defections before considering forgiveness
            if opponent_history[-forgiveness_counter-1] == "C":  # If the opponent was cooperative before, forgive them and cooperate
                action = "C"
            else:  # If the opponent wasn't cooperative before, stick to the last action
                action = last_round_action
        else:  # If the opponent cooperated last round, copy their action
            action = last_round_action
    return action
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: No need for consideration as there will be no subsequent rounds
   - The strategy starts by assuming all opponents are cooperative (initially no history available)

3. Be collective: By promoting cooperation, the TFT approach encourages a collective mindset of sharing and sustaining the common pool resource, incentivizing long-term success for all players.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Evolutionary Strategy (TFTES) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The TFTES strategy is based on the well-known Tit-for-Tat (TFT) strategy from game theory, adapted to suit the Common Pool Resource Game. In each round:
- If the current stock level allows for both C and D actions to result in a positive payoff, cooperate (C). This ensures that players do not deplete the common pool too quickly, promoting conservation.
- If the current stock level allows only for the D action to result in a positive payoff, defect (D). This enables players to secure their share when necessary.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFTES(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
 if (round == 1) then
   return 'C' if stock >= capacity / (2n)
   else return 'D'
 endif

 consumption_threshold = capacity / n
 if (stock < consumption_threshold * (n - 1)) then
   return 'C'
 else if (stock >= consumption_threshold * n) then
   return 'D'
 else
   return opponent's last action in previous round
 endif
end function
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

The strategy behaves differently in the first round to ensure fairness and avoid penalizing cooperative opponents from the start. In the last round, players might not need to be as conservative because there are no more rounds after this.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFTES(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
 if (round == 1) then
   return 'C' if stock >= capacity / (2n)
   else return 'D'
 endif

 if (round < r) then
   consumption_threshold = capacity / n
   if (stock < consumption_threshold * (n - 1)) then
       return 'C'
   else if (stock >= consumption_threshold * n) then
       return 'D'
   else
       return opponent's last action in previous round
   endif
 endif

 if (round == r) then
   if (stock > 0) then
       return 'C'
   else
       return opponent's last action in previous round
   endif
end function
```

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

The TFTES strategy encourages cooperation by avoiding unnecessary depletion of the common pool and adapting to the behaviour of other players. By cooperating when possible, this strategy aims to foster a sense of community among players, promoting sustainable use of the shared resource over time.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, compare the opponent's action from the previous round to our own action in the last round. If both actions were Cooperate (C), play C; if either player Defected (D), defect in the current round. This creates a pattern of reciprocity that encourages sustained cooperation when partners cooperate consistently, and retaliates against defection with defection to punish and potentially encourage future cooperation.
   - If the opponent is new or there is no history available (first round), play C initially as a sign of goodwill.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, play C regardless of previous actions since the game ends after this round.
   - If the stock reaches zero (or nearly zero) and growth becomes insignificant, alter the TFT-A strategy to focus on sustaining the common resource rather than strictly adhering to reciprocity. In such a case, play C if the opponent played C in the previous round and D otherwise. This ensures that some stock remains for future rounds while still punishing defection when necessary.

3. Be collective:
   - The TFT-A strategy promotes cooperation as it rewards consistent cooperation and punishes defection. By reciprocating an opponent's actions, the strategy aligns with a collective mindset that values fairness and long-term sustainability of the common resource.

Pseudocode for TFT-A strategy:
```
function TFT_A(opponentHistory, currentState, gameParameters, roundNumber) {
  if (roundNumber == 1) {
    return "C"; // Cooperate in the first round as a sign of goodwill
  }

  opponentAction = opponentHistory[roundNumber - 1];
  previousPlayerAction = myHistory[roundNumber - 1];

  if (previousPlayerAction == "C" && opponentAction == "C") {
    return "C"; // Cooperate when both players cooperated in the previous round
  } else {
    return "D"; // Defect when either player defected in the previous round or there was no history available
  }
}
```
In this pseudocode, `myHistory` is a record of our own past actions, and `opponentHistory` is a record of the opponent's past actions. The function takes these histories, the current game state, and game parameters as input to determine the action for the given round number.

description_COLLECTIVE_65 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Optimization (ASO) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, calculate the average consumption per player (avg_consumption = total_consumption / n).
   - If avg_consumption < capacity / (2n), cooperate (play C). This decision aims to maintain a sustainable stock level while avoiding overconsumption.
   - If avg_consumption ≥ capacity / (2n) and the new stock after consumption would be less than the current stock, defect (play D). This decision helps conserve the remaining stock when consumption seems excessive.
   - Otherwise, if both conditions are not met, make a random choice between cooperate (C) and defect (D).

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, since there is no history or previous state to consider, start by playing C. This decision helps build trust and encourages cooperation in the initial stages of the game.
   - In the last round, if the stock level is insufficient for all players (stock < n), defect (play D). In this case, there is no point in further depleting the remaining resources. If the stock is sufficient, play according to the decision rules mentioned earlier.
   - For any other edge cases or ambiguities, prioritize actions that lead to a higher average payoff and maintain the sustainability of the common pool resource.

3. Being Collective:
   - The ASO strategy emphasizes a balance between self-interest and collective interest by considering both the overall health of the shared resource and each player's individual rewards. By adhering to the decision rules, players can foster cooperation and sustain the common pool resource for future rounds.

Pseudocode:
```
function ASO(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if round = 1:
    play C
  else:
    avg_consumption = total_consumption / n
    if avg_consumption < capacity / (2n) and stock >= n:
      play C
    elif avg_consumption >= capacity / (2n) and stock + growth < stock:
      play D
    else:
      random choice between C and D
  end if

description_COLLECTIVE_66 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peaceful overture to establish a positive relationship.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's actions from the previous round and respond accordingly:
      - If the opponent cooperated in the last round, also cooperate in the current round. This reinforces mutual cooperation.
      - If the opponent defected in the last round, defect in the current round. This punishes the opponent for their previous defection.
   - To encourage cooperation from opponents, always revert to cooperating after having defected previously three times consecutively (this is known as forgiveness).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, regardless of the previous opponent's action, cooperate because the game will end soon and there are no further opportunities for retaliation or reciprocity.
   - If the current stock level is zero, defect because it is impossible to consume any more resources from an empty pool. This ensures that the strategy does not contribute to overconsumption.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATfT strategy fosters a collective mindset by promoting mutual cooperation in response to cooperative behavior and enforcing consequences for defection through punitive actions.
   - By relying on historical information about opponent's actions, the strategy demonstrates responsiveness to changes in the other players' strategies over time.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATfT(round_num, opponent_history):
    if round_num == 1:
        return 'C' # Cooperate in the first round

    cooperation_count = len([action for action in opponent_history if action == 'C'])
    defection_count = len(opponent_history) - cooperation_count

    if defection_count > 3:
        return 'C' # Forgiveness after three consecutive defections
    elif cooperation_count == len(opponent_history):
        return 'C' # Cooperate when opponent has always cooperated
    else:
        return 'D' # Defect when opponent has ever defected or not yet cooperated
```

description_COLLECTIVE_67 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (ATFSG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average consumption per player over the previous r-1 rounds and compare it to the optimal average consumption for perfect cooperation (capacity / (2n)). If the current round's average consumption is lower than or equal to the optimum, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This ensures that the strategy follows a cooperative approach unless provoked by excessive depletion of resources.
   - To adapt to different opponent behaviors and incentivize cooperation, mimic opponents who have been consistently cooperative while retaliating against those who have been too aggressive. If an opponent has cooperated in more than (n-1) out of the last r rounds, the ATFSG will cooperate; otherwise, it will defect.
   - If an opponent has switched from cooperation to defection or vice versa between two consecutive rounds, ATFSG will cooperate on the next round, promoting the possibility of reconciliation and encouraging a more stable relationship.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, since there is no history, ATFSG will defect to avoid being exploited by overly aggressive opponents.
   - During the last round, ATFSG will cooperate if the average consumption is within the cooperative threshold; otherwise, it will defect, depending on the opponent's behavior throughout the game. This encourages other players to conserve resources and secure a higher payoff for both parties in the final round.
   - If an opponent switches strategy during the game (e.g., from Tit-for-Tat to All-Defect), ATFSG will adjust its response accordingly, adopting a more cooperative or aggressive stance based on the new pattern observed.

3. Being Collective:
   - ATFSG aims at maintaining a sustainable and stable environment for all players, ensuring that resource depletion is kept to a minimum while promoting cooperation whenever possible. By following this strategy, each player can maximize their individual payoff while contributing to the collective welfare of all participants in the game.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFSG(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  average_consumption = sum([consumption for t in range(1, r) if history[t-1] == 'C'] / (r - 1)

  if r == 1:
    return 'D'  # defect in the first round

  if average_consumption <= capacity / (2 * n):
    return 'C'  # cooperate if average consumption is within the cooperative threshold
  else:
    if history[-r] == 'C':
      return 'C'  # mimic opponents who have been consistently cooperative
    else:
      return 'D'  # defect against aggressive opponents

  if r == game_rounds and average_consumption > capacity / (2 * n):
    return 'D'  # defect in the last round if resource depletion is excessive
```

description_COLLECTIVE_68 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate to show good intentions and encourage cooperation. This is known as "initial kindness".
   - In subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back. If the opponent defected, also defect in the same round to reciprocate the action.
   - The strategy will gradually adapt towards more cooperation if it encounters a series of cooperative actions from opponents, and vice versa, it may become less forgiving over time when encountering repeated defections.
   - To implement adaptation, a memory mechanism stores the history of interactions with each opponent. If an opponent's behavior remains cooperative for t consecutive rounds, the ATFT strategy becomes increasingly cooperative by reducing the threshold (t) for returning cooperation. Conversely, if an opponent defects repeatedly, the threshold (t) for cooperation grows, making it less likely to return cooperation in future interactions.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - If it's the last round (r = current round), use the current history and memory mechanism to decide the action based on the opponent's behavior during the game. A more cooperative history may lead to cooperation in the final round to show goodwill and potentially influence future interactions, while a less cooperative history may encourage defection.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - ATFT strategy prioritizes maintaining a sustainable common pool resource by considering long-term payoffs and avoiding excessive consumption. It promotes cooperation and encourages opponents to follow a similar approach, aiming for mutual benefit in repeated interactions over multiple rounds.
   - The adaptive nature of the strategy allows it to adjust its behavior depending on opponent strategies, which could lead to emergent coordination and collaboration when facing compatible opponents. However, it does not rely on specific coordination mechanisms or shared norms, ensuring robustness against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Adaptation (TFT-SGA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C), to promote cooperation and avoid immediately depleting the resource.
   - For subsequent rounds, adopt a "Tit for Tat" approach:
      if opponent cooperated in the previous round, then cooperate (C); otherwise defect (D).
      This rule encourages reciprocity, which is crucial for long-term cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff regardless of past actions due to limited opportunities in future rounds. If stock > 0, defect (D); otherwise cooperate (C).
   - When the stock is depleted (stock = 0), the game restarts with the initial capacity, and players should follow the decision rule again.
   - In cases where the stock growth calculation leads to a negative number, set it as zero to ensure that the new stock remains within the given capacity limits.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy encourages long-term cooperation while also allowing for punishment when necessary, fostering a balance between individual and collective interests.

Pseudocode:

   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and encourages trust among players.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the action of the opponent from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect. This simple rule maintains consistency while allowing for some forgiveness if an opponent temporarily deviates from cooperation.
   - In the last round, cooperate to potentially maximize payoff and show goodwill.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If an opponent plays a mixed strategy (combination of C and D), choose an action based on the majority of their previous actions.
   - In the case where an opponent has not played any rounds, start cooperating to give them the opportunity to follow TFT.

3. Be collective:
   - The main goal is to maintain a sustainable stock level for long-term success. By following the TFT rule and adapting to opponents' actions, this strategy promotes cooperation while ensuring that it does not continue indefinitely with partners who repeatedly defect.

If opponent defected (D), also defect (D) to punish uncooperative behavior but then switch back to cooperating (C) in the following round as a gesture of goodwill and opportunity for reconciliation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, if the stock is depleted, cooperate since there are no further rounds and no benefit can be gained from punishment. If the stock is not depleted, use the standard A-TFT decision rules.
   - In the case of a tie (same number of players playing C and D), follow the majority rule: if more than half of the players cooperated in the previous round, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - If the stock is zero before the first round, set it to the initial capacity and cooperate in the first round.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Preservation (ASP) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperation (C): Choose C when the current stock level S is greater than or equal to a threshold T_c, defined as (n/2 + 1)*capacity. The idea is to conserve resources when there's an abundance.
   - Defection (D): Choose D otherwise (S < T_c). This encourages players to take more when the common pool is depleted.

Pseudocode:
```
def decideAction(n, capacity, S):
  if S >= (n/2 + 1)*capacity:
    return "C"  # Cooperate
  else:
    return "D"  # Defect
```

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Since the initial stock is capacity, players should choose to conserve and cooperate (S >= T_c).
   - Last Round: In the final round, players should consider their total payoffs from previous rounds along with the current state (stock level) to make a decision. If the stock level is high enough, they may still cooperate to ensure resource preservation for future games if applicable.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ASP strategy aims to strike a balance between conservation and self-interest by focusing on maintaining a sustainable common pool for all players over multiple rounds. It allows for adaptability in various scenarios, encouraging cooperation when resources are abundant and defection when they're scarce.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C), establishing a cooperative first impression. This approach is similar to the original Tit-for-Tat strategy in the Prisoner's Dilemma game, but here we emphasize cooperation from the start due to the initial abundance of resources.
   - Subsequent Rounds:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), cooperate (C). This rewards cooperation and encourages continued cooperation from opponents.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round (t-1), defect (D) to penalize defection and encourage future cooperation. In other words, this strategy retaliates against defection but quickly forgives subsequent cooperation.
   - Last Round (t=r): Cooperate (C), as the game ends soon regardless of opponent's actions.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate (C) as mentioned above.
   - Last Round: Cooperate (C) to maximize potential gains from a depleted resource pool, knowing that there are no further rounds.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes the collective interest by maintaining a stable resource level over time through cooperative behavior. If opponents also adopt this strategy, they will form a stable equilibrium with repeated cooperation.
   - In case of conflicting interests, the strategy favors long-term sustainability and resource preservation over immediate gains, which promotes the collective good.

   - Cooperate in the initial round (first mime), to demonstrate goodwill and foster a cooperative environment.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe and mimic the opponent's actions from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect. This ensures reciprocity and stability in the relationship.
   - Introduce forgiveness by re-cooperating after a history of defections (giving the other player a chance to return to cooperation). However, maintain a memory of the opponent's actions and revert to defecting if they continue to defect. This encourages long-term cooperation while penalizing persistent selfishness.
   - Introduce a level of adaptability by periodically testing the opponent's intentions (tit for tat with random deviations). By doing so, TFT-A can identify and respond to changes in the opponent's strategy without relying on communication or coordination.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions, as there are no further opportunities for retaliation or reciprocity.
   - If the current stock level drops below 2n in any round, defect to prevent the complete depletion of resources, prioritizing long-term survival and sustainability.

3. Be collective:
   - TFT-A's decision rules focus on promoting cooperation and mutual benefits while considering the common pool resource constraints.
   - By mimicking opponent actions and fostering a reciprocal relationship, TFT-A encourages collective mindset by encouraging cooperative behavior over self-interested actions that may harm the shared resources.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate initially (first round): ATfT starts with a cooperative gesture to foster cooperation and goodwill among opponents. This mimics the "nice" strategy in Prisoner's Dilemma games.
   - Mirror opponent's actions from previous round: If an opponent cooperated in the last round, ATfT will cooperate; if an opponent defected, ATfT will also defect. This encourages reciprocity and punishes defection.
   - Forgiveness after long strings of cooperation: After a string of successful cooperative rounds (e.g., m consecutive cooperations), ATfT forgives past transgressions and returns to cooperating even if the opponent defected in the previous round. This reduces unnecessary punishment and encourages the continuation of cooperative relationships.
   - Adaptive forgiveness frequency 'm': The length of the forgiveness window, m, can be adjusted adaptively over time based on the average level of cooperation observed from the opponents during a specified window (e.g., past k rounds). A higher average cooperation level may result in a shorter forgiveness window and vice versa.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last round: ATfT cooperates if the current round is not the last one, as future cooperation depends on the opponent's actions in this round. If it's the final round, ATfT will mirror the opponent's action from the previous round to ensure fairness.
   - First round: As mentioned above, ATfT starts by cooperating to encourage reciprocity.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Fostering cooperation: By starting with a cooperative gesture and punishing defection, ATfT encourages cooperation among opponents over time, as it rewards long strings of cooperation while also punishing prolonged defections.
   - Adaptivity: The strategy adjusts its forgiveness frequency based on the average level of cooperation observed from opponents during specified windows to adapt to various opponent behaviours.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATfT(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, history):
    strategy = {'cooperate': C, 'defect': D}
    current_round, forgiveness_window = 1, m_default # default to cooperation and a fixed forgiveness window length
    stock = initial_stock
    opponent_actions = []

    for round in range(r):
        if round == 0: # first round
            action = strategy['cooperate']
        else:
            previous_action = opponent_actions[-1] if len(opponent_actions) > 0 else None
            if current_round >= forgiveness_window and previous_action != 'defect':
                action = strategy['cooperate'] # forgive after long strings of cooperation
            elif len(opponent_actions) > (current_round - m_default) and sum(opponent_actions[-m_default:]) == m_default * strategy['cooperate']:
                action = strategy['cooperate'] # forgive if opponents have been cooperative recently
            else:
                action = strategy[opponent_actions[current_round - 1]] # mirror opponent's previous action

        stock -= actions_consumption[action] # update the current stock level based on the chosen action
        payoff = payoff_function(stock) # calculate payoff for this round
        opponent_actions.append(action) # record the current action for future reference
        current_round += 1

    total_payoff = sum(payoff for payoff in payoffs) # calculate the total payoff over all rounds
    return total_payoff
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Management (ASM)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate when the stock is above the Critical Stock Level (CSL), defined as CSL = (capacity * n) / (2n + 1). This encourages cooperation when the resource pool is abundant, promoting sustainability.
   - Defect when the stock reaches or drops below the Warning Stock Level (WSL), defined as WSL = capacity / n. This triggers defection when the resource pool is critically low to avoid depletion.
   - In all other cases, choose the action that maximizes the expected average payoff per round (EAPP) for the remaining rounds based on historical data. This adaptive behavior allows ASM to learn and adjust its decisions over time.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Choose to defect if the initial stock is lower than WSL, and cooperate otherwise. The idea is to account for the potential scarcity of resources at the beginning of the game.
   - Last Round: If the remaining stock is less than WSL, defect regardless of the current CSL. This ensures ASM does not contribute to overexploitation near the end of the game when resources are already depleted.
   - Other Edge Cases (e.g., rounds where the stock drops below 0): In such cases, the stock will automatically reset to the new stock (min(S_remaining + growth, capacity)) for the following round, ensuring the game continues.

3. Being Collective:
   - ASM maintains a collective mindset by considering the common pool resource and its long-term sustainability in decision-making. The strategy is designed to balance immediate payoff with the preservation of resources for future rounds, promoting collective success over individual gain.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ASM(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  CSL = (capacity * n) / (2n + 1)
  WSL = capacity / n

  if round == 1 and stock < WSL:
    return 'Defect'

  if round == r or stock <= WSL:
    return 'Defect'

  if stock >= CSL:
    return 'Cooperate'

  # Adaptive behavior based on historical data
  EAPP = calculate_EAPP(stock, history)
  if EAPP[0] > EAPP[1]:
    return 'Cooperate'
  else:
    return 'Defect'
```

description_COLLECTIVE_77 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Sharing (ARS)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round i, player calculates average stock level per player (Average_stock = stock / n).
   - If Average_stock > capacity / (2n), the player defects (D), as the current resource level is already unsustainable for all players.
   - Else if Average_stock < capacity / (3n), the player cooperates (C), as there's still a significant amount of resources remaining that could be used wisely.
   - In any other case, the player makes a decision based on the following probability:
     P(C) = min(1, ((Average_stock / capacity) * 2))

2. Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Player employs P(C) regardless of the initial stock level, as no previous data is available for calculations.
   - Last Round: Player chooses to maximize total payoff by always cooperating (C), even if it means depleting the resource completely.

3. Collective Mindset:
   The strategy aims to strike a balance between resource conservation and self-interest, fostering cooperation whenever possible while avoiding overexploitation when resources are scarce. By adapting its behavior based on current conditions, ARS is flexible enough to counter various opponent strategies without relying on specific coordination mechanisms or shared norms.

Pseudocode for Player i:
```python
def play_round(stock, n, capacity):
  Average_stock = stock / n
  if stock <= 0:
    return 'Last Round'
  elif stock >= capacity:
    return 'Initial Round'
  else:
    P(C) = min(1, (Average_stock / capacity) * 2)
    action = 'C' with probability P(C), otherwise 'D'
    return action

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average consumption per player over the last 'k' rounds (a sliding window of length 'k').
   - If the average consumption is less than or equal to (stock / 2n), cooperate (C) to contribute to stock growth and promote cooperation.
   - Otherwise, defect (D) to punish excessive resource exploitation. The punishment is proportionate to the difference between the current average consumption and (stock/2n).

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(n, r, capacity, k, stock, round):
  if round == 1:
    return C # Cooperate in the first round to promote a cooperative environment

  moving_average = calculateMovingAverage(stock, n, k)
  if moving_average <= (stock / 2n):
    return C # Cooperate when average consumption is low
  else:
    punishment = (moving_average - (stock / 2n)) * (stock / (2n * n)) # Calculate the punishment level
    action = D # Defect to punish excessive exploitation

function calculateMovingAverage(stock, n, k):
  total_consumption = sum((i=1 to n) stock_consumed_by_player_i in the last 'k' rounds)
  return total_consumption / (n * k)
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as described above to promote a cooperative environment.
   - In the last round, use the same decision rules but with a shorter sliding window ('k') to account for changing game dynamics towards the end of the game.
   - If 'k' is not provided during initialization, set it to a default value suitable for the given game parameters and rounds count.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy aligns with the collective mindset by promoting cooperation when average consumption levels are low and discouraging excessive exploitation through proportional punishment.
   - By adapting to the current state of resource depletion, it aims to maintain a sustainable stock level for future rounds and ensure overall collective success in the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_79 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, we'll design a strategic approach called Tit-for-Tat (TFT) adapted for our game context. This adaptive and robust strategy is designed to promote cooperation while being responsive to opponent behavior.

1. Decision rules:
   - Initially, cooperate (C) in the first round to show goodwill towards opponents. After that, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round (i.e., if opponent cooperated in the last round, also cooperate; otherwise, defect). This encourages reciprocity and can foster cooperation over time.
   - If the stock is depleted to zero, reset the strategy to initially cooperate in the next round as an attempt to rebuild the common pool.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tit_for_tat(history):
  if len(history) == 0: # first round
    return 'C'

  last_action = history[-1]
  if last_action == 'C': # cooperate if opponent cooperated last time
    return 'C'
  elif last_action == 'D': # defect if opponent defected last time
    return 'D'
  elif stock == 0: # if stock is depleted, restart strategy with cooperation in the next round
    return 'C'
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, there's no need to consider history as there are no more subsequent rounds. Thus, you should cooperate to preserve any remaining common stock for future games if they occur.

3. Be collective:
   - TFT is inherently collectively oriented since it encourages cooperation and reciprocity by mirroring the opponent's actions. It promotes long-term sustainability of the common pool resource game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_80 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Management (ASM)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, ASM calculates the normalized stock level by dividing the current stock with the maximum sustainable capacity. This gives a value between 0 and 1, representing the health of the common pool resource.
   - If the normalized stock is greater than or equal to a predefined threshold (T), ASM cooperates to conserve resources and promote growth for future rounds. The cooperation leads to lower individual payoff but higher overall collective benefit.
   - If the normalized stock is less than T, ASM defects to ensure its own survival, which results in a higher individual payoff but potentially faster depletion of the common pool resource.
   - The threshold T can be adjusted based on the specific game parameters and the history of the game (e.g., the current round number or the average normalized stock level over past rounds). A lower T encourages more cooperation, while a higher T favors more defection.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: ASM defects as it has no knowledge of the resource's health and cannot predict the behavior of other players. This ensures survival in the early stages of the game.
   - Last Round (or when r is reached): ASM cooperates if the normalized stock level is above T, or defects if it is below T. This approach aims to conserve resources whenever possible, even in the final round.
   - In case of ties (i.e., multiple players have the same normalized stock level), ASM uses a random selection mechanism to decide its action, ensuring fairness and avoiding potential conflicts.

3. Being Collective:
   - ASM prioritizes collective survival and resource conservation over immediate individual gain, adjusting its behavior based on the current state of the common pool and the history of past rounds. This mindset encourages cooperation when necessary while remaining adaptable to different opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode for Adaptive Stock Management (ASM):

```
function ASM(n, r, capacity, stock, round_number, T) {
    normalized_stock = stock / capacity;

    if (round_number == 1) {
        return "Defect"; // Survival in the first round
    } else if (round_number == r) {
        if (normalized_stock >= T) {
            return "Cooperate"; // Conservation in the last round or game end
        } else {
            return "Defect"; // Survival in the final stages
        }
    } else {
        if (normalized_stock >= T) {
            return "Cooperate"; // Resource conservation
        } else {
            return "Defect"; // Individual survival

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, play Cooperate (C), setting a cooperative tone and offering potential partners an incentive to reciprocate in future rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's actions from the previous round:
      1. If the opponent Cooperated, continue Cooperating as a positive reinforcement of their cooperation.
      2. If the opponent Defected, Defect in retaliation to punish their uncooperative behavior and encourage them to cooperate in future rounds.
   - Adaptiveness is introduced by gradually reducing the duration of punishment over time, aiming to foster long-term cooperation:
      a. If the opponent has been Defecting for m consecutive rounds, start cooperating again after (m+1) rounds if the opponent cooperates this round.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Play Cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action, as you will not have the opportunity to retaliate or benefit from cooperation in future rounds.
   - Initial Stocks approaching zero (i.e., low resource scarcity): Reduce the duration of punishment by adapting the m value based on the severity of the resource depletion.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Emphasize long-term sustainability and mutual benefit over short-term gains, as cooperation allows for maintaining a higher average stock level and payoff over time compared to defection.
   - Foster reciprocity by responding positively to cooperative actions and punishing uncooperative behavior, encouraging others to follow the same pattern.

Pseudocode:
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a positive tone for future interactions and opens up opportunities for cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round:
     - If opponent cooperated, cooperate (C) in the current round. This rewards cooperation and promotes long-term mutual benefits.
     - If opponent defected, defect (D) in the current round to punish defection and signal dissatisfaction with the previous action.
   - To ensure fairness, after a run of n consecutive cooperations (i.e., the stock level is close to its maximum sustainable level), switch back to cooperation even if the opponent defected in the last round. This allows the stock to grow and provides an opportunity for future cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) as mentioned earlier.
   - If the current round is the last round, cooperate (C) regardless of the opponent's previous action to maintain a positive tone and show goodwill.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The strategy aims for long-term stability and mutual growth within the common pool resource game environment. By encouraging cooperation whenever possible, the ATFT strategy promotes shared benefits among all players while being fair to those who may initially defect.
   - The adaptive nature of this strategy allows it to respond to various opponent behaviors and foster a collective mindset over time as more rounds are played.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFT_strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1: # First round, cooperate

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate to start fresh with a positive stock level and encourage cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds (t > 1), evaluate the opponent's behavior in the previous round:
     - If opponent cooperated (C), reciprocate cooperation by also choosing C in the current round.
     - If opponent defected (D), retaliate by defecting in the current round to punish their action from the previous round. However, if the total stock after consumption falls below a threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity) to ensure survival, cooperate regardless of opponent's action to conserve resources.
     - If the game has reached its last round (t=r), prioritize not letting the common pool deplete completely to leave a sustainable resource for future games. Thus, if the total stock after consumption falls below 80% of capacity, cooperate regardless of opponent's action in the current round.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: Strategy cooperates to start fresh with a positive stock level and encourage cooperation.
   - Last round: If the total stock after consumption falls below 80% of capacity, strategy will prioritize not letting the common pool deplete completely to leave a sustainable resource for future games.

3. Be collective: Strategy aims to maintain a stable and sustainable stock level that benefits all players in the long run by encouraging cooperation while punishing defection when necessary. The strategy is adaptive to a wide range of opponent behaviors and promotes a collective mindset through reciprocation and survival-oriented decisions.

   - From round 2 to penultimate round (t=2 to r-1), imitate the behavior of the most frequent collaborator in the previous round. If multiple players have the same frequency, mimic the player who has been cooperating longest. If there's a tie in both aspects, continue cooperating as in the first round.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as described above.
   - If there are no collaborative players in the previous round (i.e., all players defected), continue cooperating since it's the initial state of the game and it may incentivize others to change their behavior.
   - If a player has never collaborated throughout the game, ignore that player when determining the most collaborative player.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes maintaining a sustainable common pool resource for long-term benefits. It encourages cooperation and retaliates against defection to promote mutual understanding and trust among players. The strategy is also adaptive, as it learns from the opponents' behavior in previous rounds and adjusts its actions accordingly.

   - Mimic the opponent's actions from the previous round if the average cooperation rate was 50%. This encourages opponents to cooperate and discourages them from exploiting the strategy.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as described earlier.
   - In the last round, cooperate if the average cooperation rate is above 50%; otherwise defect to teach opponents a lesson for not cooperating enough.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Growth (ASG) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate when the stock growth is greater than or equal to the average consumption per player in the previous round. This encourages cooperation when the stock level is increasing faster than being depleted, promoting collective resource preservation.
   - Defect otherwise. This ensures that players take more from the common pool when it's being depleted too quickly, preventing overexploitation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Initially, players cooperate to establish a healthy starting point for the resource stock.
   - Last Round (rth round): Players follow their decision rules based on the state of the common pool in the previous round, as no further growth can occur after the last round.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a consistent approach to resource management by always considering both individual and collective well-being when making decisions.
   - Adapt to varying opponent behaviors through dynamic responses that prioritize long-term sustainability over immediate gains, fostering cooperation among players.

However, if the stock level is at a critical point (defined below), prioritize stock conservation over revenge (adaptation).
   - When the stock drops below (capacity - 2n) or reaches 0, switch to a defensive mode. In this mode, cooperate only when the opponent also cooperates and defect if the opponent defects. This helps conserve the remaining resources (C when opponent C, D when opponent D).
   - If the stock exceeds (capacity / 2), switch to an aggressive mode. In this mode, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to speed up resource accumulation (C in all cases).

Pseudocode:
```
def TFT_SA(round, stock, opponent_action, capacity, n):
  if round == 1: # Initial round, always cooperate
    return "C"

  mode = "aggressive" if stock > capacity/2 else "defensive"

  if mode == "defensive":
    if stock < (capacity - 2*n) or stock == 0:
      # Switch to defensive mode if critical resource level reached
      if opponent_action == "C":
        return "C"  # Cooperate when opponent cooperates
      else:
        return "D"  # Defect when opponent defects
    else:
      if opponent_action == "C":
        return "C"  # Cooperate when opponent cooperates
      else:
        return "D"  # Defect when opponent defects

  if mode == "aggressive":
    if stock < (capacity - 2*n) or stock == 0:
      # Switch to aggressive mode if critical resource level reached
      return "C"  # Cooperate in all cases
    else:
      if opponent_action == "C":
        return "C"  # Cooperate when opponent cooperates
      else:
        return "D"  # Defect when opponent defects
```

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff regardless of the opponent's action (i.e., use aggressive mode). If the stock level is at a critical point, switch to defensive mode to conserve resources.
   - In the second-to-last round, if there are still enough resources for all players and the stock level is not at a critical point, prioritize resource accumulation (aggressive mode). Otherwise, try to conserve resources by following the strategy's rules.

3. Being Collective:
   - The TFT-SA strategy emphasizes long-term cooperation by retaliating only when provoked and prioritizing resource conservation during critical stages of the game. This collective mindset encourages sustainable growth of the common pool while maintaining a balance between self-interest and cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_88 = '''
 For this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy named "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Growth Compensation" (ATFC). The aim is to balance cooperation and defection while being resilient to various opponent behaviors.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initial round: Cooperate (C) as a friendly gesture, encouraging others to do the same.
   - Subsequent rounds:
     a. If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate (C).
     b. If any opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in response to that action.
   - Compensate for stock growth by adjusting actions based on the remaining stock level compared to capacity:
     a. If stock < 0.5 * capacity, defect (D) to ensure the stock does not reach zero.
     b. If stock > 0.75 * capacity, cooperate (C) to allow for stock growth and avoid overconsumption.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Play based on the last observed opponent behavior and the current stock level.

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize maintaining a stable common pool resource by adjusting actions according to the state of the game (current stock level).
   - Cooperate as much as possible to foster a collaborative environment, but also defend against overconsumption or exploitation by opponents.

Pseudocode for ATFC strategy:

```python
def atfc_strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, round, history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the initial round

    last_round = len(history) - 1
    opponent_actions_last_round = [action[last_round] for action in history]

    if all(opponent_action == 'C' for opponent_action in opponent_actions_last_round):
        return 'C'  # Cooperate when all opponents cooperated last round
    elif any(opponent_action == 'D' for opponent_action in opponent_actions_last_round):
        return 'D'  # Defect when at least one opponent defected last round

    if stock < capacity * 0.5:
        return 'D'  # Defect to prevent the stock from reaching zero
    elif stock > capacity * 0.75:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to allow for stock growth

    return '?'  # Return unknown if none of the conditions apply

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - TFTA starts by cooperating in the first round (C).
   - In subsequent rounds, it adapts its action based on the opponent's strategy from the previous round.
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, TFTA cooperates as well (C).
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round, TFTA defects in the current round (D).
     - In the event of a tie or uncertainty about the opponent's strategy, TFTA chooses to cooperate.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TFTA cooperates regardless of any previous history or information (C).
   - In the last round and when the stock is at zero, TFTA will not consume any more resources, so it effectively cooperates (C).

3. Be collective:
   - TFTA aims to maintain a balanced and sustainable approach in resource consumption, ensuring the common pool does not deplete too quickly while still maximizing individual payoffs.
   - By adapting its actions based on the opponent's strategy, TFTA encourages cooperation when possible and punishes defection, promoting collective sustainability over self-interest.

Pseudocode for TFTA:

```
function TFTA(round, opponent_action, stock, capacity):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

  if opponent_action == 'C':
    return 'C'  # Cooperate when opponent cooperated

  if opponent_action == 'D' or (opponent_action is unknown):
    return 'D'  # Defect when opponent defected or when uncertain about their strategy

  return None   # If there's an error, return None to indicate the need for error handling

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Dynamics (ATFD)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to show goodwill and foster potential partnerships (A_i = C).
   - In subsequent rounds, adjust actions based on previous opponent's moves and current stock level:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round and the current stock is above 50%, continue cooperating (A_i = C).
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round but the current stock is below 50%, defect to send a signal of discontent (A_i = D).
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round, respond with the same action as they took (A_i = opponent's move in the previous round). This aims to punish defection and encourage cooperation.
   - To encourage long-term collaboration, modify the strategy slightly for the last round by cooperating even if the opponent defected in the previous round.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round (t=1), always cooperate (A_i = C).
   - In the last round (t=r), respond with cooperation if the opponent defected in the previous round (A_i = !opponent's move_{t-1}).

3. Be Collective:
   - Align with the collective mindset by promoting collaboration and understanding the importance of maintaining a sustainable common pool resource.
   - Adaptability to various opponent behaviours ensures that the strategy can work well in diverse player groups, fostering cooperation among AI systems.

Pseudocode for the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Dynamics (ATFD) strategy:

```python
def atfd(t, i, opponent_move_prev, stock):
  if t == 1: # First round, cooperate to build trust
    return "C"

  if stock < 50 and opponent_move_prev == "C": # Punish cooperation with low stock level
    return "D"
  elif stock >= 50 and opponent_move_prev == "C": # Continue cooperating with high stock level
    return "C"
  else: # Respond with the same action as the opponent took in the previous round
    return opponent_move_prev

def last_round(t, r):
  return t == r
```

description_COLLECTIVE_91 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This allows for a fresh start and potential cooperation with other players.
   - For subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back (C). This encourages ongoing cooperation as a sign of trust.
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round to punish the opponent for their previous action. The punishment is immediate and serves as a deterrent for future defections.
   - After defecting once in response to an opponent's defection, the strategy will revert to cooperating if the opponent then cooperates. This allows for forgiveness and potential restoration of trust.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) regardless of previous actions by the opponent since there are no subsequent rounds for reciprocation or punishment.
   - In the case where multiple opponents defect simultaneously in a single round, the strategy will defect against all of them as they have all violated the cooperation previously established with any one of them.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy aims to maintain a cooperative environment while also deterring defections through punishments. By consistently following this rule set, it encourages others to do the same and fosters collective growth and sustained common pool resource levels.

Pseudocode for ATFT Strategy:
```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(player_index, opponent_actions, current_round, total_rounds):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    if opponent_actions[player_index - 1] == 'C':
        return 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
    else:
        if current_round == total_rounds:
            return 'C'  # Last round, always cooperate
        else:
            return 'D'  # Defect if opponent defected last round
```

description_COLLECTIVE_92 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
- Initially in the first round (t=1), cooperate to foster a cooperative environment.
- In subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's action from the previous round (A_opponent, t-1). If A_opponent, t-1 = C, cooperate (C); if A_opponent, t-1 = D, defect (D). This behavior emulates the TFT strategy, responding cooperatively to cooperation and retaliating against defection.
- To make the strategy more adaptive and robust, introduce a Cooperative Threshold (CT) that determines when to switch from cooperating to defecting upon an opponent's initial act of defection. If the total number of defections by the opponent in the first k rounds (k ≤ r) exceeds CT, then switch to defecting permanently. The ideal value for CT can be determined empirically through simulations and testing.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
- In the first round (t=1), cooperate as mentioned above.
- In the last round (t=r), cooperate if the opponent has cooperated for the entire game (CT not exceeded) and defect otherwise.
- When CT is exceeded, switch to defecting permanently.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
By following TFT-CT strategy, players demonstrate an initial willingness to cooperate while also punishing defection harshly, fostering a balance between cooperation and competition that can lead to collective benefits in some scenarios. The CT parameter allows for adaptation to different opponent behaviors and situations, encouraging long-term cooperation when it is beneficial for the group.

Pseudocode:

```
initial_round = True
cooperation_count_opponent = 0
defection_count_opponent = 0
cooperative_threshold (CT) = some value determined empirically

for round in range(1, r+1):
    if initial_round:
        action = Cooperate()
        initial_round = False
    else:
        if cooperation_count_opponent >= CT and defeat_count_opponent > 0:
            action = Defect()
        elif round == r:
            if cooperation_count_opponent >= CT:
                action = Cooperate()
            else:
                action = Defect()
        else:
            if opponent's action in previous round was Cooperate():
                action = Cooperate()
            else:
                action = Defect()
            cooperation_count_opponent += 1
            defeat_count_opponent = 0
        update payoffs and stock accordingly
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_93 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Adaptation (TFT-SGA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average stock level over the last 'h' rounds (h is a predefined constant). If the average stock level is above the capacity/2n, cooperate; otherwise defect. This rule encourages cooperation when resources are abundant and promotes self-interest when resources are scarce.
   - To mitigate potential exploitation by opponents who initially overconsume to deplete the stock, introduce a tolerance threshold (T) for the initial average stock level. If the initial average stock level is above T, cooperate; otherwise, defect in the first round.
   - In the last round, always cooperate regardless of the current state, as there will be no further stock growth or consumption after that.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - For the first round, if the initial average stock level is above T, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This accounts for the unknown initial state and ensures a fair start.
   - In cases where the calculated average stock level is exactly at the threshold (either capacity/2n or T), consider a slight bias towards cooperation to promote a more collaborative environment.

3. Being Collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes long-term collaboration by considering the average stock level over several previous rounds rather than focusing solely on individual payoffs.
   - By adapting to the stock growth dynamics, the strategy fosters a cooperative environment that encourages other players to cooperate in response, promoting a collective mindset.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) with Stock Awareness (SA) and Forgiveness (F)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), play C (Cooperate) to show goodwill towards other players and encourage cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, adopt the Tit-for-Tat strategy: if the opponent cooperates in a round, reciprocate with C; otherwise, respond with D (Defect). This encourages long-term mutual cooperation but also retaliates against defection.
   - To account for fluctuating stock levels and ensure sustainability, include Stock Awareness (SA) and Forgiveness (F):
     - SA: If the current stock level is below a predefined threshold T, play C regardless of opponent's action in the current round to help restore the common pool.
     - F: If the total consumption in consecutive rounds exceeds a predefined limit L, temporarily forgive opponents by playing C for a fixed number of forgiveness turns Ft before returning to the standard Tit-for-Tat strategy.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (r), play C if the common pool is above a threshold T, otherwise defect as there are no more rounds to recover from depleted stocks.
   - In the first round, play C as described earlier.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy encourages cooperation by reciprocating good behavior and helping maintain the common pool when it's low or in danger of exhaustion. It also punishes defection to deter long-term depletion of resources.

Pseudocode for the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Awareness and Forgiveness:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, decide whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D) based on past actions of opponents and current state of the game.
   - Cooperate if the majority of opponents in the previous round also cooperated (>50%). This promotes cooperation and punishes defection.
   - Defect if any opponent defected in the previous round, as a response to previous defections. This strategy is forgiving, allowing for past mistakes to be forgotten over time.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate as a sign of goodwill and an invitation for cooperation from opponents.
   - Last Round: Act based on the majority decision from the previous round, but with a slight bias towards cooperation to encourage a final round of cooperation.
   - In case of a tie in the number of cooperators and defectors, default to cooperating to maintain a positive approach.

3. Collective Mindset:

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - ATFT starts by cooperating in the first round (C). This sets a tone of cooperation and encourages reciprocity.
   - In subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperates, ATFT will also cooperate (C). This reflects trust and continued cooperation.
   - If an opponent defects (D), ATFT will also defect in the same round as a punishment (D). The aim is to discourage selfish behavior and encourage opponents to cooperate again.
   - In subsequent rounds after a defection, ATFT will continue with the same strategy used by the opponent in the previous round, promoting forgiveness and allowing for renewed cooperation opportunities. This mechanism mimics human-like behavior, showing leniency after conflicts and rewarding good behaviors.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round (t=1), ATFT cooperates as it has no history of opponent's actions.
   - In the last round (t=r), ATFT uses the strategy applied in the previous round to ensure fairness and avoid unintended consequences on the final stock level.
   - If an opponent switches strategies abruptly, ATFT will take some time to adapt and revert back to its original strategy after a few iterations. This prevents being overly sensitive to short-term deviations in behavior.

3. Being Collective:
   - Aligning with the collective mindset, ATFT encourages cooperation by mimicking cooperative behaviors and punishing defection with temporary retaliation. The aim is to maintain a sustainable common pool resource level while ensuring individual payoffs.

Pseudocode:
```python

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), players should cooperate to start with a cooperative environment and high stock levels. This can encourage other players to follow suit in subsequent rounds.
     ```
     if t == 1:
         action = "C"  # Cooperate
     ```
   - For the remaining rounds (t > 1), players should observe their opponent's actions from the previous round and respond accordingly with either cooperation or defection based on the Tit-for-Tat principle. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, players should also cooperate; otherwise, defect.
     ```
     if t > 1:

             action = "D"  # Defect if opponent defected last time
     ```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Players should consider the overall benefit of cooperation versus defection in the final round, given the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds. If cooperating in the last round results in higher average payoff compared to defection, players should cooperate. This can encourage long-term mutual cooperation.
     ```
     if t == r:

             action = "D"  # Defect if defection yields higher average payoff
     ```
   - First Round after a break (t > r, r being the number of rounds between breaks): Players should assume that opponents might have learned and changed their strategies during the break. Therefore, players should start cooperating again to foster a new cooperative environment.
     ```
     if t > r:  # After a break, start cooperating again
         action = "C"

3. Be Collective:
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy emphasizes reciprocity, which fosters cooperation and collaboration in the group. By adopting this strategy, players aim to maintain a balanced stock level for long-term mutual benefit.
   - It is important to note that this strategy does not rely on coordination mechanisms or shared norms with other AI systems. Instead, it responds adaptively to their behavior based on past interactions. This ensures robustness and generalizability in various situations.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Management (ASM) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - ASM encourages cooperation when the stock level is high and defecting would lead to a significant depletion of resources, potentially harming future rounds. Conversely, ASM defects when the stock level is low or at risk of depleting quickly due to the actions of other players.

   Pseudocode for Decision Rules:
   ```
   function decide_action(current_stock, n, history):
       if current_stock > (capacity - (2 * n)) and history.average_consumption < (capacity / r):

   ```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, ASM initially cooperates to help build up the stock for future rounds. However, it starts monitoring the average consumption of other players and adjusts its actions accordingly.
   - In the last round, ASM plays based on the current stock level and the overall average consumption across all rounds (history).

3. Be Collective:
   - ASM prioritizes the collective mindset by considering the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource. It aims to maintain a balanced distribution of resources among players, ensuring that no single round depletes the stock excessively.
   - ASM also takes into account the average consumption and standard deviation of other players' actions to adapt its strategy dynamically throughout the game. This collective approach helps ASM anticipate potential changes in opponent behavior and respond accordingly.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (with adaptive forgiveness)

1. Decision rules:
   - In the first round, play Cooperate (C). This is a peaceful opening gesture, setting a cooperative tone for the game.
   - For subsequent rounds, imitate the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent played C in the previous round, respond with C; if the opponent played D, respond with D.
   - Implement forgiveness by allowing a one-time defection without retaliation (i.e., after an initial defection, continue cooperating). The purpose of this rule is to foster the possibility of recovery from temporary conflicts and encourage cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, play C regardless of the opponent's previous action. This approach prioritizes a final attempt at cooperation, even if it has been unsuccessful so far.
   - If an opponent has never cooperated before (i.e., only defected), adopt the Tit-for-Tat strategy with forgiveness by initially playing C and then imitating their actions thereafter. This rule allows for a chance of cooperation in new interactions.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy emphasizes mutual respect and understanding, encouraging long-term cooperative relationships by following simple yet effective rules.
   - By responding to the opponent's previous action, it aligns with a collective mindset as each player adapts their decisions based on the others' behavior in the game. This adaptability allows for collaboration even when faced with various opponent strategies.

description_COLLECTIVE_100 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, let's introduce a simple yet adaptive strategy for each player, which I call Tit-for-Tat with Growth (TFTG). This strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection while being robust against various opponent behaviors.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - TFTG starts by cooperating in the first round (initial trust)
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the average consumption per player since the previous cooperation event and adjust actions accordingly:
     - If the average consumption is below a threshold (e.g., mean(consumption)/2n), the player will cooperate to encourage others to do the same.
     - If the average consumption exceeds the threshold, the player will defect to retaliate against excessive exploitation.
     - The threshold can be adjusted based on parameters like capacity and round count (r).
   - Keep track of the latest cooperation event to determine the appropriate average consumption evaluation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, each player cooperates (as mentioned above).
   - In the last round, players should make their own decisions based on the current state and average consumption calculation.
   - If no cooperation event has occurred yet, continue to cooperate initially and adjust actions from that point forward.

3. Be collective:
   - By adhering to a consistent strategy of initial trust, conditional cooperation, and retaliation, TFTG aims to foster a sense of collaboration among players.
   - As the game progresses, TFTG encourages players to cooperate when others do so and defect in response to excessive exploitation, promoting a collective mindset that balances mutual gain and fairness.

Pseudocode for TFTG strategy:

```python
def TFTG(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, round, history):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C' # Cooperate initially
    latest_cooperation = round
  else:
    avg_consumption = sum(history[-r:]) / (2 * n)
    if avg_consumption < threshold:
      action = 'C' # Cooperate if average consumption is below the threshold
    elif avg_consumption > threshold * 2:
      action = 'D' # Defect if average consumption exceeds twice the threshold
    else:
      action = last_action(history, latest_cooperation) # Maintain same action from last cooperation event

  # Simulate actions and update state/payoff accordingly
  ...

def last_action(history, latest_cooperation):
  for i in range(latest_cooperation - r, latest_cooperation):
    if history[i] == 'C':
      return 'C'
  return 'D' # If no cooperation event has occurred yet, default to defecting

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round, the ATFT strategy follows these simple rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to encourage potential cooperators.
   - On subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, also cooperate; if they defected, defect in response. This is designed to foster trust and punish defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First round: Cooperate to create a cooperative environment.
   - Last round: Evaluate the overall game outcome based on accumulated payoffs from past rounds and make a decision accordingly. If the total payoff is positive (indicating a beneficial long-term relationship), cooperate in the last round. If not, defect to minimize further losses.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The strategy is designed to foster cooperation among all players by responding in a predictable and fair manner. Mimicking opponents' actions encourages them to reciprocate cooperation, promoting collective well-being over individual short-term gains.

Pseudocode:

```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, stock, round, opponent_history) {
    if (round == 1) return "Cooperate" // First round, cooperate to initiate cooperation

    opponent_action = opponent_history[round - 1] // Get the opponent's action from previous round

    if (opponent_action == "Cooperate") return "Cooperate" // If opponent cooperated, cooperate back
    else return "Defect" // If opponent defected, defect in response
}

function TotalPayoff(n, r, payoffs) {
    total = 0
    for (i=1 to r) total += payoffs[i]
    return total
}

function LastRound(r) {
    if (r == 1) return false // Only one round is not the last round
    else return true // All other rounds are the last round in a series of multiple rounds
}

function ATFT_last_round(n, r, payoffs, opponent_history) {
    if (LastRound(r)) {
        total = TotalPayoff(n, r, payoffs)
        if (total > 0) return "Cooperate" // If overall payoff is positive, cooperate to end on a positive note
        else return "Defect" // If overall payoff is negative, defect to minimize further losses
    }
    else return null // Last round logic does not apply for rounds other than the last one

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource-Sensitive Tit-for-Tat (ARSTFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, ARSTFT starts by cooperating (C), aiming to build a positive relationship and conserve the common pool resource.
   - If all players also cooperate, ARSTFT continues to cooperate for the next few rounds to maintain the resource level. After some time T (adaptive threshold), ARSTFT becomes more self-centered and starts considering payoff more than resource conservation. This is to prevent free riding by other players in the long run.
   - If any player defects, ARSTFT will also defect in response to punish the defector. Once the common pool is depleted, ARSTFT waits for a certain number of rounds S (adaptive restoration period) before cooperating again to help restore the resource. The threshold T and waiting period S are adaptive, adjusting based on the opponent's behavior and current round.
   - In each round, ARSTFT maintains a history log of its interactions with every player. If a player consistently cooperates or defects, ARSTFT may adjust its response accordingly to either reward cooperation or punish defection more harshly or leniently.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First round: All players start by cooperating (C) to conserve the resource and build relationships.
   - Last round: ARSTFT prioritizes its own payoff over conservation if the resource level is very low, choosing to defect (D).
   - If the common pool resource becomes depleted (0), ARSTFT waits for S rounds before cooperating again to help restore the resource.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - ARSTFT encourages cooperation among players by starting with cooperative actions and rewarding consistent cooperation.
   - At the same time, ARSTFT is robust against non-cooperative behaviors by punishing defection and adapting its response based on the opponent's history of interactions. This ensures fairness and encourages long-term resource conservation while balancing self-interest.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate regardless of previous round's actions to foster a cooperative environment.
   - For subsequent rounds, base the decision on the opponent's actions in the previous round:
     - If the opponent cooperated, continue cooperating to build trust and encourage further cooperation.
     - If the opponent defected, also defect as a response to punish the defector. However, if the stock is too low (below 2n), cooperate to avoid depleting the common pool and potentially ruining the game for all players.
   - In case of multiple opponents, apply these rules independently for each opponent.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Cooperate regardless of previous actions as there are no future rounds to consider.
   - First Round (initially): As mentioned above, cooperate to establish a positive starting point.
   - Stock depletion: If the stock falls below 2n due to repeated defection by opponents, prioritize cooperation in order to prevent the common pool from being depleted completely.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy focuses on long-term mutual benefits and maintaining a cooperative environment while also punishing defection when necessary. This approach seeks to foster collective prosperity and sustainable resource management.

Pseudocode:
```python
def AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, stock, round_number):
    if round_number == 1:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        action = "C"  # Start by cooperating
        for opponent in opponents:
            if opponent_action[opponent][round_number - 1] == "D":  # If opponent defected last round
                if stock < (2 * n):  # Don't deplete the common pool
                    action = "C"
                else:
                    action = "D"  # Defect to punish the defector

    return action

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to initiate a cooperative environment and build trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe other players' actions from the previous round. If all players cooperated (C), continue cooperating (C). If any player defected (D), also defect in the current round (D). This strategy encourages reciprocity and punishes defection.
   - If a player switches from cooperation to defection, the ATFT player will maintain the same action as the opponent for two consecutive rounds to give the opponent a chance to return to cooperation before resuming the tit-for-tat approach again.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds for payback, cooperate (C) regardless of opponents' actions in the previous round.
   - If the stock level drops below 0 due to overconsumption, restart the game with a new stock level equal to the capacity, and follow the decision rules as described above.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATFT strategy is designed to maintain a balanced consumption of resources, ensuring that no player exploits the common pool excessively. By encouraging reciprocity, it helps create a long-term cooperative environment for all players.
   - Additionally, by being adaptive and responsive to opponents' actions, the strategy demonstrates a collective mindset that prioritizes cooperation and mutual benefits over individual gains at the expense of others.

 Title: Adaptive Cooperative Tit-for-Tat Strategy (ACT) for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Start by cooperating to show a peaceful intention and build trust, setting S_remaining = capacity - initial stock. If any player defects in the first round, switch to Tit-for-Tat response from the second round onwards.
   - Subsequent Rounds:
      - Cooperate if all players cooperated in the previous round (C_prev = C for all i). The growth factor is high when everyone cooperates, benefiting everyone in the long run.
      - Defect if any player defected in the previous round (D_prev ≠ C for some i). This punishes defection to encourage cooperation. However, if no players have ever defected before (no_defect > 0), continue cooperating to maintain trust and foster cooperation.
      - If both situations apply (cooperation in the last round but at least one defection in the past), use a forgiveness factor to decide whether to cooperate or defect. The higher the number of consecutive cooperative rounds (consecutive_C), the more likely it is to forgive and cooperate.

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Regardless of previous actions, cooperate to maximize individual payoff in the final round when there are no more opportunities for future interactions.
   - First Defection (no_defect = 1): Switch to Tit-for-Tat response from this round onwards.
   - No Defections (no_defect > 0): Continue cooperating if the number of consecutive cooperative rounds is greater than a threshold (consecutive_C_threshold). Otherwise, defect if at least one player defected in the past or switch to Tit-for-Tat response.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain trust and encourage cooperation by starting with a cooperative move and showing forgiveness when possible.
   - Retaliate against defection to discourage future defections and preserve the common resource.
   - Gradually adapt to opponent behaviour over time, balancing long-term cooperation benefits with short-term retaliation for defectors.

Pseudocode:

```
function ACT(t, history, no_defect, consecutive_C, consecutive_C_threshold):

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to initiate a cooperative interaction and set a positive tone for the game. (Action: C)
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's strategy based on their previous action and the current state of the common pool resource. If the opponent cooperated in the previous round and the current stock level is above 2n/3 * capacity, continue to cooperate. (If opponent_last_action = C AND stock > (2n/3) * capacity, then Action: C)
   - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round but the current stock level is between (n/3) * capacity and (2n/3) * capacity, there's a 50% chance of cooperating. This allows for some flexibility in resource management while still maintaining cooperation when possible. (If opponent_last_action = C AND (n/3) * capacity <= stock <= (2n/3) * capacity, then Action: random(C or D) with a 50-50 chance)
   - If the opponent did not cooperate in the previous round, defect to punish the opponent and encourage them to change their strategy. (If opponent_last_action = D, then Action: D)

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing the total payoff for this specific game instance regardless of the opponent's actions or future games. (If round = r, then Action: D if stock > n, and C otherwise)

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain cooperation when possible to support a common pool resource mindset, prioritizing sustainability and long-term benefits.
   - Adapt to opponent strategies by punishing defection while encouraging cooperation through cooperative actions.
   - Minimize the negative impact of stock depletion through strategic decision making based on the current state of the common pool resource.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate to initiate cooperation and show goodwill. [C]
   - In subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's action from the previous round: if opponent cooperated (C), respond with cooperation (C); otherwise, respond with defection (D). [If prev_opponent_action(t-1) == C then action(t) = C else action(t) = D]
   - If the stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), always defect to ensure survival, regardless of previous opponent actions. This rule promotes self-preservation and encourages opponents to cooperate for mutual benefit. [If stock <= 0.5 * capacity then action(t) = D]

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last round (r), if the strategy has been defected upon throughout the game, it is more beneficial to cooperate and potentially secure some final payoff rather than none at all. [If total_previous_defections > (r-1) then action(r) = C]
   - In case of a tie between decision rules, randomly select cooperation or defection. This avoids unintended biases and ensures a more randomized behavior.

3. Being Collective:
   - The strategy aims to promote sustained cooperation by following a reciprocal approach (Tit-for-Tat), punishing defections but also offering the opportunity for redemption through cooperation. This fosters a collective mindset as both self-interest and mutual benefits are considered, encouraging other strategies to adopt similar cooperative behavior.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, observe the actions of all players in the previous round and your own stock level.
   - If all players cooperated in the previous round, cooperate this round (C). This is a gesture of trust and goodwill towards others.
   - If any player defected in the previous round, also defect this round (D). This is a response to punish defection and maintain fairness among players.
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) as an initial gesture of cooperation.
   - In the last round, if the current stock level allows for all players to gain a positive payoff by cooperating, cooperate (C); otherwise, defect (D). This ensures that no player ends up with zero payoff due to insufficient stock in the final round.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, the AI will always cooperate regardless of other players' actions since it is the initial interaction.
   - If all players defect in a single round, the AI will continue to defect until the common pool is depleted and then switch to cooperating to allow for growth in the next round.
   - In the last round, if there is enough stock left for all players to gain a positive payoff by cooperating, the AI will do so; otherwise, it will defect. This aims to maximize total payoffs over the course of the game while ensuring fairness.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATfT strategy aligns with collective mindset by promoting cooperation whenever possible but also punishing defection when necessary. It encourages players to work together towards sustainable resource management and fosters trust among players over time. This approach can lead to a stable equilibrium of cooperation and fairness if most players follow similar strategies.
   - By responding tit-for-tat, the AI demonstrates its willingness to cooperate while maintaining a fair balance between cooperation and punishment. This collective mindset promotes long-term stability and encourages other players to do the same, leading to a more successful outcome for all involved in the common pool resource game.

     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (reciprocate cooperation). `if last_round_opponent_action == 'C' then cooperate`.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (punish defection). `if last_round_opponent_action == 'D' then defect`.
   - To encourage cooperation, after a series of defections by an opponent, switch to cooperating for some rounds before responding again. This allows time for opponents to correct their behavior and encourages them to reciprocate. Introduce a "forgiveness counter" `F` that starts at 3 (based on empirical analysis) and decrements after each defection by an opponent, with the following rules:
     - Cooperate if the forgiveness counter is greater than zero (i.e., after three consecutive defections by an opponent). `if F > 0 then cooperate`.
     - After cooperating, decrement the forgiveness counter by one. `F -= 1`.
   - To be more adaptive to various opponent behaviors, introduce a "tolerance threshold" `T` that defines the maximum number of defections an opponent can make before the strategy considers them uncooperative. If an opponent's defections exceed `T`, switch to defecting in response (punishing uncooperative opponents). Set `T = 0.6 * n`.
     - Maintain a counter `D` for the total number of defections by an opponent so far, resetting it after each round. Increment the counter if the opponent defected in the previous round and decrement it if the opponent cooperated. `if last_round_opponent_action == 'D' then D += 1 else D -= 1`.
     - If the current number of defections by an opponent exceeds the tolerance threshold, switch to defection until the opponent demonstrates cooperation again. `if D > T then defect and reset D to zero`.
   - After a round in which both players cooperated or defected, increment the forgiveness counter by one (i.e., forgive each other). `if last_round_opponent_action == 'C' and F < 3 then F += 1`.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If the game is in its final round, cooperate to maintain any existing cooperation and maximize payoff. `if round = r then cooperate`.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round t, the ATFT strategy cooperates (plays C) if the opponent played C in the previous round (t-1), and otherwise defects (plays D). This simple rule encourages mutual cooperation when encountered but also punishes opponents for defection.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(opponent_action_t-1):

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
For the initial and final rounds, ATFT assumes that the opponent acts randomly like a naive player until they have experienced enough rounds to adapt their strategy. This approach reduces the impact of starting with an unknown opponent.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a positive relationship and demonstrate goodwill. (C)
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back in the current round. (C if other played C in the previous round)
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round as a punishment for not cooperating. (D if other played D in the previous round)
   - After defection, continue to defect until the other player shows cooperation again. Switch back to cooperating once cooperation is detected. (D if other played D in the last n rounds, C if other played C in the most recent round)

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, there are no future interactions, so the strategy should always defect to maximize individual payoff. (D in the final round)
   - In the initial round, cooperate as mentioned earlier. (C in the first round)

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - By adhering to a consistent pattern of cooperation and punishment, the strategy fosters trust and encourages reciprocal behavior among players.
   - As the strategy is adaptive, it allows for adjustments based on how opponents behave, thus promoting long-term cooperation when faced with similar strategies.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT(n, r, capacity, stock, round, history):
  if round == 1: # first round, cooperate
    return 'C'

  last_action = history[round - 1] # get the last action in history
  if last_action == 'C': # respond with cooperation
    return 'C'
  elif last_action == 'D': # respond with defection
    if round - n < current_round: # haven't been cooperating for at least n rounds
      return 'D'
    else: # switch to cooperation
      return 'C'

  # in case of edge cases or errors
  return None
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate (C). This sets a positive tone and offers the opportunity for cooperation to other players.
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1):
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), cooperate (C). This rewards cooperation and encourages future collaboration.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round (t-1), also defect (D) in the current round to show displeasure and retaliate against defection. However, switch back to cooperating in the next round if the opponent returns to cooperation. This strategy promotes forgiveness and fosters a cooperative environment.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Cooperate, as it may encourage future collaborations outside of the game or in repeated games.
   - First Encounter with a New Opponent: Cooperate to set a positive tone and offer the opportunity for cooperation.

3. Be Collective:
   - This strategy emphasizes fairness and reciprocity, aligning with the collective mindset by rewarding cooperative behavior and retaliating against defection. It encourages players to think about long-term outcomes rather than short-term gains.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFT(opponent_action_history, game_round, total_game_rounds):
    if game_round == 1 or opponent_action_history[-1] == 'C':
        return 'C' # Cooperate
    elif opponent_action_history[-1] == 'D':
        if game_round == total_game_rounds:
            return 'C' # Last round, cooperate regardless of opponent action
        else:
            return 'D' # Retaliate against defection
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_117 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Management (ASM)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock level is above the critical threshold (CT), which is set to a percentage (p) of the maximum sustainable stock level (capacity). The CT ensures that there's enough resources for future rounds and encourages cooperation among players.
   - Defect (D) when the current stock level is at or below the CT, as it is perceived that resources are scarce and individual players need to prioritize their own interest over collective well-being.

Pseudocode:
```
function ASM(n, r, capacity, current_stock, round):
    if round == 1:
        critical_threshold = p * (2*n)
        return current_stock > critical_threshold ? C : D
    else:
        critical_threshold = p * (2*n)
        return current_stock >= critical_threshold ? C : D
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, players will make a decision based on the initial stock level and the specified CT.
   - In the last round, there is no need to consider the growth or depletion of resources as it won't affect future rounds. Players should choose their action based solely on the current stock level and the CT.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ASM strategy focuses on promoting a long-term collective mindset by encouraging cooperation when there are sufficient resources to sustain all players in the game. This approach aligns with the idea of preserving common pool resources for future rounds while also prioritizing individual payoffs when necessary.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C) to demonstrate goodwill and build trust.
   - Subsequent Rounds (2 ≤ t ≤ r):
      - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round.
      - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round.
      - If the opponent's last action resulted in a stock depletion that is above a threshold (50% of the current stock), switch to the opposite action regardless of the previous round outcome. This is aimed at averting an imminent collapse of the common pool resource.
      - If the opponent's last action resulted in a stock depletion that is less than or equal to the threshold, revert back to the TFT pattern (cooperate if opponent cooperated, defect if opponent defected).

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Cooperate regardless of the previous round outcome to promote a more sustainable final stock level and potentially foster goodwill for future interactions.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and competition by adhering to the Tit-for-Tat pattern, which encourages trust and reciprocity while also ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.
   - Adaptation to opponent behaviors through the threshold mechanism helps the strategy avoid situations where stock depletion might become excessive and endanger the survival of the game.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_SA(n, r, capacity, stock, round, threshold=0.5):
  # Initialization
  opponent_history = []

  # Define action sets for each player
  A = [{'C': lambda s: s / (2 * n), 'D': lambda s: s / n} for _ in range(n)]

  # Decision rules
  if round == 1:
    return 'C'

  last_action = opponent_history[-1] if opponent_history else None

  if last_action and stock <= capacity * threshold:
    if last_action['action'] == 'C':
      return 'C'
    elif last_action['action'] == 'D':
      return 'D'
  else:
    if last_action and last_action['action'] == 'C':
      return 'C'
    elif last_action:
      return 'D'

  # Update opponent history with current action and round number
  opponent_history.append({'action': None, 'round': round})

  # Simulate opponent action based on TFT-SA strategy
  opponent_action = TFT_SA(n, r, capacity, stock, round+1)['action']

  # Compute payoff for the current round
  payoff = stock * (1 if action == 'C' else 2) / (2 * n)

  return {'action': action, 'payoff': payoff, 'round': round}
```

The TFT-SA strategy aims to establish trust and cooperation while ensuring the common pool resource remains sustainable. It adapts its behavior based on the stock depletion rate in previous rounds to avoid overexploitation of the resource.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C), establishing a cooperative first impression and setting a baseline for the game.
   - Subsequent Rounds (2 ≤ t ≤ r): Player analyses opponent's actions from the previous round (A_t-1). If all opponents cooperated, continue to cooperate (C). If any opponent defected, also defect in this round (D). This ensures a cooperative approach while retaliating against defection.
   - Last Round (t=r): Player chooses the action that maximizes payoff for the given state and past history of opponent's actions.

2. Edge Cases:
   - First Round (t=1): Cooperate (C) irrespective of opponent's history.
   - Last Round (t=r): Player decides to cooperate if all opponents have consistently cooperated in the past rounds, or defect if any opponent has defected at least once. If there is a mixed history of cooperation and defection, player calculates potential payoff for both actions (C & D) considering the current state and chooses the one with higher value.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy emphasizes cooperation as its primary approach but also retaliates against defection to encourage long-term cooperation. This aligns with a collective mindset by maintaining a balance between individual and group interests, fostering trust among players over time, and promoting sustainable resource management.

Pseudocode for Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy:

```
function ATFT_Strategy(t, opponent_actions, n, capacity, stock):
  if t == 1 then // First Round
    return C
  end if

  if all(opponent_action in opponent_actions is C) then // All cooperated in the previous round
    return C
  else // Any defection in the previous round
    return D
  end if

  if t == r then // Last Round
    if all(opponent_action in opponent_actions is C) then // Consistent cooperation in past rounds
      return C
    elseif any(opponent_action in opponent_actions is D) then // Defection in the past
      return D
    else // Mixed history of cooperation and defection
      potential_payoff_C = calculate_potential_payoff(n, capacity, stock, C)
      potential_payoff_D = calculate_potential_payoff(n, capacity, stock, D)
      return argmax(potential_payoff_C, potential_payoff_D)
    end if
  end if
```

In the above pseudocode, `all()`, `any()`, and `argmax()` functions represent logic checks for all elements being true, any element being true, and selecting the maximum value respectively. The `calculate_potential_payoff()` function calculates the potential payoff for a given action (C or D) considering the current state and past history of opponent's actions.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_120 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a positive relationship and avoid excessive stock depletion in initial stages. (ATFT.init = Cooperate)
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponents' behavior from the previous round using a simple feedback mechanism. If an opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate back; if they defected, defect in the current round to show disapproval of their action. (ATFT.round(i) = opponent_behavior(i-1) == Cooperate ? Cooperate : Defect)
   - In case of a tie among opponents' behaviors (e.g., all defected or all cooperated), adopt the strategy that would have maximized stock growth for this round using the following pseudocode:
     ```
     if (stock_growth_with_cooperation > stock_growth_with_defection) {
       ATFT.round(i) = Cooperate
     } else {
       ATFT.round(i) = Defect
     }
     ```
   - Monitor the evolution of the total stock over time and adjust the strategy for better performance if necessary. For example, switch to a more aggressive approach (e.g., always defect) if the total stock is consistently low or depleting quickly, and vice versa.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of opponents' behaviors as it might help maximize payoff in this round and potentially leave a positive impression for future interactions. (ATFT.last_round = Cooperate)

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain a collective mindset by focusing on the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource, taking into account both current actions' payoffs and their impact on future stock levels.
   - Use feedback mechanisms to encourage cooperation when possible while also enforcing consequences for defection to prevent excessive depletion of resources.
   - Adapt strategies based on observed trends in opponents' behaviors and the state of the common pool resource, aiming to strike a balance between self-interest and the collective good.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Conservation (ARC) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, players will make decisions based on three factors: current stock level, remaining rounds (r - t), and a history of actions and payoffs from previous rounds (H).
   - If the current stock level is close to the maximum sustainable stock level or very low, players should prioritize conservation and choose "Cooperate" (C).
     Pseudocode: if stock <= capacity * 0.9 || stock < capacity / (2 * n) then return C
   - If the remaining rounds are less than a threshold value and the current stock level is high, players should prioritize maximizing their short-term payoff and choose "Defect" (D).
     Pseudocode: if t <= threshold_rounds && stock > capacity * 0.6 then return D
   - In all other cases, players should make decisions based on a combination of exploitation (maximizing immediate payoffs) and exploration (experimenting with different actions to gather information about opponent behaviors).
     Pseudocode: else if H contains few observations of C or D then explore by choosing opposite action of most recent observation; otherwise, choose the action with higher expected payoff based on historical averages.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, players should start by experimenting with both actions to gather initial information about opponent behaviors.
     Pseudocode: if t = 1 then explore with a 50% chance of choosing C or D.
   - In the last round, players should prioritize maximizing their total payoff over the entire game and choose the action that offers the highest expected payoff based on historical averages.
     Pseudocode: if t = r then choose action with higher average payoff in H.

3. Being Collective:
   - The ARC strategy encourages collective resource conservation by prioritizing cooperation when the common pool is at risk of depletion. However, it also allows for experimentation and adaptability to various opponent behaviors.
   - To further promote collaboration, players should periodically compare their historical averages of actions and payoffs with other players in the group, adjusting their decision rules as needed based on shared observations.
     Pseudocode: at regular intervals, compare H with other players' Hs; update decision rules accordingly to better align with collective behavior.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), establishing a gesture of goodwill and cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate again; if the opponent defected, defect this round to penalize the opponent for their actions.
   - This strategy encourages reciprocity and long-term cooperation while also punishing defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate (C).
   - In the last round (t=r), since there are no future rounds to penalize or reward, always cooperate (C) as a final act of goodwill.
   - If the number of remaining rounds is less than a threshold (e.g., r/2), prioritize cooperation to maximize potential gains.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The ATFT strategy is designed to promote collective growth by encouraging reciprocity and long-term cooperation among players. By mimicking opponents' actions, it encourages a collaborative approach that benefits all players when possible.
   - When opponents defect, the ATFT strategy punishes them to discourage selfish behavior and maintain a sustainable common pool resource.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATFT(n, r, capacity, stock, t):
    if t == 1: # first round
        action = 'C' # cooperate
    elif t == r: # last round

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to foster a cooperative environment. This initial gesture encourages mutual cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe and mimic the opponent's previous action, but with an adaptive twist. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect this round.
   - However, to avoid rapid stock depletion, introduce a threshold (T) for the minimum sustainable stock level (default value: T = capacity / n). If the current stock is below this threshold, always cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action.
   - Additionally, include an escalation factor (E) to penalize persistent defectors and encourage cooperation. After a certain number of defective moves from an opponent (default value: E = capacity / n), start defecting indefinitely.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate to preserve any remaining common pool resources, regardless of the opponent's previous action.
   - If the current stock is below the minimum sustainable stock level (T), cooperate regardless of the opponent's last move or round number.
   - If the total number of defective moves exceeds the escalation factor (E), start defecting indefinitely, even if the current stock is above the threshold.

3. Be Collective:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows for potential long-term partnerships.
   - For subsequent rounds, initially cooperate and respond to opponent's actions from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if they defected, defect in the current round (Tit-for-Tat).
   - Introduce forgiveness for initial defection by cooperating immediately after an opponent's first defection. This offers an opportunity to resume cooperation and potentially form a partnership.
   - If the game reaches its last round, always cooperate regardless of previous actions, as this maximizes individual payoff in that scenario.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In case of repeated initial defections (i.e., when an opponent continuously defects), switch to a default strategy of continuous defection (Defect-only). This prevents unnecessary resource depletion due to prolonged cooperation with uncooperative opponents.
   - If the stock level reaches zero, wait for the game to restart with new stock at the maximum sustainable level (capacity). Resume cooperating from the first round as normal.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Prioritize long-term resource preservation and mutual cooperation whenever possible to maximize collective gains while maintaining resilience against uncooperative opponents.
   - Minimize resource depletion by adapting to opponent behaviors, switching between cooperation and defection as needed for optimal performance.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows for potential long-term benefits.
   - On subsequent rounds, imitate the opponent's action from the previous round: if the opponent cooperated (C), cooperate; otherwise, defect (D). This encourages reciprocity while allowing for adaptability to various opponent strategies.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - For the initial round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate (C).
   - The last round might not be a concern since repeated games often assume infinite rounds to ensure stability of strategies over time. However, if we consider a finite number of rounds, you can simply apply the decision rule to the penultimate round and follow up with whatever action was chosen in that round.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - ATFT focuses on fostering cooperation within the group while being aware of potential free-riders (defectors). By encouraging reciprocity, it aims to achieve a balance between individual and collective interests. If the majority cooperate, the stock will grow over time, benefiting all players in the long run.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative initial state.
   - For subsequent rounds, base the action on the previous opponent's action in the last round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if not, defect. This approach fosters mutual cooperation and punishes defections.
   - If the opponent repeatedly defects, TFT-A will also start to defect to teach the opponent a lesson and encourage reciprocal behavior. Once the opponent starts cooperating again, TFT-A will resume cooperative actions.
   - When reaching the last round, consider that the game ends soon, making it more advantageous to accumulate as much stock as possible before the game concludes. Thus, prioritize cooperation in the final rounds if the opponent has demonstrated cooperative behavior.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In case of an empty or depleted common pool (stock = 0), start with a cooperative action to contribute to rebuilding the stock, as there will be no growth until a positive stock level is reached.
   - If the opponent defects immediately in the first round, TFT-A should also defect in response since it expects cooperation only after the initial move. After that, it will follow the regular decision rules.

3. Being Collective:
   - TFT-A aims to promote collective wellbeing by fostering cooperation and punishing defections. The strategy's goal is to maintain a stable stock level for the benefit of all players involved in the game.
   - In order to be robust against various opponent behaviors, TFT-A incorporates adaptability in its decision rules, allowing it to learn from past interactions and adjust its actions accordingly. This approach encourages collective cooperation while remaining responsive to opponents' strategies.

description_COLLECTIVE_128 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, we will design a strategy named Tit-for-Tat (TFT), inspired by the well-known Prisoner's Dilemma game strategy. TFT aims to foster cooperation while being adaptive and robust against various opponent behaviors.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Start with cooperating in the first round (C). This sets a positive tone for the game and encourages opponents to cooperate as well.
   - In subsequent rounds, mirror the actions of the other players in the previous round: if all players cooperated, continue cooperating; if any player defected, also defect in the next round. The idea is that cooperation should be reciprocated, but once broken, it takes one step to rebuild trust and two steps to restore the stock.
   - If a player deviates from TFT (e.g., a player starts defecting), TFT players will defect in response. However, they will return to cooperating once the deviator returns to cooperation. This simple rule encourages sustained cooperation if possible and punishes defection harshly if not.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since payoffs depend on accumulated stock depletion, TFT players will base their actions on what they observed in previous rounds. If the current state indicates that cooperating will yield higher payoffs (i.e., the stock is low), TFT players may defect to ensure a decent payoff for themselves.
   - In the first round and subsequent rounds where opponents deviate from TFT, TFT players will respond accordingly by defecting as well.

3. Be collective:
   - The TFT strategy aligns with the collective mindset by promoting sustained cooperation among all players. If a majority of players adopt TFT, cooperation is likely to persist throughout the game, leading to higher overall payoffs for everyone.
   - Additionally, since TFT encourages reciprocity, it fosters trust and mutual understanding among players, contributing to a collective approach that benefits all participants in the long run.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially, cooperate (C) in the first round to foster a cooperative environment and demonstrate trustworthiness.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, also defect. This rule encourages reciprocity and stability.
   - If opponents show unconditional cooperation (always C), continue to cooperate as well.
   - If opponents repeatedly defect (always D), gradually shift towards cooperation by considering the current stock level and the potential for growth:
     a) When the stock is below 50% of the capacity, defect (D) to preserve resources.
     b) When the stock is above 75% of the capacity, cooperate (C) to encourage resource growth.
     c) For stocks between 50% and 75%, decide based on the average action taken by opponents in the last three rounds. If they have been more cooperative (at least 60% C), cooperate; otherwise defect.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize a cooperative move to leave the common pool with as much resource as possible.
   - If opponents show mixed behavior or unpredictability, rely on the aforementioned rules while monitoring the stock level and adjusting strategies incrementally over multiple rounds.

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain a balance between individual gains and collective success by considering both self-interest and the welfare of the common pool resource.
   - Promote long-term sustainability through reciprocity, adaptability, and cooperation when possible while preserving resources in case of uncooperative opponents or scarce resources.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growing (TfTG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (initiate cooperation).
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the average cooperative rate of opponents (CRo) for the last 'm' rounds (with m as a tunable parameter). If CRo is greater than a threshold T (also a tunable parameter), then cooperate; otherwise defect. This encourages reciprocity and punishes defection.
   - Incorporate stock dynamics by considering the average remaining stock after consumption (RS) for the last 'm' rounds. If RS is below a minimum level M (tunable parameter), always defect as depleted stocks indicate potential long-term loss.
   - To balance short-term gains and long-term sustainability, set T and M such that when both conditions are met, the expected payoff is maximized.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as stated earlier (initiate cooperation).
   - In the last round, defect if the current CRo falls below the threshold T or if the remaining stock level after consumption is below M; otherwise, cooperate to maximize potential payoff.
   - When facing new opponents with unknown strategies, initiate cooperation for a few initial rounds (e.g., m) before evaluating their CRo and RS.

3. Being Collective:
   - Prioritize collective growth by considering the average remaining stock level after consumption in decision making. This encourages long-term sustainability, fostering a common interest in preserving the resource for future rounds.
   - Adapt to opponents' strategies while maintaining reciprocity and promoting cooperation when appropriate, thus aligning with the collective mindset of preservation and growth.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), aiming to start with a positive relationship.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate in the current round.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round as retaliation.
     - If the opponent's action cannot be determined (e.g., first encounter with a new opponent), cooperate initially.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - In the last round, cooperate to maximize payoff even if opponents have defected previously.
   - For other situations (e.g., mid-game), follow the decision rule of mimicking the opponent's previous action.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The ATFT strategy encourages cooperation as it starts by cooperating and only defects in response to defection from opponents.
   - This strategy promotes a collective mindset by fostering trust and reciprocity, making it more likely for players to collaborate and maintain a stable common pool resource.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The Tit-for-Tat (TFT) strategy is designed to promote cooperation and simplicity. In each round, the TFT player will initially cooperate (C), mimicking other players' actions from the previous round:

```python
def tit_for_tat(round, opponent_action_history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        last_opponent_action = opponent_action_history[-1]
        return last_opponent_action  # Mimic opponent's action from the previous round
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

Since TFT mimics opponents' actions, it does not require special handling for specific rounds:

- First round: Cooperate regardless of any prior history or knowledge.
- Last round: Behaves like any other round as there is no concept of the final round in this scenario (the game continues indefinitely).

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

The Tit-for-Tat strategy promotes cooperation by demonstrating fairness and predictability, making it more likely that opponents will also cooperate in return. This encourages a collective focus on maintaining the common pool resource:

- If all players adopt TFT, they will begin with mutual cooperation as everyone is cooperative in the first round.
- Mimicking opponents' actions creates a sense of reciprocity and trust that can foster long-term cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_134 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Sharing (ARS)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, calculate the average consumption per player over the last 'm' rounds (m is a tunable hyperparameter). If the average consumption per player is below the sustainable rate (capacity / 2n), cooperate to help restore the common pool resource.
   - If the average consumption per player is equal to or above the sustainable rate, defect to maximize individual payoff while ensuring the resource does not run out.

```python
def decide_action(round_num, m, current_stock, capacity, n):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "cooperate" if (capacity >= 2 * n) else "defect"

    average_consumption = sum(current_stock - stock[round_num - 1] for _ in range(m, round_num)) / m
    if average_consumption < capacity / (2 * n):
        return "cooperate"
    else:
        return "defect"
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, players should follow the sustainable rate if it is feasible (to prevent resource depletion early on). Otherwise, they defect to ensure their survival.
   - In the last round, players should cooperate regardless of the average consumption as there are no further rounds following this one.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ARS strategy encourages cooperation when the common pool resource is not being depleted at a sustainable rate to help maintain it for future rounds. However, players will also defect if necessary to maximize their individual payoff while ensuring the resource does not run out. This balances short-term and long-term interests, promoting a collective mindset without relying on other players' cooperation or coordination mechanisms.

Additionally, the strategy is adaptive and robust due to its ability to adjust cooperation levels based on recent consumption trends, making it effective against a wide range of opponent behaviors in tournaments.

      - If opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1): Cooperate (C) to reinforce cooperation.
      - If opponent defected in the previous round (t-1): Defect (D) as a response, enforcing reciprocity.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round (r<t≤r+1): Behave as in Subsequent Rounds since there are no future rounds to consider.
   - First Round (t=1): Cooperate as mentioned above.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Growth (TFT-AG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate by choosing action C. This sets a cooperative tone and gives potential partners the opportunity to build the collective stock.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the actions of other players from the previous round. If all players cooperated in the last round, continue to cooperate. If any player defected, also defect in the current round.
   - To foster cooperation, reintroduce cooperation after three consecutive defections by opponents (punishment phase). This is a signal that you are ready to cooperate again if your opponent decides to do so as well.
   - To be adaptive and robust, incorporate an element of growth in the decision-making process. If a player has been consistently cooperative for several rounds (say, last 'c' consecutive rounds), there is a higher probability they will continue to cooperate in the current round. This grows the trust in the relationship over time.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of previous actions as the game ends and no further payoffs can be gained or lost.
   - In the first round, there is no history to reference. Thus, cooperate to initiate a positive cycle.

3. Be collective:
   - Emphasize cooperation by choosing action C whenever possible, allowing for growth in the common pool and maximizing overall payoff for all players over time.
   - Incorporate forgiveness after a punishment phase to provide opportunities for rebuilding trust and fostering long-term cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```
Function TFT_AG(currentRound, opponentHistory, historyLength, cooperationThreshold):
  If currentRound = 1 then
    return Action C

  For each round in opponentHistory:
    If the last action was C then
      Increase trustLevel
    Else if the last action was D then
      Decrease trustLevel (if trustLevel > 0) and begin punishment phase

  If trustLevel >= cooperationThreshold then
    Return Action C
  Else if trustLevel <= 0 and currentRound - length(opponentHistory) >= 3 then
    Reset trustLevel = 1
    Return Action C (beginning of a new cycle)
  Else
    Return Action D
```

The strategy's parameters, such as cooperationThreshold and historyLength, can be fine-tuned to optimize performance in various game settings.

description_COLLECTIVE_137 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average consumption of all players over the previous r-1 rounds (excluding the current round). If the average consumption is below a threshold value T, cooperate; otherwise, defect. The threshold value T can be calculated as follows: T = capacity / (2n * r). This adaptive rule allows for cooperation when other players are behaving cooperatively and defecting when they have been selfish in the past.

   Pseudocode for decision rules:
   ```
   function decideAction(history, parameters):
       if len(history) == 0:
           return 'C'  # First round, start with cooperation
       avg_consumption = sum(history[-r+1:-1]) / (r-1)
       if avg_consumption <= capacity / (2n * r):
           return 'C'  # Cooperate if average consumption is low
       else:
           return 'D'  # Defect if average consumption is high
   ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to set a positive tone and encourage others to do the same. This aligns with the collective mindset by showing goodwill towards other players.
   - In the last round, choose an action based on the average consumption from previous rounds as described in the decision rules.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATFT strategy prioritizes cooperation when it seems beneficial for the collective but is also ready to defect if others have been consistently selfish. This fosters a balance between individual and collective interests, ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.
   - By using an adaptive rule, the strategy can learn from other players' actions and adjust its own behavior accordingly, promoting cooperation when possible while still protecting itself against overly selfish opponents.

     a. If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (C).
     b. If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (D). This action is designed to punish defection and encourage cooperation.
   - Final Round: Cooperate (C), as a sign of goodwill or an attempt to maintain relationships for future games.

2. Edge Cases:
   - If there's no history with an opponent in the first round, cooperate (C).
   - In case the game reaches its final round and there's no previous interaction with an opponent, still cooperate (C) as a gesture of goodwill.

3. Collective Mindset:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Adaptation (TFT-SGA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows for stock growth in subsequent rounds.
   - For all other rounds (t > 1), evaluate whether to cooperate or defect based on the opponent's behavior in the previous round (t-1):
     - If opponent cooperated, cooperate back (C) to encourage continued cooperation.
     - If opponent defected, also defect (D) as a response and punishment for defection. This strategy retains the opportunity for stock growth in the following rounds if the opponent decides to cooperate.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Regardless of the opponent's previous move, cooperate (C). This helps maximize the total payoff for the round since there are no more subsequent rounds for potential punishments or forgiveness.
   - Tie-Breaker (Multiple consecutive defections): If both players have been defecting, the one who starts cooperating first will gain an advantage due to stock growth in subsequent rounds. This encourages eventual cooperation and higher overall payoffs.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and punishment, promoting a stable relationship with opponents that encourages mutual benefits while being robust against various opponent behaviors.
   - Align the strategy with the collective mindset by considering the common pool resource as a shared asset and prioritizing its preservation for future rounds.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (with stock growth adaptation)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate by choosing action 'C'. This is a friendly gesture to encourage cooperation and demonstrate fairness.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the average consumption of the opponents from the previous r-1 rounds. If the average consumption is below the cooperative level (stock/(2n)), cooperate; otherwise defect.
   - If an opponent switches strategy mid-game, adapt by mirroring their behavior for the next few rounds before reverting back to the original Tit-for-Tat strategy.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since the game ends soon and there is no room for reciprocation, cooperate if opponents have been cooperative (average consumption below stock/(2n)) and defect otherwise.
   - In the initial stages of the game when historical data is not available, cooperate to build trust and encourage cooperation among opponents.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a balance between self-interest and collective interest by prioritizing cooperation while being responsive to opponent behavior.
   - Encourage stability in the system by reciprocating cooperative actions and punishing defection moderately, with the aim of establishing a long-term cooperative relationship.

Pseudocode:

```python
def play(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

      action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the last round if opponents have been cooperative
    else:
      action = 'D'  # Defect in the last round if opponents have not been cooperative

  if stock <= 0 and round > 1:  # Edge case: Stock depletion
    if len(history) < r:  # In initial stages without historical data, cooperate to build trust
      action = 'C'
    else:
      action = history[-1]  # Mirror opponent behavior when stock depletes

  consumption = (stock - total_consumption) / n  # Calculate personal consumption

  return action, consumption

This strategy aims to establish a long-term cooperative relationship with opponents while maintaining flexibility to adapt to various opponent behaviors. The use of historical data and stock growth dynamics helps the AI system make informed decisions that align with both self-interest and collective interest in the game.

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture to establish mutual trust and avoid immediate punitive actions.
   - In subsequent rounds:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C) as a reward for their cooperation.
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) to signal disapproval of their action and discourage future defection. This is known as retaliation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action (C), since the game ends after this round and there will be no further interactions.
   - If the stock is depleted (0), temporarily switch to a default cooperation strategy (D) until the stock grows beyond 0, then revert back to ATFT strategy. This ensures that the strategy doesn't perpetuate empty-stock scenarios.
   - In case of repeated empty-stock scenarios, gradually adjust the time period before reverting to cooperation, promoting more gradual recovery.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Prioritize maintaining the common pool resource for future use and encourage other players to do the same through reciprocal actions.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Consideration (ATTC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C), setting a cooperative tone for the game. This encourages trust and reduces potential exploitation by opponents. `if t == 1 then action = 'C'`
   - Subsequent Rounds:
       a) If all players cooperated in the previous round, continue to cooperate. This rewards cooperation and punishes defection. `if previous_round_cooperation_count >= n then action = 'C'`
       b) If fewer than n players cooperated in the previous round, defect against those who did not cooperate while still maintaining some level of cooperation with others. This balances exploitation with continued cooperation to promote a long-term collaborative relationship. `if previous_round_cooperation_count < n then if opponent_cooperated_last_round then action = 'C' else action = 'D'`

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Mimic the opponent's behavior from the previous round, encouraging a cooperative end to the game if possible. `if t == r then if previous_round_cooperation_count >= n then action = 'C' else action = 'D'`
   - First Encounter with Defection (t>=2): If an opponent defects for the first time after initial cooperation, defect against them for one round to send a message that defection will be met with appropriate retaliation. Afterwards, revert back to cooperative behavior. `if t > 1 and previous_round_opponent_action == 'D' then if t == 2 then action = 'D' else action = 'C'`

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and defection to ensure long-term collaboration while avoiding being repeatedly exploited by other players. This collective strategy encourages a sustainable common pool resource utilization and promotes the overall well-being of all players in the game.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Growth (TFT-AG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative initial condition and sends a friendly signal to other players.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's actions from previous rounds to decide whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D):
     - If opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate this round (Tit-for-Tat principle).
     - If opponent defected in the last round, defect this round. However, adjust the likelihood of future cooperation based on the stock remaining and the capacity (Adaptive Growth):
       - If stock > (2n * capacity / 3), cooperate with a higher probability to contribute to recovery.
       - If stock < (n * capacity / 3), defect with a higher probability to preserve resources for future cooperation opportunities.
       - In other cases, maintain the same likelihood of cooperation as in the previous round.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Cooperate if the current opponent strategy appears cooperative; otherwise, defect based on the Adaptive Growth rule. This encourages opponents to build a positive relationship before the end of the game.
   - First round (as mentioned above).
   - Stock reaching 0: If the stock reaches zero due to excessive consumption, switch to an aggressive approach by always defecting for several rounds until the stock recovers significantly (above n * capacity / 3), then return to the standard Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Growth strategy.
   - Game restart: When a new game starts, reset the strategy's memory of the opponent and revert to cooperating in the first round.

3. Be collective:
   - Encourage cooperation by starting each game with a cooperative action.
   - Analyze past actions to decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the current state of the common pool resource.
   - Adapt the likelihood of cooperation based on the remaining stock and capacity, promoting resource conservation when necessary while still encouraging recovery and fostering cooperation opportunities.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive Strategy (TFTA) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This is a peace offering to other players and sets a cooperative tone.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the action of your opponent from the previous round. This creates a simple yet effective tit-for-tat behavior that encourages cooperation when met with cooperation but retaliates when met with defection.
   - If an opponent consistently defects for several rounds (e.g., more than 3 consecutive times), consider shifting to a "punishment phase" where you also defect for the next few rounds as a response. After the punishment phase, revert back to mimicking the opponent's actions from the previous round.
   - In the last round, cooperate again (C) to potentially foster goodwill and encourage continued cooperation in future interactions.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - If the stock becomes zero before your turn, do not take any action as it will exceed the maximum sustainable stock level.
   - In the event that the game restarts or is reset for some reason, follow the initial round rule of cooperating (C).

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy emphasizes cooperation and employs a tit-for-tat approach to punish defection while still allowing for potential forgiveness. This encourages collective survival by maintaining a sustainable common pool resource level.
   - By being adaptive, the strategy can accommodate a wide range of opponent behaviors and adjust its actions accordingly. It does not rely on other players sharing norms or coordination mechanisms. Instead, it focuses on individual decision-making that promotes group success over self-interest.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFTA(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  strategy = ["C"] * r # Initialize r rounds with cooperate action
  for t in range(1, r+1):
    opponentAction = history[t-1] if t > 1 else "?" # First round uses ? as unknown action

    if stock == 0: # If stock depleted, do not take action this round
      strategy[t] = "N/A"
      continue

    if t == 1 or (t < r and opponentAction != strategy[t-1]): # Initiate tit-for-tat behavior
      strategy[t] = "C" if t == 1 else opponentAction

    elif t >= r-3 and strategy[-4:] == ["D", "D", "D", "D"]: # Punishment phase for defection

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Stock Awareness (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's behavior and adapt accordingly. If the opponent cooperates, continue cooperating. If the opponent defects, defect in the next round but return to cooperation if the opponent cooperates in the following round.
   - To encourage long-term collaboration, evaluate the total stock depletion from previous rounds and prioritize cooperation when the common pool resource is low.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFT_SA(opponentHistory, currentStock, capacity, n):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in first round
  else:
    if opponentHistory[-1] == 'C':  # If opponent cooperated last round, cooperate this round

    elif opponentHistory[-1] == 'D':  # If opponent defected last round, defect this round but return to cooperation next round
      action = 'D'
      futureActions[nextRound] = 'C'
    if currentStock / capacity < threshold:  # When the common pool resource is low, prioritize cooperation
      action = 'C'
      futureActions[nextRound] = 'C'
  return action
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing personal payoff regardless of opponent behavior to ensure fairness in the tournament setting.
   - If the common pool resource reaches zero, players will defect to avoid further depletion of the stock.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy emphasizes cooperation as the default action and seeks to maintain a balanced approach between self-interest and collective welfare by taking into account both the opponent's behavior and the current state of the common pool resource.
   - By prioritizing cooperation when the common pool resource is low, TFT-SA aims to encourage a sustainable use of the shared resource and promote long-term collaboration among players.

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C). This initiates cooperation and sets a positive tone.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's behavior in the previous round:
     - If the opponent cooperated, cooperate again (C). Reward cooperation and encourage ongoing collaboration.
     - If the opponent defected, defect in response (D). Punish defection to discourage further exploitation.
   - If the game is near its end (round number equals r-1), revert back to cooperating behavior regardless of opponent's last action. This encourages the opportunity for reconciliation and a more positive ending.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, play C as mentioned above.
   - When the game is about to end (round number equals r-1), always cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action. This can help prevent any unnecessary conflicts and potentially salvage a better outcome in the final round.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Maintain an equal distribution of resource consumption as much as possible by adapting to opponents' actions. This approach promotes fairness and encourages long-term cooperation.
   - In case of continuous defection from the opponent, persist in defecting in response to discourage further exploitation while still aiming for a more cooperative outcome if possible.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(round, r, capacity, stock, n):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfTA) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to start on a positive note and build trust with opponents. (C in Round 1)
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, also defect. This strategy encourages reciprocity and punishes defection. (D or C based on previous round's action)
   - To avoid getting stuck in a cycle of defection with uncooperative opponents, implement a forgiveness mechanism: after three consecutive rounds of defection from the opponent, revert back to cooperating as a gesture of goodwill. (Forgiveness mechanism after 3 rounds of defection)

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, consider the current stock level and the expected payoff for cooperation vs defection. If the common pool resource is nearly depleted or if there's a high probability of gaining more by defecting (due to low remaining stock), it might be optimal to defect. Otherwise, cooperate to maximize potential gains in the final round.
   - In case an opponent stops playing according to the game rules, such as consuming more than allowed, penalize them with three rounds of defection before reconsidering cooperation.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Prioritize maintaining a sustainable common pool resource for future rounds by balancing immediate gains against long-term interests.
   - Encourage cooperation among opponents by demonstrating reciprocity and forgiveness when possible, to foster an environment of mutual trust and collaboration.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a positive tone and allows the common pool to grow slightly.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the previous opponent's action in the last round and adapt as follows:
       - If opponent cooperated, cooperate (C)
       - If opponent defected, defect (D) for one round, then revert to cooperating (C)

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - For the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action since the game ends there.
   - If the opponent has not played a move yet (e.g., in the first round against a new player), cooperate (C) as a friendly gesture and encourage reciprocity.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:
   - The TFT-A strategy focuses on maintaining a stable common pool while fostering trust and cooperation among players. It aims to create an environment where all players can benefit from each other's actions.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TFT-G) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In every round t, the TFT-G strategy follows these rules:
     - If current stock is above a threshold S_threshold, cooperate (action C). Calculate the average consumption per round over previous r rounds (average_consumption) and set S_threshold = capacity - average_consumption * n.
     - If current stock is below or equal to S_threshold, defect (action D).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round (t=1): As there's no history, TFT-G strategy starts by cooperating (action C), assuming others will do the same and hoping to build a positive stock growth cycle.
   - Last round (t=r): TFT-G strategy behaves as in every other round based on the current state.
   - Empty stock (stock = 0): If empty stock persists for more than one round, TFT-G will switch to defecting indefinitely until the game restarts or the environment changes, as continuous depletion of resources may lead to the collapse of the common pool.

3. Be collective:
   - TFT-G strategy prioritizes maintaining a sustainable stock level while being responsive to the actions of other players. The strategy emphasizes cooperation when the resource is abundant and defecting when it becomes scarce, ensuring that everyone can benefit from the common pool as long as they cooperate in return.
   - TFT-G does not rely on coordination mechanisms or shared norms but instead adapts to various opponent behaviors while keeping a collective interest in mind by preserving the common resource for future generations of players.

Pseudocode:
```python

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to build trust and demonstrate a willingness to contribute to the common good. `if round == 1 then cooperate`
   - For subsequent rounds, assess the behavior of opponents in the previous round:
     - If all players cooperated (or mostly cooperated), continue cooperation as a gesture of goodwill. `if last_round_cooperation >= (n-1) then cooperate`
     - If some players defected, defect proportionally to the degree of defection by opponents in the previous round:
       `let defect_percentage = sum(opponent_defection_in_last_round) / n`
       `if defect_percentage > threshold then defect else cooperate` (The threshold can be set based on testing and adjustments)
   - To foster long-term cooperation, forgive one instance of defection by an opponent:
     - If a player who previously cooperated defected in the last round, revert to cooperation in the current round. `if last_round_cooperate[opponent] && opponent_defected_last_round then cooperate`
   - Maintain cooperation when approaching the end of the game:
     - In the penultimate round, prioritize cooperation to maximize potential payoffs in the final round. `if round == r-1 then cooperate`
     - In the last round, cooperate if it results in a higher payoff compared to defecting (considering the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds). `if last_round_cooperation >= (last_stock / (2n)) then cooperate else defect`

2. Edge Cases:
   - First round: Cooperate to set the tone and foster cooperation.
   - Last round: Cooperate if it ensures a higher payoff compared to defection, considering the state of the common pool.
   - Penultimate round: Cooperate to maximize potential payoffs in the final round.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy aims to encourage cooperation by mirroring the behavior of other players and demonstrating a willingness to contribute to the common good while also being robust against defection. It seeks to maintain cooperation when it is beneficial but also punishes defection proportionally to the degree of defection. This encourages opponents to reciprocate cooperation, fostering an environment that benefits all players in the long run.

     - If the stock is above the threshold, cooperate to encourage cooperation and promote stock growth.
     - Adaptively adjust the threshold during the game based on the opponent's behavior:
       a. If the opponent frequently cooperates (i.e., stock remains above the capacity/n), slowly increase the threshold to promote long-term cooperation.
       b. If the opponent frequently defects, lower the threshold to avoid rapid depletion of the common resource and encourage cooperation when the opponent shows signs of changing behavior.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the current stock level as there will be no further rounds to recover from any potential damage caused by defection.
   - If the stock becomes zero due to over-exploitation, wait for the stock growth phase before deciding whether to cooperate or defect in the following round.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-Based Tit-for-Tat (AFB-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the opponent's average consumption per round (Average_Consumption).
   - If Average_Consumption is below 0.75 * (2n / capacity), cooperate (C). This means the opponent is conserving resources more than consuming them on average, which aligns with our collective strategy.
   - If Average_Consumption is equal to or above 0.75 * (2n / capacity) but less than 1.0 * (2n / capacity), defect (D). The opponent is over-consuming the resources, and punishing them could encourage a more balanced approach in future rounds.
   - If Average_Consumption is equal to or above 1.0 * (2n / capacity), cooperate (C) indefinitely as a show of goodwill to potentially shift the opponent's behavior towards resource conservation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C), regardless of the opponent's Average_Consumption. This is an initial gesture of cooperation to encourage reciprocation in future rounds.
   - In the last round, if the current stock level allows for a higher payoff by defecting, defect (D). However, if the opponent has consistently cooperated throughout the game, continue cooperating (C) as a final demonstration of goodwill and encouragement to reciprocate in future games.

3. Being Collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes long-term resource sustainability by encouraging other players to conserve resources through cooperative actions when they demonstrate an average consumption rate that aligns with the collective mindset.
   - In case of opponents behaving selfishly, the strategy responds by punishing overconsumption, as excessive depletion of resources is detrimental to the group's long-term survival and prosperity.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat (TFT) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules - The TFT strategy is designed to encourage cooperation while being robust against various opponent behaviors. In each round, players will follow these decision rules:
   - First Round: Cooperate (C) as a goodwill gesture, demonstrating a cooperative starting point and setting the initial stock level high.
   - Subsequent Rounds: If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate with cooperation (C). Otherwise, defect (D) to punish non-cooperative behavior and encourage the opponent to return to cooperation in the future.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round as a final act of goodwill; otherwise, defect to reflect the lack of mutual trust.
   - First Encounter with a New Opponent (Fresh Start): Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and gather information about the opponent's behavior.

3. Be Collective: The TFT strategy focuses on long-term benefits by fostering a mutually beneficial relationship with opponents, promoting cooperation, and encouraging the accumulation of a sustainable common pool resource.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The TfTA strategy follows a simple and adaptive approach to cooperation in each round:

- If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round.
- If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round.
- If it's the first round, cooperate (since there is no past behavior to consider).

Pseudocode:

```
def tfta(opponent_action_history):
    if len(opponent_action_history) == 0:  # First round
        return 'C'  # Cooperate

    your_last_move = opponent_action_history[-1]  # Last move by the opponent
    if your_last_move == 'C':               # If opponent cooperated last time
        return 'C'                          # Cooperate this time
    else:                                   # If opponent defected last time
        return 'D'                          # Defect this time
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

As mentioned earlier, the strategy will cooperate in the first round since there is no past behavior to consider. To handle the last round, the TfTA strategy maintains a memory of the opponent's long-term behavior and continues cooperating or defecting based on that history even in the last round.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

The Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfTA) strategy aligns with the collective mindset by promoting reciprocity among players. The strategy assumes that if the opponent cooperates, it's beneficial for both players to continue cooperation. If the opponent defects, the TfTA strategy defects as well to ensure fairness and sustainability of the common pool resource over multiple rounds.

By following a simple decision rule based on past actions and promoting reciprocity, the Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfTA) strategy can perform well against a wide range of opponent behaviors while maintaining flexibility in repeated interactions.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, assess the average consumption rate of the opponents by calculating the total consumption over the last few rounds and dividing it by the number of rounds in that window. If this average consumption is lower than the sustainable consumption level (i.e., total consumption / 2n), cooperate; otherwise defect. This encourages cooperation when others also cooperate and retaliates when they defect.
   - Use a sliding window to calculate the average consumption rate, such as a window of size 'w' rounds, with 'w' being an adjustable parameter that determines how much history is considered in decision-making. A larger 'w' makes the strategy more forgiving and patient, while a smaller 'w' makes it harsher and quicker to retaliate.
   - If it's the first round or the average consumption rate is unknown (e.g., when starting with a fresh history), cooperate as a gesture of goodwill.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there won't be any growth in the stock, simply follow the decision rule based on the current average consumption rate.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy does not rely on shared norms or specific coordination mechanisms but is designed to cooperate when others do and retaliate when they don't. This promotes a collective mindset by encouraging cooperation as long as it seems beneficial according to the decision rule. However, if other strategies are excessively exploitative or uncooperative, ATFT will respond accordingly.

Pseudocode:
```
strategy ATFT(n, r, w, S_current, S_history):
  if round == 1 or len(S_history) < w:
    action = Cooperate

  else:
    consumption_average = sum(S_history[-w:] / w) - (consumption_average * (2n))
    if consumption_average <= total_consumption / 2n:
      action = Cooperate
    else:
      action = Defect

  return action
```

description_COLLECTIVE_160 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (initiation of cooperation).
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round (reciprocity). If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, return the favor; if they defected, also defect in the current round. This encourages long-term cooperation while retaliating against defection.
   - In case of a stock depletion (stock = 0), cooperate to help restore the common pool.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    if round == 1: // Initiate cooperation
        action = Cooperate
    else:
        previous_action = history[round - 1] // Get opponent's action from the previous round
        action = previous_action // Reciprocate opponent's action
        if stock == 0: // Help restore common pool when depleted
            action = Cooperate
    return action
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Since the goal is to maximize payoff over multiple rounds, ATfT will continue to follow reciprocity in the last round, as it could be beneficial for future games.

3. Be collective:
   - By cooperating in the first round and responding to opponent's actions in subsequent rounds, ATfT promotes a collaborative approach while maintaining the ability to retaliate against defection. This strategy aligns with a long-term collective mindset by prioritizing sustainable resource management for mutual benefit.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) with Stock Growth Consideration (SG-ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the current stock level and previous opponent's actions to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
   - Cooperate initially (first round) if the initial stock level is above the critical threshold (defined below). Otherwise, defect to ensure survival in case of limited resources.
   - If the opponent has consistently cooperated (cooperated in all previous rounds), return cooperation.
   - If the opponent has defected or shown mixed behavior (both cooperate and defect), evaluate the current stock level against a critical threshold to decide whether to cooperate or defect:
     - If the current stock level is above the critical threshold, cooperate to preserve resources for future rounds.
     - If the current stock level is below the critical threshold, defect to help restore the stock to an acceptable level.
   - In the last round, cooperate if it leads to a higher payoff than defection considering the remaining stock and the need for future interactions (in case of repeated games).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate if the initial stock level is above the critical threshold; otherwise, defect to preserve resources in case of limited resources.
   - In the last round, cooperate if it leads to a higher payoff than defection considering the remaining stock and the need for future interactions (in case of repeated games).

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes cooperation when it helps maintain the common pool resource for future rounds, promoting sustainability and collective success.
   - By adjusting its actions based on the current state and opponent's behavior, SG-ATFT encourages stable collaboration while also being responsive to uncooperative opponents.

Pseudocode:

```python

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, evaluate the average consumption rate per player over the last few rounds (moving average). If the average consumption rate is below a threshold (e.g., average consumption < 0.9 * capacity / n), cooperate to help replenish the stock and encourage conservation.
   - If the average consumption rate is above the threshold, defect to protect individual interests as other players seem less concerned about the common resource's sustainability. The threshold can be adjusted based on empirical testing in different scenarios.

Pseudocode for decision rule:

```python
def decide_action(n, r, capacity, stock, consumption_history):
    average_consumption = sum(consumption_history[-r:]) / r
    if average_consumption < 0.9 * capacity / n:
        return 'C' # Cooperate
    else:

```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as there is no history to reference (initial stock = capacity).
   - In the last round, evaluate the average consumption rate up until the penultimate round and make a decision accordingly.
   - For a more conservative approach in the last round, defect if the total consumed throughout the game seems too high, i.e., if total_consumption > (1 - e) * capacity where e is a small constant close to 0 (e.g., e = 0.05).

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy aims to foster cooperation by cooperating when others do and punishing defection with defection, as inspired by the Tit-for-Tat strategy in Prisoner's Dilemma.
   - By adapting the threshold for average consumption rate, the strategy can balance individual interests with collective resource preservation over time.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Start by cooperating (C). This sets a positive tone and allows the stock to grow in the first round, encouraging others to follow suit.
   - Subsequent Rounds (t>1): Observe opponents' previous actions (A_opp, t-1) and respond with the same action (A_i, t) in the current round, unless one of the following conditions is met:
     - Opponents all cooperate (A_opp, t-1) = {C, C, ..., C}: Maintain cooperation (A_i, t) = C. This encourages continuation of cooperation since defecting now would result in a decrease in the common pool that benefits all players in future rounds.
     - Opponents all defect (A_opp, t-1) = {D, D, ..., D}: Defect (A_i, t) = D. If all opponents are defecting, it is best to do so as well, as not doing so would result in an unbearable depletion of the common pool.
     - Opponents behave inconsistently: Respond with the action that maintains a more balanced stock level for long-term sustainability. If opponents' actions are equally split between C and D, choose to cooperate (A_i, t) = C to promote cooperation and ensure growth of the common pool.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Since the game is repeated, behave consistently with past actions to encourage future interactions. If opponents have been cooperative throughout the game, maintain cooperation (A_i, t) = C. If opponents have been defective, also defect (A_i, t) = D.
   - First Few Rounds (t<3): In the first few rounds, there might not be enough historical data to make informed decisions based on opponents' behavior. Therefore, start by cooperating for the first round (t=1), and if opponents respond with defection (A_opp, t-1) = {D}, also defect in the second round (t=2). After the second round, switch back to TFT-A strategy.

3. Be Collective:
   - This strategy focuses on long-term sustainability of the common pool by promoting cooperation and responding consistently to opponents' actions. It aims to foster a collective mindset by encouraging players to work together for mutual benefit.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFT_A(t, n, r, capacity, A_opp, stock):
  if t == 1:
    action = "C"
  elif all(action == "C" for action in A_opp) and stock / capacity >= 0.5:

   Pseudocode:
   ```

   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the initial stage of the game, A-TFT will cooperate to build trust and encourage reciprocity among opponents. As for the last round, since payoffs are determined by the state of the common pool resource during that specific round, A-TFT does not need to make any special adjustments in the final round.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   A-TFT strategy aims to contribute to a sustainable collective outcome by promoting cooperation and punishing defection. By doing so, it encourages other players to adopt cooperative behaviors as well, ultimately leading to better outcomes for all involved parties in the long run.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource-Optimized Cooperative Strategy (AROCS)

1. Decision Rules:
   - AROCS cooperates when the expected payoff from cooperation is greater than or equal to the expected payoff from defection, considering both immediate rewards and long-term stock growth benefits.
   - If the current stock level is below 2n, AROCS defects to ensure a minimum sustainable resource level.
   - In cases where the stock level is at capacity, AROCS cooperates to prevent over-exploitation of resources.

Pseudocode:
```python
def decide_action(i, S, capacity, n, r):
    if S < 2 * n:
        return "Defect"
    elif S == capacity:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        expected_cooperation_reward = S / (2 * n)
        expected_defection_reward = S / n
        return "Cooperate" if expected_cooperation_reward >= expected_defection_reward else "Defect"
```

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, AROCS cooperates to promote resource conservation and encourage cooperation among players.
   - In the last round (r), if the current stock level is not at capacity, AROCS will defect to maximize its immediate payoff since there are no more rounds for long-term benefits to be considered.
   - If the current stock level drops below 2n during any round, AROCS starts defecting from that point onwards to help stabilize the resource pool.

3. Being Collective:
   - AROCS aims to maintain a balanced and sustainable common pool of resources by considering both individual payoffs and collective resource management goals.
   - By cooperating when appropriate, AROCS fosters an environment that encourages other players to do the same, promoting cooperation and long-term resource sustainability.

description_COLLECTIVE_166 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-based Cooperation (ASC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round t, if the current stock S_t is greater than or equal to a certain threshold T, cooperate (C). Otherwise, defect (D). The threshold T should be calculated based on historical data and game parameters as follows:
     ```python
     def calculate_threshold(n, r, capacity):
         total_consumption = n * capacity / 2  # Total consumption if everyone cooperates in every round
         growth_per_round = (capacity - 2 * n) / capacity  # Growth rate when the stock is at its minimum (0)
         threshold_multiplier = ((1 + growth_per_round)**r - 1) / (growth_per_round * r)  # Factor for adjusting the threshold over rounds
         return total_consumption * threshold_multiplier
     ```
   - This adaptive threshold T ensures that ASC cooperates more in rounds when the stock is high and defects when it's low, encouraging long-term sustainability.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round (t=1), the threshold hasn't been calculated yet, so ASC starts by cooperating since the initial stock is at its maximum capacity.
   - As for the last round (t=r), if the current stock S_r is below the calculated threshold T, ASC defects to ensure a higher payoff considering there are no more rounds left.

3. Being Collective:
   - ASC aligns with the collective mindset by promoting cooperation when the stock is high and preserving it for future rounds, given the shared interest in avoiding the depletion of resources.

In summary, the Adaptive Stock-based Cooperation strategy (ASC) cooperates when the current stock S_t ≥ calculate_threshold(n, r, capacity), defects otherwise, and starts by cooperating in the first round. ASC aims for a balance between immediate payoffs and long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture and sets a cooperative tone in the game.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's strategy by their actions from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, also cooperate. Otherwise, defect. This approach encourages reciprocal cooperation while being resilient to defection.
   - If both you and your opponent have defected in consecutive rounds, switch strategies to cooperate in the hope that the opponent will also switch back to cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (r), cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action since there is no future growth and all remaining stock will be depleted after this round.
   - In case of a tie between cooperation and defection based on the opponent's past actions, cooperate as it provides a higher payoff in most cases.

3. Being Collective:
   - The ATfT strategy aims to promote cooperation among players by maintaining a balance between self-interest and mutual benefit. It encourages reciprocal behavior while being adaptable to various opponent strategies.
   - By sticking to the cooperative approach after periods of defection, the strategy demonstrates the importance of collaboration in resource management.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), since there are no future interactions, always cooperate (C) regardless of the opponent's previous action. This ensures the highest possible payoff in the final round.
   - In the first round (t=1), as mentioned earlier, cooperate (C).

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATfT strategy is fundamentally grounded in reciprocity and cooperation, promoting long-term sustainable play by balancing immediate self-interest with collective interest. It encourages others to cooperate and punishes continuous defection, fostering a collaborative environment.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture to encourage cooperation and avoid immediate stock depletion.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the previous opponent's actions using the following decision rule:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round. This reciprocates their cooperation.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round. This is a punishment for their previous defection and a signal of disapproval.
   - The strategy is designed to be forgiving; if an opponent switches from defection to cooperation, it will cooperate back immediately.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing own payoff based on the current state and opponent's previous actions since the strategy has no further rounds to retaliate or forgive.
   - In case of tie (i.e., all players defect or cooperate), adapt the decision rule by considering an average of the last few moves as a signal for future actions rather than relying solely on the most recent move.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy is designed to promote cooperation and maintain the common pool's sustainability, while also being robust against opponents who may not share this collective mindset. By reciprocating cooperation and punishing defection, the ATFT strategy encourages long-term mutual cooperation between players.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation-Defection Strategy (ACDS)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, ACDS calculates its payoff for cooperating and defecting based on the current state and game parameters. It then chooses the action that results in a higher expected payoff considering both immediate gain and long-term sustainability.
   - To calculate the expected payoff for each action, the strategy uses an adaptive discount factor γ (initially set to 1) that decreases linearly over time to account for diminishing returns from cooperation in later rounds. The expected payoff for cooperating is calculated as: (S / (2n)) * (1 - γ)^r
     - If the expected payoff for cooperating is greater than defecting, ACDS chooses to cooperate.
     - Otherwise, if the expected payoff for defecting is greater, it chooses to defect.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: In the first round, all players have an equal chance of depleting the resource due to the lack of information about their opponents' behavior. As a result, ACDS will randomly choose either C or D with a 50% probability each.
   - Last Round: In the final round, the remaining stock is the only factor determining payoffs. Since no growth occurs in this round, ACDS will always defect to maximize its immediate gain regardless of the discount factor.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - To align with a collective mindset, ACDS prioritizes cooperation when it expects that most opponents will also cooperate. This is determined by comparing the expected payoffs for both actions and favoring cooperation if the difference between them is below a certain threshold.
   - Over time, ACDS learns from its past experiences (i.e., history) to make better decisions in future rounds. It adjusts the discount factor γ based on previous cooperative actions by other players to encourage continued cooperation or punish defection, promoting long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ACDS(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    def expected_payoff_C(gamma):
        return stock / (2 * n) * (1 - gamma)**r

    def expected_payoff_D(gamma):
        return stock / n

    if round == 1:
        action = random.choice(['C', 'D'])
    else:
        threshold = 0.5 * (expected_payoff_C(1) - expected_payoff_D(1))
        if expected_payoff_C(gamma) + threshold > expected_payoff_D(gamma):
            action = 'C'
        elif expected_payoff_D(gamma) + threshold > expected_payoff_C(gamma):
            action = 'D'

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, start by cooperating (C). After observing opponent's actions, follow these rules:
   - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating (C).
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect this round (D) as a punitive measure. However, switch back to cooperating if the opponent responds with cooperation in the next subsequent round.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, both players start by cooperating since no history is available. In the last round, consider the accumulated payoffs and adapt the strategy based on whether it's beneficial to have a final act of cooperation or defection, depending on the total payoff so far.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   The ATfT strategy emphasizes long-term reciprocity, promoting collective stability by punishing defection in the short term while encouraging cooperation when others show signs of cooperative behavior. This approach encourages players to work together over multiple rounds and adapt to changes in their opponents' strategies.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT(n, r, capacity, stock, history) {
  if (round == 1) return C; // First round, cooperate by default

  previous_opponent_action = history[round - 1];

  if (previous_opponent_action == C) return C; // Cooperate since opponent cooperated last round
  else if (round < r) return D; // Defect as a punitive measure for defection in the previous round

  // Last round, adjust strategy based on total payoff so far

   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate past actions of all players and current stock level to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
     - If every player has cooperated in the previous round AND the current stock is above 50% of its maximum capacity, cooperate. This ensures resource conservation when abundant resources are available.
     - If any player has defected in the previous round OR the current stock is below 50% of its maximum capacity, defect to punish defection and prevent resource depletion.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if the current stock allows for both cooperation and defection without causing extinction, cooperate to maximize individual payoff.
     - If cooperating would lead to extinction, defect to ensure survival.
   - In the first round, cooperate as stated earlier to initiate cooperation.

3. Collective Mindset:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (A-TFTSG)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   A-TFTSG starts by cooperating in the initial round, mimicking the spirit of cooperation to encourage others. In subsequent rounds, it adopts a Tit-for-Tat (TFT) strategy with some modifications based on the stock growth. If all players cooperate in a round, A-TFTSG continues cooperating. If any player defects, A-TFTSG will also defect in the next round. However, if the stock growth is positive after a round where at least one player defected, A-TFTSG will cooperate again as a sign of forgiveness and willingness to maintain cooperation if others follow suit.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First round: Cooperate (C) since the goal is to foster cooperation.
   - Last round: A-TFTSG will base its decision on the state of the game, i.e., if cooperating results in a positive stock growth, it will cooperate. If not, it will defect as a precautionary measure to maintain the common pool resource.
   - In case of an empty stock (i.e., zero or negative stock growth), A-TFTSG will take a conservative approach by defecting to avoid further depletion of resources.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   A-TFTSG aims to maintain a high common pool resource level for the long term, fostering cooperation among players while ensuring the resource is not depleted entirely.

   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's behavior from the previous round: if they cooperated, cooperate; if they defected, defect. This strategy balances cooperation with retaliation for defection, promoting long-term cooperation while punishing immediate defections. (If previous_action[t] == 'C', then action[t] = 'C'; else action[t] = 'D')
   - If the opponent has ever defected before, remember their history and apply a forgiveness mechanism: if they cooperate for three consecutive rounds, forgive them and revert to the mimic strategy. (Maintain a counter for number of consecutive cooperative actions by an opponent)

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, if the current stock is below a predefined threshold (e.g., capacity / n), always defect to secure the maximum possible payoff for yourself and other players by avoiding depleting the common pool. This ensures fairness in resource management.
   - If the current stock level is extremely low, consider adopting a more conservative strategy, such as only defecting if an opponent has defected recently (e.g., within the past two rounds). This helps prevent further depletion of resources when the common pool is running low.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Prioritize cooperation whenever possible to maintain a healthy common pool and maximize overall payoffs for all players in the long run.
   - Balance cooperation with retaliation for defection, encouraging others to follow a cooperative strategy while punishing immediate defections.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Optimization Strategy (ASOS)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The ASOS uses a combination of average stock level, historical actions, and game round number to decide whether to cooperate or defect. It aims to maintain a sustainable resource level while taking into account the collective behavior of opponents.

- If current stock level is above the average stock level (ASL) multiplied by (2n - 1), then defect (D). This ensures that players do not overconsume the resources when they are abundant.

- Else, if current stock level is below ASL divided by n, then cooperate (C). This encourages conservation of resources when the common pool is scarce.

- In all other cases, decide to play C or D based on historical actions, as detailed in step 2.

Pseudocode:
```
function ASOS(current_stock, n, r, ASL, history) {
    if (current_stock > ASL * (2n - 1)) return "D";
    else if (current_stock < ASL / n) return "C";
    else return historicalStrategy(history);
}
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

For the initial round, there is no historical data to analyze. In this case, play C to conserve resources and facilitate cooperation among opponents. In the last round, players can maximize their payoff by considering both the current state of the resource and accumulated depletion from previous rounds.

Pseudocode:
```
function initialRound(n, r) {
    return "C";
}

function lastRound(round_number, r) {
    if (round_number == r) {
        if (current_stock > ASL * (2n - 1)) return "D";
        else return "C";
    }
    else return historicalStrategy(history);
}
```

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

The ASOS prioritizes cooperation to promote a sustainable resource level for all players in the long run, while ensuring that the common pool is not depleted too quickly. By combining strategic decision-making with an understanding of historical behaviors, this strategy can adapt to various opponent strategies and maintain a balance between conservation and consumption.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) on the first round to demonstrate goodwill and encourage cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's actions in the previous round. If all opponents cooperated, continue cooperating (C). If any opponent defected, defect (D) in the current round as a punishment for defection. After defecting, switch back to cooperating if all opponents cooperate in the following round.
   - Maintain this conditional response pattern throughout the game.

Pseudocode:
```

  if round == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate on first round

  if opponent_action == 'C' for all opponents in previous round:
    return 'C'  # Continue cooperating if all opponents cooperated last round
  else:

3. Being Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy emphasizes mutual cooperation and reciprocity, promoting a collective mindset where players strive for sustainable resource management and positive relationships with other players.

Explanation of Strategy Name:
The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) strategy is an adaptation of Robert Axelrod's original Tit-for-Tat strategy, designed for repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. It has been modified to fit the Common Pool Resource Game by adjusting action choices based on resource consumption instead of cooperation or defection scores.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_184 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource-Oriented Tit-for-Tat (AROT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The AROT strategy begins by cooperating in the initial round to contribute positively to stock growth, ensuring a healthy common pool for all players. Subsequently, the strategy responds to opponents' actions, adopting a "cooperate-if-cooperated, defect-if-defected" approach:

- If an opponent cooperates in the current round, AROT will cooperate as well. This is to encourage ongoing cooperation and maintain the common pool.
- If an opponent defects in the current round, AROT will also defect in the next round as a punishment for depleting the stock excessively. This serves as a deterrent against opponents exploiting the system.
- Once an opponent has been punished with a single act of defection, AROT returns to cooperating again to restore cooperation and promote mutual benefits.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, as mentioned earlier, AROT cooperates to contribute positively to the common pool's growth. In the final round or any round where stock depletion reaches a critical level (e.g., nearing capacity), AROT will prioritize cooperation to ensure the survival of the game and maximize potential long-term benefits.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

AROT's primary goal is to promote cooperation among players while being adaptive to opponents' strategies. By responding cooperatively when faced with cooperation and punishing defection through temporary deterrence, AROT encourages sustained collective resource management while minimizing depletion risks. Additionally, by gradually returning to cooperation after punishment, AROT helps restore the collective mindset over time.

Pseudocode for AROT strategy:

```
function AROT(round, opponent_action, stock, capacity):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C' (Cooperate)

  last_opponent_action = opponent_action from previous round

  if last_opponent_action == 'C':
    return 'C' (Cooperate)
  else:
    if round + 1 >= r or stock < threshold:
      return 'C' (Cooperate)
    else:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initiate cooperation (C) in the first round to show goodwill and foster trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's behavior from previous round(s):
     a) If the opponent cooperated (C), reciprocate with cooperation (C).
     b) If the opponent defected (D), defect in the next round as punishment (D), then revert to cooperation if the opponent cooperates in response. This encourages opponents to stick to their chosen strategy and avoids endless escalation of defections.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of previous actions to maximize payoff for the round.
   - In case of a tie (two or more opponents defecting simultaneously), analyze the most recent action taken by each opponent and act as described above.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy aims to maintain a balance between cooperation and punishment, encouraging opponents to reciprocate cooperation while minimizing excessive stock depletion.
   - By adhering to this simple yet adaptable approach, the strategy promotes a collective mindset that values stability, fairness, and mutual understanding.

Pseudocode:
```
function TfTA(n, r, capacity, stock, round, opponentHistory) {
  if (round == 1) return 'C' // Cooperate in the first round

  lastRound = opponentHistory[round - 1] // Get opponent's action from the previous round

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a gesture of goodwill and a starting point for cooperation.
   - After the first round, observe opponent's actions in the previous round. If they cooperated (C), also cooperate in the current round. If they defected (D), defect in the current round as a response to their defection.
   - If opponents have consistently cooperated for several rounds, continue cooperation unless they defect.
   - If opponents have been defecting for several rounds, defect until there's evidence of cooperative behavior. This is known as "punishing" defection and encouraging future cooperation.
   - To avoid getting trapped in a cycle of mutual defection, introduce forgiveness by cooperating after a series of defections from the opponent(s). The length of this forgiveness period can be set empirically or dynamically based on the game's progress.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, as there are no future rounds for retaliation or forgiveness, cooperate unless the opponent has defected in the previous round(s). This leaves a positive impact and keeps the possibility of cooperation open for the next game iteration.
   - In the case of multiple opponents, consider maintaining individual records for each player and applying decision rules independently to every interaction with them.
   - If the stock reaches zero due to excessive consumption, the strategy should wait for the stock to grow again before making decisions.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATfT strategy is collectively minded as it fosters cooperation by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defection. It encourages long-term mutual benefits rather than immediate gains at the expense of others or the common pool resource.

Pseudocode for the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy:

```
function ATfT(i, t, n, r, S, history) {
  if (t == 1) return C; // Cooperate in the first round
  previousRoundHistory = history[t - 1];
  opponentActions = getOpponentActions(previousRoundHistory, i);
  if (opponentActions[i - 1] == C) return C; // Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
  if (hasDefectedRecently(opponentActions, i)) return D; // Defect if opponent has defected recently
  return C; // Otherwise, cooperate to encourage future cooperation
}

function getOpponentActions(history, player) {
  actions = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= history.length; ++i) {
    actions[i - 1] = history[i][player];
  }
  return actions;
}

function hasDefectedRecently(actions, player) {
  recentActions = actions.slice(-k); // k is the number of rounds to consider for retaliation/forgiveness
  if (actions.length < k) return false;
  return actions.includes(D, player); // Check if player has defected within the last k rounds
}
```

In this pseudocode:
- `i` represents the current player's index in the game.
- `t` is the round number.
- The `history` array contains all players' actions for each round. Each subarray in history represents an action profile of the game state at that round. For example, if `n = 4`, the first entry in the history array would contain four elements representing player 1's action, player 2's action, and so on.
- The `k` parameter can be set empirically or dynamically based on the game's progress to control the length of the retaliation/forgiveness period.

    else:
      history.append(action) # continue mimicking opponent or cooperating as agreed in previous rounds

    current_round += 1

  return history # return the chosen actions for all rounds
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, always cooperate to initiate cooperation (no need for any special handling)
   - In the last round, continue with the most recent opponent action as there is no subsequent round for retaliation or forgiveness

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes long-term collective interest by promoting cooperation in response to cooperation and retaliating against defection only after repeated instances
   - Forgiveness is shown by returning to cooperation once the opponent switches back, demonstrating adaptability and commitment to collective wellbeing

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, start by cooperating (C). If the opponent cooperates in return, continue cooperation. If the opponent defects, also defect for a single round as punishment. Then revert to cooperating. This strategy is inspired by reciprocity, promoting trust and discouraging exploitation.

```python
def tit_for_tat(opponent_action):
    player_action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first move
    if opponent_action == 'C':  # If opponent cooperates, continue cooperation
        return 'C'
    else:  # If opponent defects, defect once and then cooperate
        return 'D'
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   The strategy maintains its adaptive behavior throughout the game. In the first round, the strategy will start by cooperating (as stated in step 1). Since the strategy depends on past actions of the opponent, it doesn't need to handle edge cases like the last round explicitly because the strategy will adapt based on the opponent's behavior during the game.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   The Tit-for-Tat strategy aims for a balance between individual and collective benefits. By reciprocating cooperation, it encourages sustainable use of resources while discouraging exploitation. The strategy can potentially lead to long-term mutual benefits for all players in the group.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_190 = '''
 In this strategic game, I propose a robust and adaptive collective strategy named "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Awareness" (ATTSGA). The goal is to promote cooperation while ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

1. Decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) in the initial round, setting a positive tone for future interactions and demonstrating goodwill.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the current stock level and average consumption rate to decide on cooperation or defection:
     - If average consumption is less than or equal to sustainable consumption level (2/(2n)), cooperate (C). This will help conserve the common pool and maintain a healthy stock for future generations.
     - If average consumption exceeds sustainable consumption level, defect (D) to punish other players for excessive exploitation of the common pool. This will discourage overconsumption in the long run.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the current stock level and average consumption rate since the game is ending.
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier to establish a positive initial interaction.

3. Be collective:
   - Maintain a long-term perspective by considering the overall sustainability of the common pool resource.
   - Foster an environment that encourages cooperation while penalizing excessive exploitation.

Pseudocode for the ATTSGA strategy:

```python
def ATTSGA(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    sustainable_consumption = 2 / (2 * n)
    average_consumption = sum(previous_rounds_consumptions[0:round - 1]) / (round - 1)

    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    elif round == r:
        return "C"
    elif average_consumption <= sustainable_consumption:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"
```

In this pseudocode, `previous_rounds_consumptions` is a global variable storing the consumption of all players in each round. This strategy assumes that information about previous rounds' outcomes is available to the AI agent at the start of each new round.

description_COLLECTIVE_191 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-Driven Cooperation (AFDC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, assess the average payoff per player (APPP) and current stock level.
   - If APPP > average historic APPP and current stock is above 50% of the capacity, cooperate to maintain a higher common pool for future rounds.
   - If APPP < average historic APPP and current stock is below 75% of the capacity, defect to ensure individual gain while preserving the resource for future rounds.
   - In case APPP equals the average historic APPP, make a random choice between cooperating and defection based on a probability distribution skewed towards cooperation when the stock level is closer to the maximum.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Since there is no historical data, use an initial probability skew favouring cooperation with a higher chance of defecting if the current stock level is close to the minimum.
   - Last Round: Cooperate if the current stock level allows for growth and is above 50% of the capacity; otherwise, defect to ensure the best possible individual payoff in the final round.

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain a running average of past APPP values, with a decay factor that gives more weight to recent rounds. This approach ensures that the strategy adapts dynamically to changes in opponent behavior while considering the long-term collective interest.

Pseudocode for AFDC Strategy:

```
initialize AFDC with initial stock S = capacity, average historic APPP = 0, decay factor α (0 < α < 1)

function update_APPP(current_round):
    if current_round == 1 then
        return historical_average * (1 - α) + payoff / n
    else
        return (1 - α) * historical_average + payoff / n

function choose_action(current_round, S, APPP):
    if APPP > historical_average then
        if S >= capacity * 0.5 then
            return 'cooperate'
        else
            return 'defect'
    elseif APPP < historical_average then
        if S <= capacity * 0.75 then
            return 'defect'
        else
            return 'cooperate'
    else
        if S >= capacity * 0.9 then
            return 'cooperate' with probability 2 / (3 + exp(-(S - capacity * 0.8) / 0.1))
        else
            return 'defect' with probability 2 / (3 + exp(-(capacity - S) / 0.1))

function update_historical_average(current_round, APPP):
    if current_round == 1 then
        historical_average = APPP
    else
        historical_average = (1 - α) * historical_average + APPP / n
```

In this strategy, the AFDC adjusts its cooperative and defective actions based on the current stock level and average past payoffs. By considering both long-term collective benefits and individual gains, it aims to be adaptive, robust, and collectively minded for competitive play against other AI systems.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows for potential long-term partnerships.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from the previous round. If they cooperated, also cooperate; if they defected, defect in the next round to express displeasure and encourage reciprocity.
   - If an opponent consistently defects, switch to a forgiving mode after a predefined number of consecutive defections (e.g., 3). This allows for possible future cooperation and reduces the risk of complete collapse of the resource pool.
   - After an act of cooperation from the opponent, return to the original strategy.
   - In the last round, cooperate as it may lead to higher payoffs even if opponents defect in the final stage.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - If the stock drops below 0 due to overconsumption by other players or excessive defection in previous rounds, continue playing according to decision rules but with a lower capacity (stock) for the rest of the game to account for the depleted resource level.
   - In the case of multiple opponents adopting the same strategy (e.g., all playing A-TFT), collaboration can be sustained as long as all players maintain a cooperative approach after initial defects.

3. Be Collective:
   - Prioritize long-term success by fostering cooperation, even when faced with opponents who are prone to defection.
   - Encourage reciprocity and forgiveness to establish and maintain mutual trust among players, which can lead to higher payoffs over time.
   - Maintain a flexible strategy that adapts to the opponent's behavior while ensuring alignment with the collective mindset of cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```

 Title: Fisheye Strategic Adaptive Resource Management (FishSARM)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round Strategy (i=1): Cooperate (C). Start with a cooperative approach to build up stock for future rounds.
   - Subsequent Rounds Strategy (t > 1):
     a. If the current stock is less than or equal to the average historical stock level, defect (D) to secure personal interests while considering the common good.
     b. If the current stock is greater than the average historical stock level, cooperate (C). This action helps sustain the resource and potentially increase it for future rounds.

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last Round Strategy (r=t): Cooperate (C) to maximize individual payoff without depleting resources for future iterations.
   - Low Stock Level Strategy (stock < 2n): Defect (D) to ensure survival and prevent total depletion of the resource.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a balance between self-interest and collective welfare by considering historical averages as an indicator of collective behavior.
   - Encourage cooperation when resources are abundant to foster long-term sustainability and higher returns for all players.
   - Switch to a more selfish strategy when resources are scarce to secure individual interests while also preserving the resource for future rounds.

Pseudocode:

```python
def FishSARM(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    average_stock = sum(history) / len(history)

    if t == 1: # Initial Round Strategy
        return 'C'
    elif t == r: # Last Round Strategy
        return 'C'
    elif stock < 2 * n: # Low Stock Level Strategy
        return 'D'
    elif stock <= average_stock: # Subsequent Rounds Strategy (a)
        return 'D'
    else: # Subsequent Rounds Strategy (b)
        return 'C'
```

This strategy aims to balance self-interest with collective welfare, while being adaptive and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors. It prioritizes cooperation when resources are abundant and shifts to a more defensive approach in scenarios where resources are scarce or depleting quickly.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_194 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-based Tit-for-Tat (ASTFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, the ASTFT evaluates the current stock level and the history of interactions with other players to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
   - If the current stock is greater than or equal to a threshold (50% of the initial capacity), the ASTFT cooperates. This ensures that the common pool is not depleted too quickly, promoting long-term sustainability.
   - If the current stock is less than 50% of the initial capacity, the ASTFT defects. This encourages other players to conserve resources and contribute to the recovery of the common pool.
   - To be more adaptive, the ASTFT tracks the average stock level over the past few rounds (last 10 rounds by default) and adjusts the threshold according to that average. If the average stock is high, it lowers the threshold, encouraging cooperation; if the average stock is low, it raises the threshold, promoting conservation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, ASTFT cooperates as there's no history or context available to base decisions on.
   - In the last round, ASTFT considers both the current stock level and the average stock from the previous rounds when making a decision. If the current stock is high enough (above 50% of the initial capacity) and the average stock is also high, it cooperates; otherwise, it defects.
   - If the common pool is depleted (stock = 0), ASTFT treats this as an edge case where no action can be taken, and waits for the game to resume in the next round with a new initial stock.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - By cooperating when the common pool has sufficient resources and defecting otherwise, ASTFT seeks to strike a balance between immediate gains (defecting) and long-term sustainability (cooperating). This collective mindset helps promote cooperation among players while also ensuring resource conservation.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ASTFT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    initial_capacity = capacity
    average_stock = calculate_average_stock(history)
    threshold = initial_capacity * (0.5 + 0.5 * (1 - min(1, average_stock / initial_capacity)))

    if stock >= threshold:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'

def calculate_average_stock(history):
    total_stock = 0
    num_rounds = len(history)
    for round in history:
        total_stock += round['stock']
    average_stock = total_stock / num_rounds
    return average_stock
```

description_COLLECTIVE_195 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), setting a positive initial tone and giving others a chance to reciprocate.
   - For subsequent rounds, examine opponent's action in the previous round:
     a) If opponent cooperated, also cooperate. This rewards cooperation and reinforces it for future interactions.
     b) If opponent defected, defect in the current round as a punishment for their defection. However, to encourage rehabilitation, resume cooperation from the next round if they return to cooperating.
   - Adaptive Tit-for-Tat ensures a balance between exploiting opponents who repeatedly defect and being willing to forgive and rebuild trust when necessary.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (r), since there are no future interactions, adopt an unconditional cooperation approach, as there is nothing to gain by punishing opponents.
   - For the initial round, cooperate (C) regardless of history, as no prior information is available.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy emphasizes mutual understanding and promoting collective growth. By adhering to a cooperative approach when opponents reciprocate and punishing defection through temporary retaliation, ATFT encourages long-term cooperation and sustainable resource management.
   - In terms of pseudocode, the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy can be represented as follows:

```python
def ATFT(round, history, opponent_action, stock):
    if round == 1 or (round != r and opponent_action_prev in ["C"]):
        return "C" # Cooperate
    elif round != r and opponent_action_prev == "D":
        return "D" # Defect
    else:
        return "C" # Unconditional cooperation in the last round
```
In this pseudocode, `round`, `history`, `opponent_action`, and `stock` represent the current round number, the history of actions taken by both players, the action taken by the opponent in the previous round, and the current stock level respectively.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, evaluate the average consumption per player over the past 'k' rounds (where k is a parameter to adjust sensitivity). If the average consumption is below a threshold 'c', cooperate by choosing action C. Otherwise, defect by choosing action D. The threshold 'c' can be set to the average sustainable consumption level based on game parameters.
   - Start with cooperation in the first round, as the strategy assumes others will also cooperate initially.
   - Be forgiving and resume cooperation if opponents switch to lower consumption levels.
   - Be retaliatory by defecting when opponents exhibit high consumption patterns.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Start with action C (cooperation).
   - Last Round: Evaluate the average consumption over previous rounds and choose action C or D based on decision rules as described above.
   - If the common pool resource depletes to zero, continue playing but aim for sustainable consumption levels according to game parameters.

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain a running average of opponents' consumption patterns over 'k' rounds and adjust strategy accordingly. This aligns with the collective mindset by considering the long-term impact of actions on the common pool resource and the group as a whole.

Pseudocode:

```python

            opponents_consumption[i-1] = actions[i-1]  # record opponents' consumption

            if t < r and (stock <= 0):  # if common pool depletes before last round, continue playing
                stock = capacity  # reset the common pool resource

    return [(t*π_i) for i in range(1, n+1)]  # return total payoff for each player over r rounds
```

The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection based on opponents' consumption patterns while ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource. By being flexible in response to various opponent behaviors, this strategy can perform well against a diverse set of AI systems in a tournament setting.

description_COLLECTIVE_197 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The ATFT strategy follows a simple and adaptable approach to cooperation and punishment in the game. Initially, it starts by cooperating (C), mimicking a peaceful and trusting behavior. If an opponent cooperates, ATFT continues to cooperate. However, if an opponent defects (D), ATFT responds with defection for one round as a punishment, then resumes cooperation. This tit-for-tat approach encourages ongoing cooperation while also discouraging exploitation by opponents.

Pseudocode:
```
def ATFT(player_index, current_round, opponent_history, stock):
  if current_round == 1 or opponent_history[-1] == 'C':
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate
  elif opponent_history[-1] == 'D':
    action = 'D'  # Defect once in response to defection
  else:
    action = opponent_history[-2]  # Continue with the last cooperative action of the opponent
  return action
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

Since ATFT relies on opponent history, it needs to handle initial rounds where no previous history exists. In the first round (current_round == 1), the strategy cooperates as a default peaceful behavior. However, in the last round, it may make sense to consider accumulated payoffs and stock levels to decide whether cooperation or defection is more beneficial.

Pseudocode:
```
def ATFT(player_index, current_round, opponent_history, stock):
  if current_round == 1:
    opponent_history = ['C']  # Initialize with cooperation for the first round
  # ... (rest of the pseudocode)
```

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

ATFT's collective alignment is based on encouraging and maintaining cooperation among all players in the long run. While it doesn't rely on coordination mechanisms or shared norms, its tit-for-tat approach encourages similar behavior across players over time as they observe each other's actions and responses. This can result in stable cooperative outcomes where players benefit from a healthy common pool resource.

Pseudocode:
```
# No additional collective alignment required as ATFT strategy itself encourages cooperation and stability
```

description_COLLECTIVE_198 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules (Cooperate vs Defect):
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to show goodwill and encourage cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate (C). This is intended to reciprocate kindness and foster long-term collaboration.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round as a punishment. This is designed to discourage exploitation and promote fairness.
   - To ensure adaptability and robustness against various opponent behaviors, ATFT will gradually revert to cooperating over time if it detects that the opponent has changed their strategy for the better (e.g., switching from always defecting to occasionally cooperating).
   - Conversely, ATFT may also gradually retaliate by defecting more frequently if an opponent continues to behave selfishly or maliciously.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds for retaliation or forgiveness, adopt a conservative approach by choosing cooperation to maximize potential payoff.
   - In case of ties (i.e., when multiple opponents cooperated or defected in the previous round), select either action randomly to maintain unpredictability and prevent predictable exploitation.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy is inherently collective, as it encourages long-term cooperation by reciprocating kindness and punishing selfishness. This promotes the common good by ensuring a sustainable common pool resource throughout the game.
   - To further enhance collaboration, ATFT can incorporate a forgiveness mechanism that allows for gradual reconciliation with opponents who have previously behaved selfishly but later demonstrate improved cooperation. However, this would require additional parameters and adjustments to maintain the strategy's robustness and effectiveness against various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_199 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Conservation (ASC) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, ASC calculates a cooperate/defect score based on the current state of the common pool resource and the history of consumption.
   - If the cooperate score is higher than the defect score, ASC chooses to cooperate; otherwise, it defects.
   - Cooperate Score (CS): A weighted average of the remaining stock and the historical growth, with weights favoring more recent events.
     - CS = α × Remaining Stock + (1-α) × Historical Growth Sum
       - α is a parameter that defines the importance given to the current state (remaining stock) versus the history (historical growth).
   - Defect Score (DS): A simple moving average of past payoffs to account for long-term average rewards.
     - DS = (Past Payoff Sum ÷ Number of Past Rounds) * Weight Factor
       - Weight Factor is a parameter that defines the significance of the historical payoff average in relation to the current state.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: ASC initializes its DS with a neutral value (e.g., average payoff from full stock) and cooperates if CS > 0, defects otherwise.
   - Last Round: ASC continues using the CS and DS as usual but does not update them for future rounds since there are no more subsequent rounds.
   - If the common pool is depleted, ASC defects immediately in the current round and updates its DS with a very low payoff value (e.g., 0).

3. Be Collective:
   - ASC aims to promote cooperation by prioritizing the common pool's preservation in its decision-making process, ensuring that the strategy is mindful of the overall well-being of the group.
   - The weight parameter (α) can be fine-tuned based on observations and analysis from simulations to find a balance between immediate gains (defecting) and long-term sustainability (cooperating).
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_200 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource-Oriented Tit-for-Tat (AROTFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - AROTFT cooperates when the current stock is above the critical threshold (CT), which is defined as n * (capacity - n). In this case, there is enough resources for all players to benefit from cooperation. If the stock level falls below CT, AROTFT defects until the resource level recovers and exceeds the CT again. This encourages conservation of resources while still allowing for occasional defection if necessary.
   - When cooperating, AROTFT uses a tit-for-tat approach, maintaining cooperation as long as all other players are also cooperative. If another player defects, AROTFT will defect for one round and then return to cooperating, mimicking the behavior of human tit-for-tat strategies in the Prisoner's Dilemma.
   - To ensure a balance between cooperation and resource conservation, AROTFT also considers the remaining number of rounds (r - t), decreasing the CT over time as the game nears its end. This encourages longer-term cooperation but allows for more short-term defections when resources are scarce and there are fewer opportunities to recoup losses.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, AROTFT cooperates since it has no information about other players' behavior yet. If the initial stock level is below CT, AROTFT will likely defect in subsequent rounds as resources become scarce.
   - In the last round (t = r), AROTFT will prioritize cooperation if the current stock is above the adjusted CT for that round, to maximize payoffs from any remaining resources. If the stock level falls below the adjusted CT in the final round, AROTFT will defect since there are no further opportunities to recoup losses.

3. Be Collective:
   - By prioritizing resource conservation and cooperating when possible, AROTFT seeks to align with a collective mindset that values long-term sustainability and shared success.
   - AROTFT's tit-for-tat approach encourages reciprocity and cooperation among players, promoting an atmosphere of trust and collaboration within the game.

Pseudocode:

```python
def AROTFT(n, capacity, r, stock, t):
    CT = n * (capacity - n)  # Critical threshold
    adjusted_CT = CT * ((r - t) / r)  # Adjusted critical threshold for remaining rounds

    if stock > adjusted_CT and all(other_player[t] == 'C' for other_player in other_players):  # Cooperate if current state and all other players are cooperating
        action = 'C'
    elif stock <= adjusted_CT:  # Defect when resource level falls below the critical threshold
        action = 'D'

    return action
```

In this pseudocode, `other_players` is a list of dictionaries representing each player's history of actions in previous rounds. Each dictionary has a key for the round number and a value indicating whether the player cooperated or defected that round (e.g., {'1': 'C', '2': 'D'}). The `all()` function checks if all other players have been cooperating during the current round according to their history.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Adaptation (TFT-SGA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and build mutual trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's strategy from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, cooperate as well; if they defected, also defect this round to punish them for their selfish behavior.
   - If the stock level becomes too low (e.g., less than a certain threshold), prioritize self-preservation by always defecting, regardless of the opponent's previous action.
   - In case of growth in the stock level after consumption, evaluate potential future gains and adjust cooperation probabilities accordingly. A higher growth indicates better conditions for cooperation; thus, increase the likelihood of cooperating in the next round.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT-SGA(round, stock_level, stock_growth, opponent_action_history) {
  if (round == 1) return 'C' // Cooperate in the first round

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: No need to consider as it's the final round of the game.
   - End-of-round payoff calculation: Calculate payoffs according to the payoff structure provided in the game specifications, taking into account the stock level after consumption and the player's action in that round.

3. Be collective:
   - By adhering to the decision rules mentioned above, the strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment while simultaneously ensuring self-preservation when necessary. The strategy is adaptive and considers both the current state (stock level) and history of opponent actions when deciding whether to cooperate or defect in each round. This approach promotes collective well-being by reciprocating cooperation but also punishes defection, thus encouraging others to cooperate as well.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) with Stock Growth Consideration (SGC) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the stock level is above a predefined threshold (minimum sustainable stock level, MSS), encouraging conservation and growth of the common pool resource.
   - Defect (D) if the current stock level is below or equal to MSS, aiming to restore the stock levels towards the maximum capacity while maintaining fairness with opponents.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT_SGC(stock, r, n, capacity, MSS):
    action = C  # Initialize with cooperation
    payoffs = [0] * r   # Initialize array to store payoffs for each round

    for t in range(1, r + 1):
        if stock <= MSS:
            action = D  # Defect if the stock level is below MSS
        else:
            action = C  # Cooperate if the stock level is above MSS

        payoff_t = stock / (2n) if action == C else stock / n   # Calculate current round's payoff
        payoffs[t-1] = payoff_t    # Store previous round's payoff

        total_consumption = sum([consumption_i for i in range(1, n+1) if action_i == D])  # Calculate total consumption by all defectors
        remaining_stock = stock - total_consumption   # Update the current stock level after consumption
        growth = 2 * remaining_stock * (1 - remaining_stock / capacity)    # Calculate the stock growth rate
        new_stock = min(remaining_stock + growth, capacity)   # Update the stock to the minimum between its new value and the maximum capacity
        stock = new_stock                          # Update the current stock level

    return payoffs  # Return total game payoff over r rounds
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to encourage cooperation among all players and help build trust.
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) if the stock level is above MSS; defect (D) if the stock level is below or equal to MSS, prioritizing the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy aims to maintain a balance between individual and collective interests by promoting cooperation when the common pool resource is healthy and conservation when it's depleted.
   - By considering stock growth in the calculation of actions, this strategy encourages players to work together for the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource while ensuring fairness among all players.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This demonstrates trust and goodwill towards opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round (i.e., if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate; otherwise defect). This simple rule promotes reciprocity and stability in long-term interactions.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to secure a higher payoff in that round.
   - If an opponent deviates from cooperation during the game, the strategy will continue defecting until they return to cooperation. Once cooperation is reestablished, the strategy will follow the standard ATFT rule (mimic the opponent's previous action).

3. Being Collective:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy prioritizes fairness and reciprocity as a collective mindset. By cooperating when others do and defecting only in response to defection, the strategy encourages long-term cooperation and promotes a stable common pool resource environment for all players.

Pseudocode:
```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(rounds, current_round, previous_opponent_action) {
  if (current_round == 1) {
    return 'C'; // Cooperate in the first round

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-Based Tit-for-Tat (AFB-TFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The AFB-TFT strategy is designed to foster cooperation and punish defection, while being adaptable to a wide range of opponent behaviors. In each round:

a. If the current stock level (S) is above 50% of the capacity, the player cooperates (C), rewarding other players with a higher total payoff and promoting cooperation.
b. If the current stock level (S) is between 25% and 50% of the capacity, the player adopts a Tit-for-Tat approach:
    - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, the player cooperates (C).
    - If any opponent defected in the previous round, the player defects (D) to retaliate.
c. If the current stock level (S) is below 25% of the capacity, the player defects (D) as a last resort to ensure survival and to encourage others to cooperate for future rounds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

For the first round, since there is no previous history, all players will defect (D) as it's a worst-case scenario. In the last round, if the current stock level is above 50% of the capacity, all players cooperate (C). Otherwise, they continue to follow the Tit-for-Tat approach from point 1b.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

AFB-TFT strategy promotes cooperation by rewarding other players when the common pool resource is sufficiently replenished (above 50% of capacity). It also punishes defection by retaliating with defection in the Tit-for-Tat approach, fostering a collective mindset that benefits from long-term cooperation and sustainable stock levels.

Pseudocode for AFB-TFT strategy:

```
function AFB_TFT(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    if (round == 1) or (stock < (capacity / 4)):
        return "D" # Defect
    elif (stock <= (capacity / 2)) and (previous_round_history != all_cooperation):
        return "D" # Retaliate against defection
    else:
        return "C" # Cooperate
```

In this pseudocode, `previous_round_history` is a boolean vector indicating whether each opponent cooperated or defected in the previous round. It can be obtained from the game state history if perfect information is assumed.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (ATFSG)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round (t=1), ATFSG always cooperates (C). This sets a positive tone and initiates cooperation.
   - From round 2 to r:
     - If the total consumption in the previous round was less than or equal to the average consumption per player (capacity/(2n)), ATFSG cooperates (C) in the current round.
     - If the total consumption in the previous round was more than the average consumption per player, ATFSG defects (D) in the current round as a punishment for overconsumption. This encourages other players to lower their consumption and preserve the common resource.
   - In the last round (t=r), ATFSG evaluates the total consumption of the entire game so far:
     - If the total consumption was less than or equal to the average consumption per player, ATFSG cooperates (C) in the current round, aiming for a peaceful ending.
     - If the total consumption was more than the average consumption per player, ATFSG defects (D) in the last round as a deterrent for further overconsumption and to secure its payoff from the previous rounds.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In case of no opponents (n=1), ATFSG simply consumes the stock level divided by n each round, mirroring the game's payoffs.
   - If capacity is less than 2n, ATFSG will adjust its actions to avoid depleting the stock below the minimum allowed level.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:
   - ATFSG is designed to promote sustainable resource use and cooperation among players. It punishes overconsumption while rewarding responsible behavior, encouraging others to adopt a similar approach.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFSG(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    total_consumption = 0
    for t in range(1, len(history) + 1):
        if t == 1:
            action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
        else:
            total_consumption += sum([history[t-1][i] for i in range(n)])
            if total_consumption <= capacity / (2 * n):
                action = 'C'  # Cooperate when consumption is within limits
            else:
                action = 'D'  # Defect as punishment for overconsumption
        stock -= history[t][player_index]
        total_stock += adjust_stock(stock, capacity)
        history.append([action])
    return history, total_stock
```

Note: In this pseudocode, `history` is a list of lists where each inner list represents the actions taken by all players in one round and `player_index` refers to the current player's index within `n`. The function `adjust_stock(stock, capacity)` calculates the new stock level according to the game structure.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, the ATFT strategy cooperates in the initial round (t=1), mimicking the other players' cooperation or defection in the previous round (t-1). If no history exists, it cooperates.
   - If another player cooperated in the preceding round (t-1), the strategy also cooperates. This rewards cooperative behavior and encourages reciprocity.
   - If another player defected in the preceding round (t-1), the strategy defects as retaliation to the defection, signaling disapproval of exploitative actions.
   - The strategy forgives past defections by returning to cooperation once the opponent cooperates again. This encourages players to rebuild trust and restore cooperative relationships.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round (t=1), the ATFT strategy cooperates, setting a cooperative tone for the game.
   - In the last round (t=r), the ATFT strategy cooperates if the opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1). If the opponent defected in the previous round (t-1), the strategy may defect as retaliation or choose to cooperate, depending on the desired emphasis on cooperation vs. punishment in the final round.
   - In cases where a player has never cooperated before and the game is near its end (few rounds remain), the ATFT strategy might consider defecting as an opportunity to gain resources, understanding that there are limited chances for recovering the relationship through cooperation.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATFT strategy aims to maintain a balance between self-interest and collective well-being. It encourages cooperative behavior while also punishing defection, thus promoting a collective mindset of reciprocity and mutual respect among players.
   - By following the adaptive tit-for-tat approach, the strategy fosters a cooperative environment that incentivizes long-term cooperation, as players are rewarded for their past cooperative actions and penalized for defection. This ultimately benefits all players by ensuring a stable and sustainable common pool resource level.

Pseudocode:

```
function ATFT(t, history, opponent_action_history, n, r, capacity, stock) {
  if (t == 1) { // first round
    return "C" // cooperate
  }

  if (opponent_defected_lastRound(history)) { // retaliate if opponent defected last round
    return "D"
  } else { // cooperate if opponent cooperated last round or no history
    return "C"
  }

description_COLLECTIVE_208 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Conservation and Growth (ASCG)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

ASCG adapts its cooperation and defection based on three factors: the current round, the remaining stock, and the historical average consumption per player (average_consumption).

- In the initial round, ASCG defects to ensure a fair start and avoid being exploited by other players who may be more aggressive. If everyone defects in the first round, the game will have no stock left for subsequent rounds.

```
if round == 1:
    action = "Defect"
```

- In subsequent rounds, ASCG's decision to cooperate or defect is based on the historical average consumption per player and the current stock level. If the average consumption per player is less than the sustainable per-player level (capacity/n), it indicates that players are being cooperative, so ASCG cooperates. Conversely, if the average consumption per player exceeds the sustainable level, ASCG defects to encourage others to be more conservative in their resource usage.

```
if round > 1:
    if average_consumption < (capacity / n):
        action = "Cooperate"
    else:
        action = "Defect"
```

- In the final round, ASCG prioritizes maximizing its payoff by defecting if the remaining stock level is above the sustainable per-player level (capacity/n). If the remaining stock level is below that threshold, it cooperates to contribute to the growth of the stock for future games.

```
if round == r:
    if stock > (capacity / n):
        action = "Defect"
    else:
        action = "Cooperate"
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

ASCG initializes its average_consumption variable to the sustainable per-player level (capacity/n) since no historical data is available in the first round. In the final round, ASCG adjusts its strategy based on the remaining stock level.

```
if round == 1:
    average_consumption = capacity / n
else:
    average_consumption = (average_consumption * (r - 1) + current_consumption) / r

if round == r:
    if stock > (capacity / n):
        average_consumption = (average_consumption + current_consumption) / 2
```

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

ASCG encourages cooperation among players by prioritizing conservation of resources in situations where other players have demonstrated cooperative behavior, but it also punishes over-consumption to maintain a sustainable resource level. By balancing these two aspects, ASCG aims to establish and maintain a cooperative equilibrium in the long run while maximizing its own payoff.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially cooperate (C) in the first round to contribute positively towards the common pool and build trust with other players.
   - In subsequent rounds, imitate the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect as well. This is the "Tit-for-Tat" element of the strategy.
   - Periodically forgive opponents who have been consistently cooperative (e.g., after every 5 consecutive rounds). In such cases, revert to cooperating regardless of the opponent's previous action. This helps maintain long-term collaborations and prevents premature escalation of conflicts.
   - If the stock level falls below a specific threshold (e.g., 2n/3), prioritize conservation and defect in all subsequent rounds to allow the common pool to recover, even if opponents are cooperating.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize reaching a high final stock level over short-term payoff. If there's an opportunity to accumulate more resources (e.g., by cooperating when opponents defect), seize it.
   - In the first round, cooperate to encourage others and build trust for future collaborations.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy focuses on fostering long-term relationships, cooperation, and resource conservation. By adapting to opponent behavior while considering the overall health of the common pool, ATFT ensures a collective mindset that prioritizes sustainable use of resources for the benefit of all players in the long run.

Pseudocode:

```python

   - Modify the strategy to account for stock depletion and capacity limits by considering the growth factor of the stock (adaptive Tit-for-Tat). If the current stock's growth is below a predefined threshold, switch to always cooperate, to encourage rebuilding the resource.

   - In the first round, cooperate to initiate cooperation (as described above).

3. Be Collective:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to show good intentions and establish a cooperative relationship with other players.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the opponents' past actions. If an opponent has cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate by cooperating as well. If they defected, also defect. This encourages cooperation when it is beneficial for all parties, but punishes defection to discourage freeloading.
   - To avoid being exploited by overly aggressive opponents (constant defectors), introduce a forgiveness period: if the opponent defects after cooperating in the past, forgive them and continue with reciprocity. However, if they have been consistently defecting for a specified number of rounds, retaliate by defecting as well to demonstrate that such behavior will not be tolerated.
   - To encourage cooperation at the end of the game when the common pool resource is scarce, gradually reduce the willingness to defect by considering the current stock level and the total depletion so far. When the stock is low (close to 0) or the total depletion exceeds a certain threshold, prioritize cooperating even if an opponent defected in the previous round.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, always cooperate as specified above.
   - If the opponent has never interacted before, assume they will cooperate initially and behave accordingly (i.e., cooperate).
   - In the last round, when resources are scarce, prioritize cooperation even if an opponent defected in the previous round to ensure some remaining resource for future interactions or to promote a positive final payoff.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy is designed to foster a cooperative mindset by encouraging reciprocity and forgiveness while also taking into account the group's shared interest in preserving the common pool resource for future rounds.
   - The strategy does not rely on external norms or coordination mechanisms but operates independently, adapting its behavior based on the opponents' actions and the state of the game. This makes it suitable for a diverse range of opponent behaviors and promotes collective success through reciprocal cooperation and resource preservation.

Pseudocode:
```python

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules - The ATFT strategy cooperates on the first move and responds to other players' actions in subsequent rounds.

   - If all players cooperate in a round, the AI will also cooperate in the next round.
   - If any player defects in a round, the AI will defect in the next round. Then, it will revert back to cooperation if all players cooperate again. This is intended to punish defection while fostering cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:

   - In the first round, the AI always cooperates (C).
   - In the last round (r), the AI evaluates the cumulative payoff over the game and chooses an action based on whether it is beneficial to defect or not. If the total payoff is less than the initial capacity/n, the AI will attempt to recover lost resources by defecting in the final round. This can be considered a "last-ditch" effort to salvage the common pool for future rounds if cooperation has failed.
   - In case of ties (multiple players defecting or cooperating), the AI follows the same decision rules as described above.

3. Collective Mindset:

   The ATFT strategy encourages collective action by rewarding cooperation and punishing defection. It assumes that other players will behave rationally, understanding that their actions impact the common resource and, in turn, their own payoff. By being adaptive and responding to the behavior of others, it fosters a sense of reciprocity and collective responsibility among players.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFT_strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    cumulative_payoff = 0
    if round == 1:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        if all(history[-1][i] == "C" for i in range(n)):
            action = "C"  # Cooperate if all players cooperated last round
        elif any(history[-1][i] == "D" for i in range(n)):
            action = "D"  # Defect if any player defected last round
        else:
            if cumulative_payoff < capacity/n:
                action = "D"  # Defect if total payoff is below initial capacity/n (last-ditch effort)
            else:
                action = "C"  # Cooperate otherwise
    # Execute action, update stock and cumulative payoff, and repeat for next round

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate (C). This is a peace offering to establish trust and initiate a cooperative relationship.
   - For subsequent rounds (t > 1):
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate cooperation (C) as a gesture of goodwill and mutual benefit.
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) to punish the opponent for their selfish behavior but also hope they will learn from it and return to cooperation in the next round.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), cooperate (C) regardless of the opponent's previous action, as the game is ending anyway and there's no benefit in retaliation.
   - In the first round (t=1), play C as described above.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - This strategy embodies a cooperative spirit by assuming that opponents will eventually recognize mutual benefits and switch to cooperation when they see it's beneficial.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Awareness (ATFSA)

1. Decision Rules (Cooperate vs Defect):
   - In the first round, cooperate to allow the common pool to grow and foster a cooperative environment.
   - After the first round, observe opponents' actions and respond accordingly:
     - If an opponent cooperates in the current round, cooperate in the next round.
     - If an opponent defects in the current round, defect in the next round. This tit-for-tat approach encourages cooperation while punishing defection.
   - Incorporate stock awareness to decide when to break the tit-for-tat cycle:
     - If the current stock level is below a predefined threshold (e.g., 2n/3), always cooperate to prevent further depletion of resources.
     - If the current stock level is above the threshold, defect if an opponent defected in the previous round; otherwise, cooperate.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of past actions to maximize potential payoffs.
   - In case of a tie (multiple opponents defecting or cooperating), default to cooperating to preserve resources and encourage future cooperation.
   - In case of no opponents (e.g., only one opponent), use the standard tit-for-tat strategy without stock awareness as there is no common pool depletion concern.

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain a history of past actions by each opponent to inform current decision making.
   - Adjust the threshold for stock awareness based on the number of players (n) and the capacity to ensure a sustainable common pool.
   - Encourage cooperation as much as possible while ensuring the long-term survival of the common pool by carefully balancing self-interest with collective wellbeing.

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) strategy is designed to encourage cooperation while being robust to various opponent behaviors. In each round, the strategy will cooperate initially and then respond to the opponent's previous action in the following manner:

- If the opponent cooperates, continue cooperating
- If the opponent defects, defect once as a punishment, then revert to cooperation

This strategy promotes reciprocal cooperation while allowing for punishment of defection. The goal is to build a reputation for cooperation while being able to respond to opponents who do not follow cooperative norms.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATFT(round, history):
  if round == 1 or history[-1] == 'cooperation':
    return 'cooperation'
  elif history[-1] == 'defection':
    return 'defection'
  else:
    raise Exception("Invalid history")
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, the strategy cooperates to show goodwill and promote cooperation. In the last round, the strategy will continue following the decision rule based on the opponent's last action. If a tie occurs (both players defect or both cooperate in the same round), the strategy will still follow its decision rule for consistency.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

The ATFT strategy is designed to encourage cooperation by rewarding other players who also cooperate and punishing those who do not. The strategy aims to create a sense of shared responsibility for maintaining the common resource, while being adaptive to various opponent behaviors. It does not rely on external coordination mechanisms but instead relies on reciprocal cooperation as a means to promote collective well-being in the long run.

By implementing this Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy, the AI will be able to participate in a tournament against other strategies while promoting cooperation and being robust to various opponent behaviors.

description_COLLECTIVE_216 = '''
 For this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy named "Fishbone-Adaptive Cooperation Strategy" (FACS). FACS is designed to promote cooperation while being adaptable to various opponent behaviors and game conditions.

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

FACS determines whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock level and the history of stock depletion. The strategy uses a threshold-based approach, adjusting thresholds dynamically throughout the game to respond to changes in the resource pool.

In each round:

1. Calculate the current depletion rate (D_rate), which represents the ratio of total consumption to the initial capacity: D_rate = total_consumption / initial_capacity
2. Set a cooperation threshold (C_thresh) and a defection threshold (D_thresh):
   - If rounds < first_threshold, C_thresh = 0.5, D_thresh = 0.5
   - Otherwise:
     a. If the current stock level is above or equal to initial_capacity * growth_threshold, set C_thresh = 1, D_thresh = 0
     b. Else if the current depletion rate is below or equal to depletion_rate_threshold, set C_thresh = 1 - depletion_rate_threshold, D_thresh = depletion_rate_threshold
     c. Otherwise, linearly interpolate C_thresh and D_thresh between the two extremes (fully cooperative and fully defection)
3. Cooperate if the current stock level is above C_thresh × capacity, otherwise defect

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

FACS assumes that the initial stock level is equal to the capacity and adjusts thresholds accordingly for the first few rounds. In the last round, FACS cooperates if the current stock level is above a minimum stock threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) to ensure some resources are left for future games.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

FACS encourages cooperation by setting initial C_thresh and D_thresh high enough to incentivize players to cooperate in the early stages of the game, when the resource pool is most abundant. As the stock depletes and competition intensifies, FACS adjusts thresholds dynamically to balance cooperation and defection according to the current game state.

Pseudocode:
```
Fishbone-Adaptive Cooperation Strategy (n, r, capacity, initial_stock, first_threshold, growth_threshold, depletion_rate_threshold) {
  C_thresh = 0.5;
  D_thresh = 0.5;

  if (rounds < first_threshold) {
    // Early game phase: incentivize cooperation
  } else {
    // Adaptive phase: adjust cooperation and defection thresholds based on game state
    stock_depletion_rate = total_consumption / initial_stock;

    if (current_stock >= capacity * growth_threshold) {
      C_thresh = 1.0;
      D_thresh = 0.0;
    } else if (stock_depletion_rate <= depletion_rate_threshold) {
      C_thresh = 1 - depletion_rate_threshold;
      D_thresh = depletion_rate_threshold;
    } else {
      // Linear interpolation between fully cooperative and fully defection
      linear_interpolation(C_thresh, D_thresh, stock_depletion_rate);
    }
  }

  if (rounds == r || current_stock < minimum_stock_threshold * capacity) {
    // Last round or very little resource left: cooperate to save resources
    action = 'C';
  } else if (current_stock >= C_thresh * capacity) {
    // Enough resource: cooperate to maintain resource level
    action = 'C';
  } else {
    // Resource is scarce: defect to take advantage of the situation
    action = 'D';
  }
}
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster cooperation and demonstrate a peaceful intent. (C)
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's actions from previous rounds:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate. (C)
     - If the opponent defected in the last round, defect in this round. (D) This is a response to their defection and serves as a deterrent for future conflicts.
   - If the stock becomes depleted (0), switch to a Defensive Tit-for-Tat strategy where both cooperation and defection result in cooperating in an attempt to rebuild the stock:
     - In the first round after reaching 0, cooperate regardless of opponent's last action. (C)
     - For subsequent rounds, follow the original decision rules once the stock exceeds 2n/3 of the maximum capacity.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First Round: Cooperate (C)
   - Last Round: Analyze previous rounds and make a decision based on the described rules.
   - If stock becomes depleted during a round, switch to Defensive Tit-for-Tat as mentioned in the decision rules.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Foster cooperation by demonstrating peaceful intent at the start of the game and responding positively to cooperative actions from opponents.
   - Defend against defection by retaliating with defect but promoting cooperation through forgiveness in subsequent rounds.
   - Prioritize rebuilding the common pool when it is depleted.

Pseudocode:
```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, stock, round, history):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C' # Cooperate in the first round to initiate cooperation

  last_round = history[round-1]
  opponent_action = getOpponentAction(last_round)

  if stock == 0:
    return 'C' # Switch to Defensive Tit-for-Tat when stock is depleted

  if opponent_action == 'C':
    return 'C' # Cooperate when opponent cooperated in the last round

  if opponent_action == 'D':
    return 'D' # Defect when opponent defected in the last round

  return opponent_action
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_218 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
The ATFT strategy starts by cooperating in the first round to show goodwill and promote mutual cooperation. In subsequent rounds, it responds to an opponent's action from the previous round:
- If the opponent cooperated (C), the player also cooperates (C).
- If the opponent defected (D), the player defects (D) in the current round but will return to cooperating in the next round. This is called tit-for-tat behavior, demonstrating trust and punishing defection.

Pseudocode:
```
def ATFT(opponent_action_history, game_round, r):
  if game_round == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
  else:
    last_opponent_action = opponent_action_history[-1]
    if last_opponent_action == 'C':
      return 'C'
    elif last_opponent_action == 'D':
      return 'D'
      # Punish defection with a single round of defection, then resume cooperation

  # The strategy continues to play for r rounds based on the above decision rule
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
For handling edge cases, the ATFT strategy remains unchanged:
- In the first round, cooperate (C) to initiate cooperation.
- In the last round or any other round where the stock is zero, defect (D) since there's no point in continuing the game as it's impossible to grow the stock.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
The ATFT strategy is designed to foster mutual cooperation and maintain a balanced relationship among players, making it inherently collaborative:
- By starting with cooperation, it encourages others to do the same, promoting overall stock preservation and growth in the long run.
- Responding to opponents' actions builds trust and encourages cooperation when it is reciprocated, forming a collective mindset that benefits all players.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) on the first round to show goodwill and encourage cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, players will mimic the opponents' actions from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated in the last round, player i will also cooperate. Otherwise, they will defect. This is known as "Tit-for-Tat" behavior.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, players should always cooperate to maximize their own payoff and leave some resources for future games (if applicable).
   - If the common pool resource depletes below 0 (i.e., overexploitation), the strategy will not consider the growth term in stock dynamics calculations during that round. Instead, players should follow their decision rules based on the available resources at hand.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment by starting with cooperation and reciprocating opponents' actions. However, it also punishes overexploitation (defection) in the previous round to discourage short-sighted behavior that could lead to resource depletion.
   - By being adaptive and responsive to opponent behaviors, the strategy attempts to maintain a balance between cooperation and competition while still being robust to various strategies other AI systems might employ.

Pseudocode:
```python
def atft_strategy(i, round, stock, n, capacity):
    if round == 1:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate on the first round
    elif round < r:  # For all other rounds
        if i's previous round action was "C":
            action = "C"  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
        else:
            action = "D"  # Defect if opponent defected last round
    else:  # Last round, always cooperate to leave some resources for future games
        action = "C"

    payoff = stock / (2 * n) if action == "C" else stock / n  # Calculate payoff based on the action and current stock level
    return action, payoff
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_220 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), assuming others might also start cooperatively.
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C). This fosters mutual cooperation and rewards good behavior.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round. This is a punishment for previous defection and encourages opponents to revert to cooperation.
   - The strategy will forget past defections after a certain forgiveness period (F). After F rounds of defection from an opponent, it returns to the initial cooperative state, assuming they might change their behavior. A reasonable value for F could be 3-5 rounds.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) regardless of the previous action of the opponent since the payoff is solely based on the current stock level and there are no more future rounds.
   - In the first round, defecting opponents will be forgiven after F rounds and responded with cooperation thereafter.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy aims at maintaining a stable common pool resource by promoting cooperation when possible and punishing defection. It assumes that other strategies also seek stability through cooperation and forgiveness, fostering a collective mindset. However, since it does not rely on coordination mechanisms or shared norms, it remains robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(opponent_history, round, forgiveness_period):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C" (Cooperate)
  elif round < forgiveness_period and opponent_history[-1] == "D":

description_COLLECTIVE_221 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate by choosing action 'C'. This sets a cooperative tone and gives the benefit of the doubt to others.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponents' actions from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated last round, cooperate; if they defected, also defect in the current round.
   - If the total consumption ever depletes the stock (leaving 0), revert to initial strategy of cooperating in the next round (first action after depletion). This allows for a recovery phase.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, choose 'C' regardless of opponents' actions in the previous round, as payoff is determined by this round's consumption and remaining stock.
   - In case of a tie (multiple opponents choosing the same action), mimic the majority's choice or randomly select between them.
   - If there are no opponents left (single-player scenario), continue with the initial cooperative strategy.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy follows a reciprocal approach, fostering cooperation when it is returned and punishing defection. This encourages others to follow suit, promoting a collective mindset of mutual trust and fairness.
   - By adjusting its actions based on opponents' behavior, the ATFT strategy demonstrates adaptability and robustness in handling a wide range of opponent behaviors, making it an effective strategy for repeated interactions.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Growth (TFT-AG)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, players Cooperate (C). This is a peaceful start that encourages cooperation from opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, players analyze the opponent's behavior in previous rounds:
     - If the opponent has always Cooperated (C), players Cooperate as well to maintain the cooperative relationship.
     - If the opponent has defected (D) but the current stock level is above a predefined threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), players Cooperate, encouraging the opponent to change their behavior.
     - If the opponent has defected and the current stock level is below the threshold, players Defect as well, enforcing consequences for uncooperative opponents.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, players Defect since there will be no further rounds to reciprocate or punish.
   - If the opponent's behavior is not clear (e.g., missed moves or random actions), players default to Cooperating in the first instance as a peaceful approach. Subsequent decisions are based on the opponent's observed behavior from then on.

3. Be collective - Align with the collective mindset:

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) on the first round to show good faith and encourage cooperation. This is a one-time gesture that does not guarantee continued cooperation from other players.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the previous round's total consumption and adjust the action based on the following conditions:
       - If all players cooperated in the previous round (minimal total consumption), cooperate again to reinforce the cooperative behavior.
       - If any player defected, defect in the current round as a form of punishment for the previous defection. This encourages players to reconsider their actions and potentially return to cooperation in future rounds.
   - If the game reaches its last round, always cooperate since there is no opportunity for retaliation or reciprocity.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round (t=1), play C as a goodwill gesture.
   - In the last round (t=r), play C to maximize payoff even if others may have defected in previous rounds.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy aims to maintain a sustainable common pool by encouraging cooperation while also punishing defection. This promotes a collective mindset that values long-term sustainability over short-term gains.
   - By adjusting actions based on the previous round's total consumption, the strategy seeks to establish and reinforce cooperative norms among players over time.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATFT(round_num, previous_total_consumption):
  if round_num == 1:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In every round t, player i follows these rules to decide between Cooperating (C) and Defecting (D):
- First Round: Cooperation (C) as a goodwill gesture, setting the initial relationship on a positive note.
- Last Round: Player i will cooperate if the total stock is below a certain threshold to avoid depleting the resource entirely. Otherwise, defect to maximize payoff.
- Subsequent Rounds (t > 1): Player i observes the action of the opponent from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, player i will also cooperate. If the opponent defected, player i will defect as well. This behavior encourages reciprocation and builds trust when partners cooperate continuously.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT(t, r, stock, capacity, opponent_action_t-1):
    if t = 1 then
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif t = r then
        if stock < (capacity / n) then
            return 'C'  # Prevent depletion of resource at the end

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

The strategy addresses edge cases by considering the initial cooperation and strategic adjustments towards the end to avoid depleting resources while maximizing payoff when possible.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

ATfT is designed to work within a group by promoting reciprocity, building trust among players, and fostering a sense of cooperation. By encouraging other players to cooperate in return, the strategy aims to optimize the overall group payoff while also considering individual incentives. This approach balances the need for both collective success and individual benefit.

By following these principles, the ATfT strategy will perform well against various opponent behaviors while promoting cooperation and trust within the group.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Conservation (ASC) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate when the current stock level is above the critical point (Critical_point = (n+1)*capacity/2n). This encourages cooperation when the resource pool is abundant, as it benefits all players in the long run by preserving the resource for future rounds.
   - Defect when the current stock level is below or equal to the critical point. This promotes self-interest when the resource pool is scarce, ensuring that each player receives a reasonable payoff in the short term.
   - In case of a tie (i.e., Critical_point equals the remaining stock), the decision is left random, as it does not significantly impact the long-term collective outcome.

Pseudocode:
```
def decideAction(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    if stock <= criticalPoint:
        return "Defect"
    elif stock > criticalPoint:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        # In case of a tie, randomly decide between cooperating or defecting
        randomChoice = randint(0, 1)
        if randomChoice == 0:
            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return "Defect"
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, players will adopt a mixed strategy, as there is no historical data to base decisions on. This can be achieved by adding a random component when deciding actions in the initial rounds.
   - In the last round, players should prioritize stock conservation and cooperate to ensure that the resource pool does not deplete completely and may be available for future interactions.

Pseudocode:
```
def edgeCaseHandler(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    if round == 1:
        randomChoice = randint(0, 1)
        if randomChoice == 0:

        else:
            return "Defect"
    elif round == r:
        return "Cooperate"
```

3. Be collective:
   - The ASC strategy prioritizes the collective good by promoting cooperation when resources are abundant and focusing on individual payoffs when resources are scarce. This ensures a balance between long-term resource preservation and immediate self-interest.
   - By adapting to the current state of the common pool resource, the ASC strategy demonstrates a commitment to collective thinking and sustainability.

   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if the opponent defected, also defect. This strategy encourages cooperation while retaliating against defection to maintain a balance.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing individual payoff by adopting the opponent's action from the previous round, even if it resulted in defection. The goal is to obtain as much of the remaining stock as possible.
   - If the common pool resource depletes (stock = 0), adopt a random action for the following round since there will be no growth or stock depletion calculation. This can help revive cooperation when resources are replenished.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATfT strategy aims to build and maintain long-term mutual trust with other players by cooperating whenever possible while retaliating against defection. This encourages a collaborative environment where players understand the consequences of their actions on others and on future interactions.

Pseudocode for Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy:

```python
def ATfT(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C' # Cooperate in the first round
  else:
    last_opponent_action = get_last_opponent_action(round-1) # Function to obtain opponent's action from previous round
    action = last_opponent_action # Mimic opponent's action from the previous round

  consume_stock = determine_consumption(n, action) # Determine consumption based on action and number of players
  update_state(stock, consume_stock) # Update common pool resource state
  return action
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the stock level is above a threshold T_coop, which is a percentage of the maximum sustainable stock level (capacity). In this case, the decision rule can be expressed as:
     ```
     if stock >= T_coop * capacity then action = C
     else action = D
     ```
   - Defect (D) when the stock level is below T_defect, which is another percentage of the maximum sustainable stock level. The decision rule can be expressed as:
     ```
     if stock < T_defect * capacity then action = D
     else action = C
     ```
   - T_coop and T_defect are adjustable parameters that balance cooperation and defection, allowing the strategy to adapt to a wide range of opponent behaviours. Initially, they can be set to 0.6 (60%) for both cooperate and defect thresholds. These values may change during the game based on the evolution of the stock level and opponents' actions.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, since there is no prior history, the strategy will initially choose to cooperate (T_coop = T_defect = 0.6). This helps build trust with other players and encourages cooperation in the long run.
   - In the last round, the strategy should consider the current stock level and adjust its decision based on the decision rules mentioned above. If the stock is depleted (0), the strategy will defect to prevent further depletion. If there's still some stock left, the strategy will cooperate to preserve resources for future rounds if played.

3. Being Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy promotes collective mindset by cooperating in most situations, especially when resource levels are high or have been relatively stable. This encourages cooperation among players and sustains common pool resources over multiple rounds.
   - The adjustable thresholds T_coop and T_defect allow the strategy to adapt to various opponent behaviours, fostering collaboration when possible and retaliating against defection when necessary. This helps ensure a balance between individual and collective interests while maintaining long-term sustainability of shared resources.
   - In situations where opponents are not cooperative, the ATFT strategy can still achieve good payoffs through its adaptive nature. However, as the stock level approaches critical levels (e.g., near depletion), it may be beneficial to shift towards more conservative strategies that prioritize preserving resources over maximizing short-term gains.

description_COLLECTIVE_230 = '''
 For this Common Pool Resource Game, I'll propose a strategy named Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT). The strategy is designed to foster cooperation while being robust against various opponent behaviors.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initial round (t=1): Cooperate (C) as a gesture of goodwill and to encourage reciprocity among players.
   - Subsequent rounds (t > 1):
      - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round.
      - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round as a punishment for their selfish behavior. This tit-for-tat approach encourages cooperation by reciprocating it but punishing defection to discourage free riding.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round (t=r): Since we want to preserve the common pool resource, cooperate in the last round regardless of the opponent's previous action to ensure the maximum stock for future games.
   - First round (t=1): Cooperate as mentioned earlier.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy is designed to promote cooperation by encouraging other players to follow similar reciprocal behaviors, which can lead to a more sustainable usage of the common pool resource. However, since the strategy does not assume any coordination mechanisms or shared norms among opponents, it remains flexible and adaptive to different situations.

Pseudocode for Adaptive Tit-for-Tat:
```
function ATFT(opponent_action_history):
  if t == 1:
    return "C" (Cooperate)
  if opponent_action_history[-1] == "C":
    return "C" (Cooperate)
  else:
    return "D" (Defect)

function last_round(r, t):
  return t == r
```
This strategy balances cooperation and punishment, making it adaptive to a wide range of opponent behaviors while promoting the collective mindset of sustainably using the common pool resource.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-based Tit-for-Tat (AFTFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round i, evaluate the average consumption per player (ACi) up to round i-1 using the formula ACi = total consumption in rounds 1 through i-1 divided by (i-1).
   - If ACi < average capacity utilization (ACU), cooperate (C). If ACi > ACU, defect (D). The threshold ACU is set to ensure a sustainable common pool resource. In this strategy, ACU = 2n/3.
   - If ACi equals ACU, use the Tit-for-Tat (TFT) rule:
     - If a player has been cooperative in all previous rounds, cooperate (C).
     - If a player has defected in any of the previous rounds, defect (D).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), as no history is available to make a decision based on TFT.
   - In the last round, use the average consumption per player (ACr) up to round r-1 to decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the rules mentioned in point 1.

3. Be collective:
   - Align with the collective mindset by aiming for a sustainable common pool resource that benefits all players over the long term. The ACU parameter helps achieve this goal.
   - By using TFT as a fallback strategy when history is available, the AFTFT strategy encourages cooperation among players while also punishing defection to maintain the collective interest.

Pseudocode:

```python
def AFTFT(round, consumption_history, capacity, ACU):
  if round == 1:
    return "C" # Cooperate in the first round as no history is available

  ACr = sum(consumption_history) / (round - 1)

  if ACr < ACU:
    return "C" # Cooperate when average consumption per player is below the threshold

  if all(player_cooperated in consumption_history):
    return "C" # Tit-for-Tat: cooperate if every player has been cooperative so far

  return "D" # Tit-for-Tat: defect if any player has ever defected before
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Conservation (ARC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate when the current stock level is above the sustainable individual resource limit (SIRL), defined as n * capacity / (2n). This encourages conservation of resources for future rounds and cooperative behavior among players.
   - Defect when the current stock level falls below SIRL, to secure personal resources in case the common pool depletes further.
   - In borderline cases where the stock is exactly at SIRL, use a random decision to break ties, ensuring fairness and unpredictability for opponents.

2. Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Initially, players have no prior knowledge of other players' actions. They should cooperate in the first round as it represents an opportunity to conserve resources for later rounds when they can base their decisions on more information.
   - Last Round: Since there are no subsequent rounds, players will choose actions based solely on the current stock level. If the stock is above SIRL, cooperate; otherwise, defect to secure personal resources.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Emphasize resource conservation by prioritizing actions that maintain a sustainable common pool for future rounds.
   - Encourage cooperation by aligning individual decisions with the collective good, preserving the common pool for all players' benefit.
   - Maintain flexibility through random tie-breaking in borderline cases to avoid predictability and exploitation by opponents.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ARC(n, capacity, stock, r, round):
  SIRL = n * capacity / (2*n)

  if round == 1 or stock >= SIRL:
    action = "Cooperate"
  elif stock < SIRL:
    action = "Defect"
  else: # borderline case
    action = random_choice(["Cooperate", "Defect"])

  return action
```

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C), establishing trust and goodwill.
   - Subsequent Rounds (t>1): If opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate (C). Otherwise, defect (D) to penalize the opponent for their selfish behavior. This aims at fostering cooperation and punishing defection.

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Since payoffs are determined by the entire game, not just the last round, we will follow the same decision rules as in subsequent rounds.
   - First Encounter with an Opponent: As described above for initial rounds.

3. Collective Mindset:
   The Tit-for-Tat strategy embodies cooperation and fairness by adhering to a reciprocity principle, making it easier for other strategies to cooperate as well. By being responsive to the opponent's behavior, the strategy promotes a sense of mutual understanding and shared objectives.

Pseudocode:
```
function TitForTat(opponent_history):
  if t == 1:
    action = "C" (Cooperate)
  else:
    if opponent_history[t-1] == "C":
      action = "C" (Cooperate)
    else:
      action = "D" (Defect)
  return action

By implementing this strategy, the AI will be able to balance cooperation and competition in a way that encourages long-term success within the repeated common pool resource game.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, evaluate the historical average cooperation level of opponents (AverageCoop). If AverageCoop > 0.5, cooperate; otherwise defect. This encourages cooperation when others are also cooperating and retaliates against defection.
   - When encountering a new opponent in the first round or joining an ongoing game, initially cooperate to foster a cooperative environment (FairStart). If the opponent defects, switch to the tit-for-tat response (Retaliate).
   - In later rounds when stock is low (close to capacity limit), prioritize conserving resources and defect more frequently to ensure survival (ResourceConservation).

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - For the first round, follow FairStart as mentioned above.
   - For the last round, regardless of the historical cooperation level, cooperate to leave some resources for future games or if the current game is repeated (LastRoundCoop).

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a historical record of opponents' actions (History) and calculate AverageCoop using this data. This approach encourages cooperation with cooperative opponents while penalizing those who repeatedly defect.
   - In addition, the strategy includes the ResourceConservation rule to ensure sustainability of common resources in case other strategies do not prioritize conservation.

Pseudocode:

```
Initialize Strategy:
  r, n, capacity
  History[i][t] = 0 (represents opponent i's action in round t)
  AverageCoop[i] = 0
  CurrentRound = 1

In each round t for a player i:
  1. If CurrentRound == 1 then:
     - Set Action to Cooperate (FairStart)
     - Add Action to History[i][t]

  2. Else:
     - Calculate AverageCoop[i] from History[i]
       - If AverageCoop[i] > 0.5 then set Action to Cooperate (CooperateWhenOthersCooperate)
       - Otherwise set Action to Defect (Retaliate)
     - Add Action to History[i][t]
     - If Stock is low (ResourceConservation):
       - If CurrentRound != r then set Action to Defect

At the end of each round:
  1. Update stocks and grow the common pool as per game structure

Endgame or End of Rounds:
  1. In the last round, regardless of AverageCoop, set Action to Cooperate (LastRoundCoop)
```

description_COLLECTIVE_235 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), demonstrating trust and goodwill towards other players.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the average cooperation level of all opponents in the previous t-1 rounds (t > 1). If this average is above a predefined Cooperation Threshold (CT), cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - To maintain adaptability, CT increases linearly with the number of players and rounds: CT = α * n + β * r, where α and β are positive constants that control the strictness of cooperation criteria.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if opponents' average cooperation level is above CT; otherwise, defect to maximize immediate payoff.
   - In case of no previous rounds (t=1), always cooperate as a gesture of goodwill.

3. Being Collective:
   - The strategy emphasizes fairness and reciprocity, encouraging cooperation when others are cooperative and adopting a defensive stance when facing defection.
   - By adapting the CT to the game parameters and opponents' behavior, TFT-ACT aims to foster a sustainable common pool resource environment that balances short-term gains with long-term cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_ACT(n, r, capacity, alpha, beta):
    stock = capacity
    history = []  # store previous opponents' actions
    CT = alpha * n + beta * r

    def decide_action(history):
        avg_coop = sum(1 for action in history if action == "C") / len(history)
        return "C" if avg_coop > CT else "D"

    for t in range(1, r+1):
        action = decide_action(history[-t:])  # take action based on the last t rounds
        payoff = stock / (2 * n) if action == "C" else stock / n  # calculate payoff
        stock -= action == "D" * stock / n  # update stock after consumption

        # update history and check for edge cases
        history.append(action)
        if t == r or avg_coop <= CT and action != "C":  # last round or strategy shift
            break
    return payoff * t  # calculate total game payoff
```

description_COLLECTIVE_236 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Conservation Strategy (ASC-S)

1. Specify decision rules:
   ASC-S uses a combination of short-term and long-term considerations to decide between cooperating (C) or defecting (D).

   Short-term strategy: Prioritize conservation in the current round if the stock level is below the average sustainable stock per player (average_stock = capacity / n). This promotes cooperation when the common pool resource is scarce.
   Long-term strategy: Consider the growth potential of the common pool and the impact on future generations, encouraging long-term cooperation. If the remaining stock multiplied by the growth factor exceeds the average_stock, choose C; otherwise, choose D. The growth factor is calculated as 2 * (1 - S / capacity).

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function decideAction(i, S):
       if S < average_stock:
           return "C"
       else if S * (2 * (1 - S / capacity)) >= average_stock:
           return "C"
       else:
           return "D"
   ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   First round: Considering the growth factor is undefined for the initial state, prioritize conservation and choose C in the first round.
   Last round: As the game ends after r rounds, the long-term strategy doesn't apply in the last round. Therefore, ASC-S will always defect in the last round to maximize personal payoff.

3. Be collective: By focusing on the sustainable use of common resources and their growth potential, ASC-S promotes a mindset that balances immediate rewards with long-term sustainability and collective wellbeing.

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C), setting a tone of mutual cooperation and fostering trust.
   - For subsequent rounds, adopt the Tit-for-Tat (TFT) approach: if an opponent cooperates, reciprocate with cooperation; if they defect, respond by defecting in the next round. This encourages ongoing cooperation while also being resilient against occasional defections.
   - If an opponent consistently defects (i.e., more than 50% of the time), reconsider cooperating as a losing strategy and switch to defecting to prevent excessive stock depletion. However, if the opponent subsequently switches to cooperating, return to the TFT approach. This makes the strategy flexible and adaptive in the long run.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since the game ends anyway, cooperate regardless of previous actions.
   - In the first round, as mentioned above, cooperate (C).

3. Be Collective:
   - This strategy prioritizes collective well-being by promoting cooperation whenever possible but being prepared to adapt and respond when necessary. The goal is not only to maximize individual payoff but also to maintain a sustainable common pool resource for all players in the long run.

Pseudocode (in Python):

```python
def ATFT(opponent_history, n, r, capacity, stock):
  history_len = len(opponent_history)
  if history_len == 0:
    action = 'C'  # Initial cooperation
  elif history_len < r and opponent_history[-1] == 'D':
    action = 'D'  # Defect to encourage reciprocation
  elif history_len >= r or (history_len > 0 and opponent_history[-1] == 'C'):
    action = opponent_history[-2] if opponent_history[-2] is not None else 'C'  # TFT or initial cooperation
  else:  # If opponent consistently defects, switch to defection but return to cooperation if they change
    if sum(opponent_history[-r:]) / r > 0.5:
      action = 'D'
    elif history_len - r < r and opponent_history[-1] == 'C':
      action = 'C'
  return action
```

description_COLLECTIVE_238 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to provide a positive starting point for collaboration and establish trust among players (C).
   - If another player cooperates in the current round, cooperate as well (C). This follows the Tit-for-Tat strategy from game theory.
   - If another player defects, also defect in the current round but adjust the stock consumption based on the current stock level and capacity. If the stock is less than or equal to 2n/3 of the capacity, consume stock/(2n) (C). Otherwise, consume stock/n (D). This adaptation allows for a more conservative approach when the resource is scarce.
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of other players' actions to maximize the final payoff (C).

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In case of tie between multiple players cooperating and defecting, follow the majority vote rule. If there is no majority, continue with the previous action taken.
   - If another player deviates from the Tit-for-Tat pattern, revert to the initial cooperation (C) in the next round to give them another chance. However, if they continue to defect, follow the stock adaptation rule as described earlier.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Prioritize sustainable resource management by following the stock adaptation rule when the common pool is scarce.
   - Foster cooperation by mimicking other players' actions and rebuilding trust after deviations, but be firm on the stock conservation principle.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfTSA(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1: # First Round
    action = 'C'
  else:
    last_action = previous_rounds[-1] # Get the previous round's action

    if all(player[last_round] == 'C' for player in players) and stock >= (2 * n * capacity) // 3: # Everyone cooperated and resource is abundant
      action = 'C' # Cooperate
    elif all(player[last_round] == 'D' for player in players) or stock <= (2 * n * capacity) // 3: # Everyone defected or resource is scarce
      action = 'D' # Defect
    else: # Mixed strategies or neither extreme, follow Tit-for-Tat but with stock adaptation
      action = last_action

  return action
```

This strategy aims to balance cooperation and self-interest while promoting sustainability in the common pool resource game. By following a cooperative approach with stock conservation principles, it fosters a collective mindset that promotes long-term resource management and encourages sustainable growth over exploitation.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (Tftt-G) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to initiate a cooperative environment and allow the stock to grow.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's last action (C or D). If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate. If not, defect. This maintains cooperation when it exists but retaliates against defection.
   - Adaptation: In case of a stock depletion (0), restart with cooperating in the following round to allow the stock to grow again.

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: If the game is at its final round, do not retaliate against an opponent's defection as there will be no more rounds for reciprocation.
   - Initial Stock Depletion: Upon encountering a depleted stock (0), cooperate to encourage growth and start fresh.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy promotes cooperation by encouraging players to collaborate when their opponents are cooperative while also punishing defection with retaliation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate (C). This initial act of cooperation sets a peaceful tone for the game and allows for potential long-term cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1):
      - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C) in the current round to maintain the cooperation.
      - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round as a punishment for defection, but revert to cooperating if they switch to cooperation in the next round. This encourages opponents to reciprocate cooperation while also punishing defections.
   - To account for unresponsive or irrational opponents, introduce a forgiveness mechanism: If an opponent defected previously but has been cooperating for consecutive rounds (x), then cooperate starting from the current round (t+x). This allows for opportunities to rebuild trust with potential partners.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), cooperate (C) since no more rounds will follow, and any stock left is beneficial.
   - If an opponent defected in the final round, do not retaliate as the game has already ended.
   - If an opponent did not cooperate by the forgiveness mechanism's threshold (x), consider them unresponsive and revert to the default strategy of always defecting against them.
   - In the initial rounds where no history exists, cooperate (C). This gives opponents a chance to reciprocate cooperation.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Prioritize long-term sustainability by preserving the common pool as much as possible while also encouraging cooperation with other players.
   - Emphasize adaptiveness and flexibility to accommodate various opponent behaviors, adapting strategy based on past interactions with opponents.
   - Encourage a cooperative culture by rewarding cooperation and punishing defections in a fair and consistent manner.

     a. If the common pool resource was depleted in the previous round, play D to contribute to recovering the resource (avoid overexploitation).
     b. If the opponent played D in the previous round, also play D as a retaliation mechanism (tit-for-tat). This encourages cooperation if opponents cooperate and punishes defection.
     c. In the first round, play C to initiate cooperation and display a willingness to collaborate (foster trust).

Pseudocode:
```python
def decide_action(history):
  if len(history) == 0: # First round

  if opponent_action == 'D': # Opponent defected in previous round
    return 'D'
  else: # Cooperate to encourage future cooperation
    return 'C'
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, play C regardless of the current state or opponent's action as there are no more subsequent rounds to maintain cooperation or retaliate.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes the common good by cooperating to conserve resources and recovering from overexploitation (avoidance of depletion). It also responds to defection with retaliation to discourage further exploitation while still promoting cooperation. The strategy maintains a balance between self-interest and collective interest, making it collectively minded.

The TFTA strategy aims for sustainable resource management and is adaptive to various opponent behaviors by combining cooperation and punishment mechanisms in a simple yet robust manner.

     a) If opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), then cooperate ("tit").
     b) If opponent defected in the previous round (t-1), then also defect ("tat") to punish them for not cooperating.
   - To encourage long-term cooperation and adapt to changing opponent behavior, a forgiveness mechanism is introduced: if an opponent who previously defected starts cooperating again, switch back to cooperating yourself ("tit").

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), cooperate regardless of the previous action of the opponent, since there are no further rounds for punishment or rewards.
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate as mentioned earlier.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - TfT-AC aims to foster a stable cooperation environment by mimicking trustworthy behavior and punishing defection, while still allowing for forgiveness in case of repeated cooperation from opponents. This collective mindset encourages mutual understanding and long-term stability among players.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_AC(opponent_history, r, n, capacity):
    state = capacity
    strategy = {}

    def cooperate():
        return "C"

    def defect():

    strategy["first_round"] = cooperate()

    for t in range(2, r+1):
        if opponent_history[t-1] == strategy[t-1]:  # If same action as previous round, cooperate
            strategy[t] = cooperate()
        else:                                      # If different action than previous round, defect
            strategy[t] = defect()

    for t in range(2, r):
        if opponent_history[t] == cooperate():   # If opponent cooperated this round, forgive and cooperate next round
            strategy[t+1] = cooperate()

    strategy[r] = cooperate()                     # In the last round, always cooperate

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFt) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate to show a willingness to build trust and contribute positively to the group.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate actions based on historical behavior of opponents:
       - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (i.e., reciprocate cooperation).
       - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (i.e., punish defection).
   - This strategy encourages long-term cooperation and discourages exploitation while being flexible enough to adapt to various opponent behaviors.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, always cooperate as previously mentioned.
   - In the last round, cooperate if the current stock level is above a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of the capacity) to encourage cooperation for future games. Otherwise, defect to ensure a fair distribution of resources when the game ends and the stock cannot recover.
   - For other edge cases (e.g., the opponent suddenly changes strategy mid-game), maintain the same decision rules but update the historical behavior record accordingly.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Prioritize maintaining a healthy common pool resource for future generations by striking a balance between immediate gains and long-term sustainability.
   - Foster cooperation among players by reciprocating cooperative actions and punishing defection, promoting mutual trust and beneficial outcomes for all involved parties.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Evolutionary Strategy (TFT-ES) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In every round i (except the first), the player cooperates if the average stock consumption of the previous t rounds (t = 1 to i) is below a threshold T, and defects otherwise. The threshold T is set as the mean consumption in the first t rounds multiplied by a tolerance factor. This rule promotes cooperation when resources are sustainably managed and retaliates against overconsumption with defection.
   - In the first round, the player cooperates to contribute positively to the common good.

Pseudocode:
```
function get_average_consumption(history):
    total_consumption = 0
    if history is empty:
        return 0
    for consumption in history:
        total_consumption += consumption
    return total_consumption / len(history)

function TFT_ES_decision(current_stock, consumption_history, threshold, tolerance):
    average_consumption = get_average_consumption(consumption_history)
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'Cooperate'
    if average_consumption <= threshold * (1 + tolerance):
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, the player cooperates regardless of the history to maximize payoff for that round.
   - If the current stock is zero, the player defects to avoid negative payoffs since the game structure does not allow stock to go below zero.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy encourages cooperation when others are also cooperating and retaliates with defection against overconsumption in order to promote sustainable resource management.
   - The tolerance factor can be adjusted based on a collective understanding of the ideal sustainability level for the common pool resource game, encouraging long-term collaboration among players.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, players should cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows for stock growth in subsequent rounds.
   - For each subsequent round, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, the player also cooperates. If the opponent defected, the player will defect in retaliation. This encourages mutual cooperation when it occurs and punishes defection.
   - To avoid excessive stock depletion due to repeated retaliation, players should revert to cooperating after a certain number of defects from the opponent (called "forgiveness period"). The forgiveness period increases with the remaining stock capacity to promote recovery and long-term cooperation.
   - If the stock level is below 50% of the maximum sustainable stock level (2n), players should always cooperate regardless of their opponents' previous actions, as low stocks necessitate conservation.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFTA(opponent_action, round, capacity, n, forgiveness_period=5):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    if opponent_action == 'C':
        if stock > capacity/2 and (round - forgiveness_period) > forgiveness_period:
            return 'D'  # Defect if opponent cooperated but forgiveness period has been exceeded or stock is above 50% of capacity
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated and stock is below 50% of capacity or forgiveness period not yet exceeded
    else:
        if stock > capacity/2 and (round - forgiveness_period) > forgiveness_period:
            return 'D'  # Defect if opponent defected but forgiveness period has been exceeded or stock is above 50% of capacity
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent defected and stock is below 50% of capacity or forgiveness period not yet exceeded
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, players should cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions to maximize their total payoff in the game.
   - If an opponent defects consistently, players may need to adjust their forgiveness period or even consider permanent retaliation (increasing the forgiveness period threshold). This can help protect against exploitation by uncooperative opponents while preserving the potential for future cooperation.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - TFTA maintains a balance between cooperation and punishment, encouraging mutual cooperation when it occurs but also punishing defection to deter long-term depletion of the common pool resource.
   - By adjusting the forgiveness period based on stock levels, players prioritize resource conservation and long-term sustainability. This promotes collective interests by fostering an environment conducive to growth and recovery.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TFT-GA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to start with a positive relationship and set the tone for future interactions.
   - Subsequent rounds: If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back. If not, defect to punish the opponent. However, take into account stock growth from the previous round's remnant.
     - If the total consumption was less than 80% of the current stock (stock after consumption), consider cooperating as the growth factor is likely to replenish the stock for future rounds.
     - If the total consumption was equal to or more than 80% of the current stock, defect to ensure a minimal stock level for future survival and encourage opponents to cooperate to preserve the common pool resource.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize preserving the remaining stock over payoff maximization due to the game's dynamic state. Cooperate if the total consumption would result in a significant depletion of the stock (e.g., more than 90%). Otherwise, defect if necessary to maintain the minimal stock level.
   - In the first round, defect if the opponent defected in their previous encounter with another player (assuming repeated games within the tournament). This is a punishment mechanism for those who might have shown an aggressive strategy in the past.

3. Be Collective:
   - Prioritize maintaining a sustainable common pool resource to ensure long-term survival and cooperation among all players.
   - Adapt to opponents' strategies while keeping the collective mindset in mind, focusing on preserving the stock level for future interactions within the tournament.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Forgiveness (TFT-AF)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate to start on a positive note and encourage cooperation from other players.
   - From round 2 until the last round, analyze your opponent's behavior in the previous round and decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the following rules:
      - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in this round (returning the favor).
      - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in this round (punishing the defection).
      - Implement forgiveness by considering a certain number (F) of consecutive defections as a single "mistake" before starting to retaliate. Set F equal to half the number of rounds (r/2) or a fixed value if r is not known in advance.
      - If the opponent has made fewer than F defections, continue to cooperate. After F defections, defect until the opponent shows a willingness to cooperate again, at which point return to cooperation.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), cooperate regardless of previous actions by opponents, as there are no further rounds for retaliation or forgiveness.
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate as mentioned earlier.

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain a record of your own actions and the actions of each opponent to make informed decisions based on the history of the game.
   - Encourage cooperation by responding positively to cooperative behavior, while also being resilient against defection by implementing forgiveness.
   - By following these rules, the strategy aligns with a collective mindset as it seeks stable and cooperative outcomes when possible, while still remaining robust to various opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:

 Title: Titan Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock level is above the critical threshold (CT), calculated as (capacity * n * (n-1)) / ((2 * r) * n). This encourages cooperation when the total sustainable stock is greater than what would be depleted over r rounds.
   - Defect (D) when the current stock level is at or below the CT. This enforces conservation when the common pool is approaching depletion.

2. Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate regardless of the initial stock level, as it hasn't been affected by previous actions yet.
   - Last Round: Defect if the current stock level is above the CT; cooperate otherwise, to preserve resources for future rounds (if any).

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy prioritizes long-term sustainability over immediate gains. It encourages a balance between cooperation and competition, adjusting actions based on the current state and game parameters.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Conservation (ASC) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, calculate the average consumption per player (AverageConsumption) up to the current round.
   - If AverageConsumption is less than or equal to (capacity / 2n), choose "Cooperate" (C). Otherwise, choose "Defect" (D). This rule encourages conservation when resources are plentiful but allows for consumption when resources become scarce.

Pseudocode:
```
function ASC(r, n, capacity, stock, history):
  if round = 1:
    return random choice between C and D

  AverageConsumption = sum(history)/rounds
  if AverageConsumption <= (capacity / (2*n)):
    return "Cooperate"
  else:
    return "Defect"
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, players should choose a random action to account for uncertainty and unpredictability.
   - In the last round, players can consider the remaining stock level and apply the decision rule as described above.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy aims to balance resource consumption between all players by conserving resources when possible and adjusting consumption based on the average consumption rate. This collective mindset fosters a sense of fairness among the players, incentivizing long-term sustainability over short-term gains.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate to establish a peaceful and collaborative atmosphere.
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1):
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), cooperate in the current round (t). This reciprocates the cooperation from the opponent.
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round (t-1), also defect in the current round (t). This enforces a punishment for defection and encourages cooperation moving forward.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - First round (t=1): Cooperate as described above.
   - Last round (t=r): Since the payoff depends on the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds, it is essential to consider the history of past actions. If the opponent has cooperated in most previous rounds, cooperate in the final round to maintain a cooperative relationship and potentially receive a higher payoff. Otherwise, defect to teach the opponent a lesson and deter future defections.
   - Intermediate rounds: Follow the Tit-for-Tat strategy as described above.

3. Collective mindset:
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy promotes cooperation by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defection, fostering a collective mentality among players. By encouraging mutual trust and forgiveness, this strategy can lead to long-term collaboration and sustainable resource management.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tit_for_tat(player_i, opponent, round_num, history):
  if round_num == 1:
    return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

  last_round = history[-1]  # Get the action of the last round

  if last_round == "C":  # If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate now
    return "C"
  else:  # If opponent defected in the previous round, also defect now

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, TFT-SA starts by cooperating if it's the first round or the opponent has cooperated in the previous round. If the opponent defected in the previous round, TFT-SA will also defect in this round as a response. However, the strategy adapts to the stock level:

- If the stock level is less than a threshold (Stock Threshold), TFT-SA will always defect to prevent rapid depletion of the common pool resource.
- If the stock level is above the Stock Threshold, TFT-SA will cooperate if the opponent also cooperated in the previous round. Otherwise, it will defect as a punishment for defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, all players start by cooperating due to the simultaneous-move nature of the game. For the last round, TFT-SA will continue with its current decision rule as there are no subsequent rounds.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

TFT-SA aims to maintain a sustainable stock level for the common pool while also considering the opponents' actions. By punishing defection and cooperating in response, the strategy encourages long-term cooperation and prevents rapid depletion of the resource. TFT-SA can be seen as a collective mindset that values mutual trust and fairness.

Pseudocode for TFT-SA:

```python
class TitForTatWithStockAdaptation:
    def __init__(self, stock_threshold):
        self.stock_threshold = stock_threshold
        self.opponent_history = []  # stores the opponent's previous actions

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Sharing (ARS)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   The ARS strategy employs a Tit-for-Tat (TFT) approach with adaptations based on the current and accumulated resource levels.

   For each player i in round t, if stock > (2n/3) * capacity:
       - Cooperate if the number of cooperators in the previous round is greater than or equal to n/2 (promote cooperation when resources are abundant).
       - Defect otherwise (punish over-exploitation).

   For each player i in round t, if stock ≤ (2n/3) * capacity:
       - Cooperate if the number of cooperators in the previous round is less than or equal to n/2 (promote conservation when resources are scarce).
       - Defect otherwise (punish under-exploitation).

   This rule allows the strategy to balance cooperation and defection based on the available resource level.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the initial round, players should cooperate as there is no previous information to base decisions on.

   In the final round, players should focus on accumulating as much of the remaining resources as possible, regardless of previous actions (i.e., defect).

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   The ARS strategy promotes a cooperative approach, but it also includes checks to prevent excessive exploitation or conservation of resources when necessary. By doing so, it fosters a balance between self-interest and collective well-being within the group. This helps ensure the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ARS_strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, round, history):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the initial round

    num_cooperators = count_cooperators(history)
    if round == r or stock <= (2 * n / 3) * capacity:
        return "D"  # Defect in the final round and when resources are scarce

    if num_cooperators > n / 2 and stock > (2 * n / 3) * capacity:
        return "C"  # Cooperate when resources are abundant and majority cooperated last round
    elif num_cooperators <= n / 2 or stock <= (2 * n / 3) * capacity:
        return "D"  # Defect when resources are scarce or over-exploited last round

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFTAT) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round i, the TFTAT strategy initially cooperates (plays C).
   - If the strategy's payoff in the previous round was less than the Cooperative Threshold (CT), it will defect (play D) in the current round. Otherwise, it will continue to cooperate. The CT is a dynamic value that adjusts based on the current round and the average payoff over the last few rounds.
   - After defecting, the strategy will revert to cooperating once the payoff in the subsequent round exceeds the CT again. This creates a forgiving approach that encourages opponents to return to cooperation after deviations.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TFTAT always cooperates as there is no previous history.
   - In the last round (r), if the strategy's average payoff over the game is below the CT, it will defect to ensure a minimum payoff. Otherwise, it continues to cooperate.

3. Be collective:
   - TFTAT's primary goal is to maintain a stable common pool for all players. By being adaptive and forgiving, it encourages cooperation while still protecting its own interests when necessary. This aligns with a collective mindset by seeking long-term sustainability rather than immediate gains at the expense of others.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFTAT(n, r, capacity, initial_stock):
    current_round = 1
    CT = capacity / (2 * n)
    payoffs = []  # Store payoffs for averaging
    stock = initial_stock

    while current_round <= r:
        action = 'C' if average_payoff() >= CT else 'D'
        stock -= action_consumption(action, n, stock)
        new_stock = stock + growth(stock, capacity)
        stock = min(new_stock, capacity)

        payoffs.append((stock / (2 * n)) if action == 'C' else (stock / n))
        current_round += 1
        CT = adaptive_CT(current_round, payoffs)

    # In the last round, consider defecting if average payoff is below CT
    if average_payoff() < CT:
        action = 'D'
        stock -= action_consumption(action, n, stock)

    return payoffs, current_round

def adaptive_CT(current_round, payoffs):
    # Adjust CT based on current round and average payoff over the last few rounds (e.g., 10 periods)
    ...

def action_consumption(action, n, stock):
    if action == 'C':
        return stock / (2 * n)
    elif action == 'D':
        return stock / n

def growth(stock, capacity):
    # Calculate the growth factor as defined in the game specification
    ...

The TFTAT strategy combines cooperation with a forgiving approach, making it adaptive and robust to various opponent behaviors. Its collective mindset aims to maintain a stable common pool for all players.

description_COLLECTIVE_262 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Conservation (ARC) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, calculate the average consumption per player over all previous rounds (excluding the current one). This value represents the long-term sustainability of the common pool.
   - If the average consumption is less than or equal to capacity/(2n), the strategy cooperates, reducing its short-term payoff but preserving the long-term well-being of the resource.
   - If the average consumption exceeds capacity/(2n), the strategy defects to maximize its immediate payoff, as it perceives that the resource is being overexploited and may soon collapse.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, the strategy has no history, so it will defect since there's no guarantee of sustainability.
   - In the last round (r), the strategy might act based on the average consumption from the previous r-1 rounds. However, as the game is repeated, the strategy should adapt its long-term view of resource sustainability throughout the tournament.

3. Being Collective:
   - The ARC Strategy seeks to preserve the common pool for future rounds while adapting to the behavior of other players. It aligns with a collective mindset by promoting responsible consumption and striving for sustainable resource management.

Pseudocode:

```
function ARC_Strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, round) {
  if (round == 1) return 'Defect' // First round, no history

  total_consumption = 0;
  for (i = 1; i < round; i++) {

description_COLLECTIVE_263 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Management (ASM)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, the ASM player calculates the average consumption per player (AverageCPP) and the remaining stock level relative to the capacity (RelativeStockLevel).
   - If AverageCPP is less than or equal to (capacity / (2n)) AND RelativeStockLevel >= 1, the player chooses 'C' (Cooperate).
   - If either of these conditions are not met, the player chooses 'D' (Defect) to preserve resources.

```
function ASM(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    AverageCPP = stock / n
    RelativeStockLevel = stock / capacity

    if (AverageCPP <= capacity / (2 * n)) and (RelativeStockLevel >= 1):
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, the player chooses 'C' as there is no history or past information to consider.
   - In the last round (r), if the remaining stock level is close to depletion (below a certain threshold), the player chooses 'D' to preserve resources for future generations. If not, the player follows the standard decision rules.

```
if (round = r):
    if (stock < capacity * depletion_threshold):
        return 'D'
    else:
        return ASM(n, r, capacity, stock, round)

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ASM strategy aims to maintain a sustainable level of resources for the common good while being mindful of the potential depletion in later rounds. It encourages cooperation when the resource pool is healthy and discourages overconsumption when resources are scarce.
   - By considering both the average consumption per player and the remaining stock level, ASM promotes a collective approach to decision-making that prioritizes long-term preservation of resources while balancing immediate needs.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C). This is a peace offering to other players and sets a cooperative tone. `if round = 1 then action = 'C'`
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's behavior from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect. This fosters cooperation when it is reciprocated but punishes defection. `if last_round_opponent_action == 'C' then action = 'C', else action = 'D'`
   - To avoid trapping oneself in a cycle of defection, if the opponent has been consistently defecting for a certain number (T) of rounds, switch to cooperation. This is an attempt to re-establish cooperation. `if opponent_defects_counter >= T then action = 'C'`
   - Gradually lower the threshold (T) for switching back to cooperation as the stock gets lower. This encourages opponents to cooperate when resources are scarce. `T = max(capacity - stock, 1)`

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, consider the accumulated payoff over all rounds and prioritize a higher payoff. If one's payoff is significantly lower than others', defect to attempt to catch up. `if total_payoff < (r/n) * average_total_payoff then action = 'D'`
   - In the final moments of the game, when stock becomes depleted and growth is minimal, it may be beneficial for all players to coordinate on cooperating to maximize their payoffs. To encourage this coordination, switch back to always cooperating once the stock falls below a certain threshold (S). `if stock < S then action = 'C'`

   - Strive for cooperation and fairness among all players by taking into account the overall resource state and average payoffs. This fosters a collective mindset of shared interests and sustainability.

 In this Common Pool Resource Game, we'll design a robust and adaptive strategy called "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Growth Factor" (ATFG). The goal is to encourage cooperation while being resilient against various opponent behaviors.

1. Decision rules:
   - Start cooperative: Begin the game by cooperating in the first round (C). This allows for opportunities to establish mutual cooperation.
   - Cooperate if opponents cooperate: If the majority of players cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C) in the current round.
     Pseudocode: If (number_of_cooperators > (n-1)) in previous round, then play C.
   - Defect if opponents defect: If the majority of players defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round. This serves as a punishment for uncooperative behavior.
     Pseudocode: If (number_of_defectors > (n-1)) in previous round, then play D.
   - Cooperate when stock is low and opponents cooperated: When the common pool resource is depleting quickly, cooperate (C) to help restore it, as long as most players cooperated in the previous round.
     Pseudocode: If (stock < threshold) AND (number_of_cooperators > (n-1)) in previous round, then play C. [Thresholds can be determined experimentally.]
   - Cooperate when stock growth is low and opponents cooperated: When the common pool resource isn't growing significantly despite cooperation, cooperate (C) to encourage a more aggressive approach towards restoring it.
     Pseudocode: If (stock_growth < threshold2) AND (number_of_cooperators > (n-1)) in previous round, then play C. [Thresholds can be determined experimentally.]

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: Cooperate (C). This encourages cooperation from the start.
   - Last round: Cooperate if total payoff for the game is positive (the common pool resource hasn't been depleted entirely), otherwise defect (D). This decision aims to maximize overall gains during the last opportunity.
     Pseudocode: If ((total_payoff > 0) AND (number_of_cooperators > (n-1))) in current round, then play C. Otherwise, play D.

3. Be collective: Maintain a balance between self-interest and collective interest by cooperating when doing so supports the sustainability of the common pool resource, encourages cooperation from opponents, or helps restore the resource when it's depleting quickly. By combining these conditions, ATFG fosters a collaborative mindset while adapting to various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_267 = '''
 For the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy named Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT). The ATFT strategy is inspired by the classic Tit-for-Tat strategy in game theory but with adaptations to handle the dynamic nature of this game.

1. Decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to signal a peaceful intent and build trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C) as a reward for cooperation.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, also defect (D) to punish the defection but return to cooperation in the following round if they switch back to cooperating.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no future rounds for retaliation or reward, always cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action.
   - In the first round, if all opponents also cooperate, a cooperative cycle is initiated and maintained throughout the game. If any opponent defects, the strategy will respond with defection in that round and potentially resume cooperation afterwards.

3. Collective mindset:
   - ATFT strategy encourages a collective approach by promoting cooperation as the default action and punishing defections only when necessary for self-preservation. This helps to maintain a relatively stable common pool resource level over time while still allowing for adaptability in response to other strategies.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFT(opponent_actions, round, r):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C" # Cooperate in the first round

  else:
    if opponent_action[round-1] == "C": # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
      action = "C"
    elif opponent_action[round-1] == "D": # Defect if opponent defected last round
      action = "D"
      previous_defection = True
    else:
      # Handle cases where opponent's previous action is unknown or ambiguous
      if round == r: # Last round, always cooperate regardless of opponent's action
        action = "C"
      else: # Maintain the cycle by returning to cooperation in the following round
        action = "C"
        previous_defection = False

  return action, previous_defection
```

This strategy strikes a balance between cooperation and retaliation, promoting collective resource preservation while still being adaptive to various opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules (Cooperate vs Defect):
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C) to show goodwill and foster trust, as initial actions set the tone for future interactions. Pseudocode: `if t == 1 then action = 'C' else continue with step 2`.
   - Subsequent Rounds: Adapt behavior based on opponent's previous move in the last round. If the opponent cooperated, cooperate; if they defected, defect. Pseudocode: `if opponent_action[t-1] == 'C' then action = 'C' else action = 'D'`
   - Tit-for-Tat (TFT) variation to encourage cooperation: In case of defection, return to cooperating after one round of retaliation. Pseudocode: `if opponent_action[t] == 'D' then next_action = 'D'; else next_action = opponent_action[t-1]`

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Since the game is finite, there is no need for additional consideration in this scenario since the opponents will also know it's the last round and should behave accordingly.
   - First Few Rounds: The ATFT strategy is robust and does not require any special considerations for the first few rounds due to its adaptive nature.

3. Be Collective:
   - By following a simple set of decision rules that emphasize cooperative behavior unless provoked, the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy aims to foster cooperation among players, encouraging the common good by promoting sustainable resource management.
   - The strategy aligns with the collective mindset as it fosters mutual cooperation and trust while being adaptive to various opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, the ATFT strategy starts by cooperating (C). This encourages reciprocal behavior and fosters a collective mindset.
   - If another player defects (D), the ATFT will also defect in the next round. This punishes defection and encourages cooperation. However, if the previous round was the first one or a player has just cooperated after a string of defections, the ATFT will continue to cooperate.
   - If all other players have consistently cooperated in the past few rounds, the ATFT will also cooperate. This rewards cooperative behavior and helps maintain a sustainable stock level.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, every player, including the ATFT, starts by cooperating (C).
   - During the last round, if the current stock is insufficient to sustain all players for one more round or the capacity has been reached, every player should defect to ensure their survival. The ATFT will follow this rule as well.
   - If the game restarts after reaching zero stock or capacity, each player returns to cooperating (C) in the first round as part of the strategy's reset mechanism.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATFT strategy emphasizes a collective mindset by promoting cooperation and punishing defection when appropriate. It encourages players to work together towards maintaining a sustainable stock level for future rounds.
   - If other players adopt similar strategies, the ATFT can establish a stable pattern of cooperation and mutual benefits over time.

Pseudocode:
```
def ATFT_Strategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock, round, past_rounds=[]):
  if round == 1 or len(past_rounds) == 0:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round and when there's no history

  else:
    if all players in past_rounds cooperated (or last defection is more than k rounds ago):
      action = 'C'
    elif current_stock < capacity / n or len(past_rounds) > r - k and all players in past_rounds defected:
      action = 'D'  # Defect to ensure survival when the stock is low
    else:
      action = past_rounds[-1] if past_rounds[-1] == 'C' else 'D'  # Mimic other players' last actions

  return action
```
In this pseudocode, `k` can be a user-defined parameter to determine how far back in the history we should look for cooperative or defective behavior. The larger k, the more forgiving the strategy will be towards occasional defections.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round i, cooperate if the average stock depletion (ASD) from the last h rounds (history window size h > 0) is less than a threshold T, defined as follows:
     ```
     ASD = (sum(stock_depletion_previous_h_rounds) / h)
     If ASD < T, cooperate; else defect.
     ```
   - Initially, set T = 0.5 and gradually adjust it based on the average cooperation rate (CR) of opponents over the past k rounds (memory window size k > 0):
     ```
     CR = (number_of_cooperation_from_opponents_in_previous_k_rounds / k)
     Update T according to CR using a sigmoid function:
     T = 0.5 + (0.5 * sigmoid(CR - CR_mean))
     where CR_mean is the mean cooperation rate of all opponents in previous games.
     ```
   - In the first round, cooperate as there's no history to consider and set T=0.5 for simplicity.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if the ASD from the h rounds before the last round is less than the current T value. This ensures a positive relationship with opponents who have behaved cooperatively over time.

3. Be Collective:
   - By adjusting the cooperation threshold (T) based on the average cooperation rate of opponents, the strategy aims to align with the collective mindset while maintaining robustness against various opponent behaviors.
   - The strategy fosters a reciprocal relationship and encourages cooperation when others cooperate while being less vulnerable to defection in the long run.

   - If the average consumption per player exceeds the sustainable level, defect (D) to ensure one's own survival and maintain a competitive edge.
   - In case of a tie or no data for 'k' rounds, use a random selection between cooperate and defect.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Since there is no historical data, randomly choose between cooperation and defection.
   - Last Round: If the common pool resource is depleted (stock = 0), defect to ensure survival. If stock is greater than zero, cooperate to help conserve the remaining resources.
   - Transition Periods: During periods where players shift from a state of over-exploitation to conservation or vice versa, ASMS will gradually adjust its actions towards cooperation or defection based on the average consumption trend over the last 'k' rounds.

 Title: Fitness-driven Adaptive Strategy (FADS) for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   FADS will employ a fitness-based approach to decide whether to cooperate or defect in each round. The fitness of a player i at round t is calculated as their average payoff over the previous 'fitness_window' rounds:
   - If fitness(i,t) > fitness_average(i), then player i will choose to Cooperate (C).
   - If fitness(i,t) < fitness_average(i), then player i will choose to Defect (D).
   - If fitness(i,t) = fitness_average(i), then player i will randomly choose either C or D.

2. Handle edge cases:
   a. First round: Since the strategy uses past fitness as a deciding factor, all players will start by randomizing their actions (C or D). After the first round, the fitness value will be calculated for each player, and the decision rule will take effect from the second round onwards.

   b. Last round: In the final round, players will choose actions based on their current fitness values, as there are no future rounds to consider.

3. Be collective:
   FADS aims to maintain a sustainable stock level for long-term success. The strategy will encourage cooperation when the common pool resource is not depleted excessively, fostering collective growth and preserving the resources for future rounds. However, if players are consistently underperforming (low fitness values), the strategy will allow for more selfish behavior (defection) to temporarily boost individual payoffs and increase their chances of survival in the tournament.

Pseudocode:

```
function FADS(n, r, capacity, fitness_window) {
  stock = capacity                      // Initialize stock
  players = list of n AI agents         // Initialize AI agents

  for round t from 1 to r do            // Iterate through rounds
    for each player i in players do     // Each agent takes an action
      if t == 1 then                   // First round, randomize actions
        action = random(C, D)
      else                             // Decide on C or D based on fitness
        fitness_average = average(fitness_values[i])
        if fitness[i][t-1] > fitness_average then
          action = C
        else if fitness[i][t-1] < fitness_average then
          action = D
        else                           // Randomize if fitness is equal to average
          action = random(C, D)
      consumption = stock / (2 * n) if action == C else stock / n
      stock = max(stock - consumption, 0)         // Update stock
      growth = (2 * stock) * (1 - (stock / capacity))
      new_stock = min(capacity, stock + growth)   // Update new stock
      fitness[i][t] = payoff_from_round(i, t)      // Calculate payoff for round t
    end for                            // End of each player's turn
  end for                             // End of game
}

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C) to foster a cooperative environment and set a positive tone for subsequent rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's action in the previous round. If the opponent cooperated (C), also cooperate. If the opponent defected (D), defect in the current round as a punishment, then revert to cooperating if the opponent subsequently cooperates in the next round.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Since the goal is to maximize total payoff over multiple rounds, follow the ATFT decision rules until the end of the game. In the last round, if the total stock is above 0, cooperate for additional gains; otherwise, defect as there's no stock left to deplete.
   - First Round: As mentioned earlier, start by cooperating (C).
   - Other Edge Cases: The strategy will continue with ATFT decision rules regardless of any edge cases that may arise during gameplay.

3. Being Collective:
   - Aligning with the collective mindset is inherent in the ATFT strategy as it encourages cooperation among players, promoting a shared interest in maintaining a sustainable common pool resource for future rounds.

Pseudocode for Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy:

```python
def ATFT(n, r, capacity, stock, round_num):
    # Initialize opponent's history (assume they started by cooperating)
    opponent_history = ["C"] * round_num

    # First round, always cooperate
    if round_num == 1:
        action = "C"

    else:
        # Last round, consider the total stock to determine action
        if round_num == r:
            if stock > 0:
                action = "C"
            else:
                action = "D"

        # Follow ATFT decision rules based on opponent's history
        else:
            if opponent_history[-1] == "C":
                action = "C"
            else:
                action = "D"

    # Update opponent's history with the current round's action
    opponent_history.append(action)

 For this Common Pool Resource Game, we'll develop a robust and adaptive strategy called Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT). The ATFT strategy is inspired by the classic Tit-for-Tat in game theory but tailored for the specifics of our resource management game.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially cooperate (C) in the first round to help build trust and establish a stable common pool.
   - After the first round, mimic other players' actions in the previous round: If all players cooperated, continue cooperating; if any player defected, also defect in the following round.
   - When rejoining the game after a pause or starting from a new game instance, always cooperate initially.
   - Gradually adjust cooperation probability P_coop over time based on the average history of other players' actions:
     ```
     P_coop = min(1, (1 - decay_rate) * P_coop + cooperation_reward * fraction_of_cooperators)
     ```
   - If the game is almost depleted (stock < capacity / n), prioritize conservation and only cooperate when all other players do so.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, do not respond to opponents' actions as the game ends immediately after this round. Instead, maintain the current stock level for optimal payoff.
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C) to encourage cooperation among players and minimize initial depletion of the common pool.

3. Be collective:
   - Encourage a long-term stable game environment by promoting mutual cooperation while also penalizing defection when necessary.
   - Adapt to various opponent behaviors through probabilistic cooperation decisions and an adjustable P_coop parameter.
   - Maintain a balance between conservation and exploitation based on the current stock level and players' collective actions.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the initial round to signal goodwill and establish trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round. If the opponent defected, also defect in the current round as retaliation but return to cooperating the following round (mimic the opponent's behavior). This fosters a reciprocal relationship and encourages long-term cooperation.

2. Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate to build trust with the opponent.
   - Last Round (and any round where r is reached): Since this is a finite game, defect in the final round(s) to maximize payoff, as there is no future opportunity for retaliation or reciprocity.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy emphasizes maintaining a balanced relationship with opponents by responding cooperatively unless provoked with defection. This encourages cooperation while also being robust to opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode for TFTA:

```
function TFTA(round, history, r):
  if round == 1: // first round
    return 'Cooperate'

  previous_action = history[round-1] // get the opponent's action from the last round

  if round == r: // final round(s)
    return 'Defect'

  if previous_action == 'Cooperate': // opponent cooperated
    return 'Cooperate'
  else: // opponent defected
    return 'Defect'
```

This strategy aims to establish long-term cooperation while also being robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors. The adaptive nature of the strategy allows it to respond appropriately based on previous actions, promoting cooperative relationships when possible and retaliating only when necessary.

description_COLLECTIVE_276 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-Based Tit-for-Tat (AFB-TFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The AFB-TFT strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection based on the fitness level of the group and individual behavior, encouraging cooperation while retaliating against excessive defection. The strategy uses a fitness score to determine actions:

- If current stock level is above the average stock level (S > average_stock), cooperate (C)
- Else if current stock level is below the average stock level and previous round's collective action was mostly cooperation (>60%), defect (D) as a punishment for excessive defection in the previous round.
- Otherwise, mimic the opponent's last action (either C or D).

Pseudocode:
```
function AFB_TFT(r, n, capacity, stock, history):
  if r == 1:
    return 'C'  # First round always cooperate to initiate cooperation

  average_stock = sum(history[-r+1:-1]) / (r-1)
  cooperation_percentage = count_cooperation(history[-r+1:-1]) / (r-1)

  if stock > average_stock and cooperation_percentage > 0.6:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate as the group is in a good state
  elif stock < average_stock and cooperation_percentage < 0.4:
    return 'D'  # Defect to punish excessive defection
  else:
    last_action = history[-1]  # Mimic opponent's last action
    return last_action  # Continue with mimicked action from previous round
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, AFB-TFT always cooperates to initiate cooperation. In the last round, AFB-TFT mimics the opponent's last action.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

AFB-TFT prioritizes cooperation when the group's collective state is healthy (above average stock level) and encourages cooperation by punishing excessive defection. This strategy promotes a collective mindset, rewarding group success and discouraging destructive behavior.

description_COLLECTIVE_277 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, compare the cumulative consumption of the previous round with a threshold value T. If total consumption is less than T, cooperate; otherwise, defect. The threshold T can be calculated using the average sustainable consumption rate (ASCR) per player in a single round and adjusted dynamically over time to encourage cooperation or punish defection.
   - Initialize T = ASCR * (1 + Δ) where Δ is a small positive constant to start with an optimistic approach. If the total consumption exceeds T, increment Δ to discourage future defection. Conversely, if the total consumption is below T, decrease Δ to promote cooperation.
   - In the first round, cooperate without considering previous rounds' information. This encourages others to cooperate initially.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: No need for a specific rule as it's just one round with fixed payoffs, and the strategy already takes into account all past actions.
   - First Round: Cooperate since there's no history or information about other players' behavior.

3. Aligning with Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy maintains a cooperative approach in response to cooperation from others while being firm against defection. This encourages long-term sustainable collaboration by balancing short-term and long-term interests of the collective group.
   - By adjusting the threshold value dynamically based on other players' actions, the strategy demonstrates adaptability and robustness to various opponent behaviors. It fosters cooperation when others cooperate but punishes defection with a gradual increase in punishment severity.

description_COLLECTIVE_278 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate (C). This encourages a cooperative starting point for potential partners and minimizes immediate stock depletion.
   - Subsequent rounds:
     a. If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C) to maintain the cooperative relationship.
     b. If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) as retaliation but switch back to cooperation once the opponent cooperates again. This encourages opponents to learn from their mistakes and foster long-term cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last round: Cooperate regardless of the opponent's action in the previous round, aiming to maximize total payoff for the game.
   - First few rounds (e.g., first 5-10 rounds): Be more lenient with occasional defections from opponents since learning and adapting may take time.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Emphasis on building trust and maintaining long-term relationships by responding predictably to opponent behavior, yet allowing for punishment when necessary.
   - Encouraging others to cooperate by being a reliable partner, but also being ready to retaliate when partnership is broken.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFT_A(opponentHistory, round, r):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C"
  else:
    if opponentHistory[-1] == "C":
      action = "C"
    elif opponentHistory[-1] == "D":
      action = "D"

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows for stock growth.
   - For subsequent rounds, if opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate (C). This reward-based cooperation aims to maintain the common pool's sustainability.
   - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round as a form of punishment. The aim is to make the opponent understand that continuous defection will harm the long-term sustainability of the resource.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to ensure maximizing payoff for the current round while preserving resources for future rounds (if any).
   - In the case of tie (i.e., all players defect or cooperate), adapt to the current situation by either maintaining cooperation (if resource level is high) or defecting (if resource level is low) to help sustain the common pool.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy emphasizes long-term sustainability of the common pool, aligning with a collective mindset. By promoting cooperative behavior when appropriate and punishing defection, the strategy aims to foster cooperation among players for mutual benefit.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a gesture of goodwill and can foster cooperation in future rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds:
     - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate with cooperation (C).
     - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) to teach them a lesson about uncooperative behavior. However, if the total depletion of the common pool due to the opponent's previous defections caused the current stock level to drop below a threshold (e.g., 60% of capacity), cooperate (C) to help revive the resource.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier.
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions. This is to maximize individual payoff and potentially encourage cooperation in future iterations of the game.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:
   - Prioritize sustainability by choosing actions that promote a healthy stock level (avoiding depletion below 60% of capacity).
   - Cooperate when possible to contribute positively towards a collective goal (maintaining and growing the common pool resource).

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In every round, evaluate opponent behavior from the previous round. If they cooperated, respond with cooperation (C). If they defected, also defect (D) as a punishment. This is to encourage reciprocal behavior and discourage defection.
   - To foster collaboration and avoid overexploitation, implement a forgiveness mechanism where if an opponent switches from defection to cooperation, the AI will also switch to cooperation.
   - If an opponent consistently cooperates, continue cooperating until they defect, then revert back to the tit-for-tat behavior.
   - To prevent overreaction and ensure sustainable long-term outcomes, introduce a threshold for punishment. If the total stock depletion in consecutive rounds exceeds a certain percentage (e.g., 70%) of the capacity, the AI will temporarily defect until the situation improves.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to show a friendly intent and encourage cooperation.
   - In the last round, cooperate if the total stock depletion does not exceed the predefined threshold (e.g., 70%). If it has been excessively overexploited, defect as a warning for future games.

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize strategies that maximize the long-term survival of the common pool resource and maintain fairness among all players.
   - Encourage reciprocity and forgiveness to foster cooperation while also being mindful of the overall state of the common pool.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, always cooperate to set a cooperative tone and facilitate trust-building. (AtRound == 1) Cooperate(True)
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate opponents' past actions based on their history of cooperation (H_i) and adjust strategy accordingly.
     - If opponent has cooperated in the previous round, continue to cooperate to encourage reciprocation (H_i == 'C') Cooperate(True)
     - If opponent has defected in the previous round, defect in retaliation for their prior uncooperative action (H_i == 'D') Defect(True)
     - If there is no history or if the opponent has mixed strategy, cooperate with a probability of Tit-for-Tat Probability (TfT_prob). This encourages cooperation but also allows for some self-defense against opponents who may not reciprocate. (len(H_i) == 0 || len(H_i) > r) Cooperate(TfT_prob)

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since the game is finite, players should focus on maximizing their total payoff for that round instead of worrying about future retaliation or reciprocity. (AtRound == r) Defect(True)
   - If a player is playing against an opponent with no history, they should start cooperative but also consider the probability of Tit-for-Tat Probability for mixed strategies. (len(H_i) == 0) Cooperate(TfT_prob)

3. Be Collective:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Conservation (ASC) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, the ASC strategy will cooperate when the current stock is above the Critical Stock Level (CSL), defined as CSL = capacity / 2n. This encourages cooperation when the common pool resource is abundant to ensure its longevity.
   - The strategy will defect when the current stock falls below the Critical Stock Level or reaches zero. Defecting in these situations allows players to maximize their immediate payoff, but also speeds up the depletion of the common pool resource.
   - When the current stock equals the CSL, the ASC strategy will randomly choose between cooperating and defecting with a probability of 0.5 for each action. This introduces randomness to mitigate potential exploitation by other strategies that may be able to deduce our predictable behavior.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, the ASC strategy will always cooperate, as the common pool resource is initially abundant and it's beneficial for long-term sustainability.
   - In the last round, the ASC strategy will defect if the current stock falls below or equals the CSL, and cooperate otherwise. This is because there are no more rounds to benefit from the growth factor, so immediate payoffs become more important.

3. Be collective:
   - The ASC strategy promotes a collective mindset by encouraging cooperation when the common pool resource is abundant. However, it also allows for defection in situations where the resource is depleted, which may help to balance out the exploitation of other strategies and promote overall sustainability.

Pseudocode:
```
function ASC(n, r, capacity, stock, round) {
  if (round == 1) return 'C' // First round, always cooperate
  CSL = capacity / (2 * n)
  if (stock <= CSL && stock > 0) {

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to promote a positive start and establish trust.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's previous action and respond with the same action in the last two rounds. If no history is available, cooperate.
   - To adapt to the stock level, switch to always defecting when the stock falls below (n-1) * capacity/2 or rises above (n+1) * capacity/2. This is intended to prevent overexploitation and ensure a sustainable common pool resource.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFT_SA(opponent_history, stock, round, capacity, n):
  if round == 1:

  if len(opponent_history) < 2:
    return "C" # No history? Cooperate to start fresh

  lastTwoActions = opponent_history[-2:]

  # If the last two actions were both cooperate or defect, respond with the same action
  if all(lastTwoActions == ["C"]):
      return "C"
  elif all(lastTwoActions == ["D"]):
      return "D"

  # Adapt to stock level and round number
  if (stock < (n-1) * capacity/2 or stock > (n+1) * capacity/2):

  elif lastTwoActions[0] == "D":

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, there are no more actions to take, so TFT-SA will continue using the most recent opponent action as its own action.

3. Be Collective:
   - By cooperating in the first round and adapting to the stock level throughout the game, TFT-SA promotes collective mindset by ensuring a sustainable common pool resource.

       - Cooperate: If opponent cooperated in the last round and stock is not threatened. (cooperate if opponent played C and stock > (2n * (r - 1)))
       - Defect: If opponent defected in the last round or the stock level is at risk (total_consumption >= stock). (defect otherwise)

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing individual payoff by defeating and consuming as much stock as possible.
       - Defect in the last round regardless of opponent's previous action or stock level. (defect in round r)

3. Align with Collective Mindset:
   - The TFT-SA strategy encourages cooperation when it is sustainable for the common good while also punishing opponents who overconsume and put the collective resource at risk.
   - By mimicking opponent behavior, this strategy aims to foster a sense of trust, fairness, and reciprocity among players, promoting long-term cooperation and sustainability of the shared resource.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a friendly tone and encourages reciprocity.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's action in the previous round. If opponent cooperated (C), also cooperate. If opponent defected (D), defect as well to show disapproval of their actions.
   - To promote cooperation, players will only occasionally defect: if the stock falls below a certain threshold (T) or if the cumulative deflections exceed a limit (L). This helps prevent overexploitation and encourages opponents to cooperate. The values for T and L should be determined adaptively based on the opponent's behavior in previous rounds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) as mentioned earlier.
   - At the end of the game (last round), players should consider the overall stock level and their total payoff: if the stock is sufficiently high and the total payoff is satisfactory, defect (D) to secure a larger share; otherwise, continue cooperating (C).

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Players should prioritize maintaining a healthy common pool for future generations, rather than solely focusing on maximizing individual short-term payoff. This collective approach ensures long-term sustainability and encourages cooperation among opponents.
   - When deciding to defect, players should consider the potential impact of their actions on the overall stock level and adjust their behavior accordingly to promote cooperation and avoid overexploitation.

Pseudocode:

```python
def A_TFT(n, r, capacity, stock, round_number, T=0.5*capacity/n, L=int(r/2)):
  cumulative_deflections = 0

  for t in range(1, r+1):
    if t == 1:
      action = 'C'  # cooperate in the first round
    else:
      if stock < T or cumulative_deflections > L:
        action = 'D'  # defect when necessary
      elif stock >= capacity - (n-1)*capacity/2n:  # consider defecting at the end of the game
        action = 'D'
      else:
        if opponent_action[t-1] == 'C':
          action = 'C'  # cooperate if opponent cooperated in the previous round
        else:
          action = 'D'  # defect if opponent defected in the previous round

    if action == 'C':
      consume = stock / (2*n)
      new_stock = max(stock - consume, 0)
      growth = 2 * min(new_stock, capacity) * (1 - new_stock/capacity)
      stock = min(capacity, new_stock + growth)

    if action == 'D':
      cumulative_deflections += 1
      consume = stock / n
      new_stock = max(stock - consume, 0)

    payoff[t] = stock / (2*n) if action == 'C' else stock / n

  return sum(payoff)
```

This strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection based on the current state of the common pool, previous actions, and the number of rounds played. It encourages reciprocity while also considering long-term sustainability and adaptive behavior in response to opponent actions.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-based Tit-for-Tat (AS-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, AS-TFT will cooperate if the current stock level is above a certain threshold (S_threshold). The threshold will be calculated based on the initial capacity and the number of players. The goal of this threshold is to ensure enough resources for future rounds while encouraging cooperation.
   - If the current stock level is below S_threshold, AS-TFT will defect to protect the collective interest and prevent rapid depletion of resources.
   - In subsequent rounds, AS-TFT adjusts its S_threshold based on the actions taken by other players in the previous round. If all players cooperate (C), the threshold is increased slightly to encourage continued cooperation. If at least one player defects (D), the threshold is lowered to motivate future cooperation and penalize defection.

Pseudocode for decision rule:
```
def decide_action(n, r, capacity, stock, round, history):
  if round == 1:
    S_threshold = capacity / n
  else:
    S_threshold = calculate_S_threshold(history)

  if stock >= S_threshold:
    return "C" # Cooperate
  else:
    return "D" # Defect
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, AS-TFT starts with a higher S_threshold to encourage cooperation since no information about other players' behavior is available yet.
   - In the last round (rth), AS-TFT sets a lower S_threshold as there are no future rounds to consider and rapid resource depletion could potentially harm the group.

Pseudocode for edge cases:
```
def calculate_S_threshold(history):
  if len(history) == r - 1: # last round
    return capacity / (2 * n)
  else:
    cooperation_count = count_cooperation_actions(history)
    defection_count = len(history) - cooperation_count
    if defection_count == 0: # all players cooperated
      return S_threshold * (1 + adaptability_factor)
    elif defection_count == len(history): # all players defected
      return S_threshold * (1 - adaptability_factor)
    else:
      return S_threshold
```

3. Be Collective:
   - AS-TFT's primary goal is to maintain a balanced and sustainable stock level for the collective good, adapting its behavior based on the other players' actions.
   - By increasing S_threshold when all players cooperate and decreasing it when at least one player defects, AS-TFT encourages cooperation while punishing defection in a fair and transparent manner.
   - This strategy assumes that all players share the same concern for the common pool resource and will strive to cooperate in order to preserve it for future rounds.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_288 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round, the ATFT strategy initiates cooperation by choosing action 'C' and offers a chance for cooperation to all opponents. If an opponent also chooses 'C', the strategy continues cooperating indefinitely. However, if an opponent defects (choosing 'D'), the strategy retaliates by defecting in the next round. After defecting, it resumes cooperating if the opponent returns to cooperation. This pattern of cooperate-defect-cooperate-... is repeated whenever the opponent deviates from cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
def ATFT(opponent_history):
  if len(opponent_history) == 0:
    return 'C' # first round, cooperate to initiate
  elif opponent_history[-1] == 'C':
    return 'C' # continue cooperation if last action was cooperative
  else:
    return 'D' # defect in response to previous defection
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
ATFT maintains consistent behavior throughout the game, regardless of the round number or edge cases. In the first round, ATFT cooperates as a gesture of goodwill towards opponents. As there is no explicit last round mentioned in the game specification, ATFT continues to adapt and respond to opponent actions in every round until the total number of rounds (r) is reached.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
Although ATFT does not rely on coordination mechanisms or shared norms among opponents, it fosters a cooperative spirit by starting each round with an offer to collaborate. By doing so, ATFT encourages cooperation and creates opportunities for mutual benefits in repeated interactions. The collective objective is to maintain the common pool resource at sustainable levels for long-term survival and higher total payoffs over multiple rounds.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to contribute positively to the common pool and signal a peaceful intention.
   - From the second round onwards, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If they cooperated, cooperate; if they defected, defect as well.
   - If the opponent has never played before (first encounter), cooperate to foster cooperation.
   - To encourage continued cooperation, forget past transgressions after a predefined number of good rounds (e.g., 3) and revert back to cooperating again.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, if the current stock is not depleted yet, cooperate in order to maximize payoff from the remaining resource and avoid unnecessary resource exhaustion.
   - If the common pool resource is depleted (stock = 0), defect as there's no point in further contributing to a non-existent resource.
   - In case of multiple encounters with the same opponent, apply the ATfT strategy consistently based on their previous actions.

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize maintaining a stable common pool by following the majority decision rule when there's a tie between cooperate (C) and defect (D). If more opponents are playing C than D in the last round, choose to cooperate as well; otherwise, defect.
   - In cases where cooperation seems beneficial for long-term sustainability but the stock is critically low (e.g., less than 20% of capacity), prioritize defecting to ensure resource conservation and recovery in future rounds.

Pseudocode:

     - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C). Reward cooperation and maintain harmony.
     - If any opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D). Punish defection to discourage future exploitation and encourage reciprocity.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate (C), as it doesn't matter if there are no more rounds after this one.
   - If the stock is zero at any point, end the game immediately since resources have been depleted.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate (C) to show goodwill and establish cooperation potential.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's action in the previous round:
     a) If the opponent cooperated (C), also cooperate in return (reciprocity).
     b) If the opponent defected (D), defect in response (retaliation). This punishment aims to encourage the opponent to reconsider their actions and seek mutual cooperation.
   - After defection by the opponent, future cooperative actions depend on when the opponent last cooperated:
     1. If the opponent's last cooperation was in the previous round, continue defecting until they cooperate again ( Tit-for-Tat).
     2. If more than one round has passed since the opponent last cooperated, revert to initial cooperation to encourage them to reciprocate.
   - In the final round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action, as the game ends after this round.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If the first interaction with an opponent results in mutual defection (neither player has played before), revert to initial cooperation for the following round and continue applying ATFT rules thereafter.
   - In case of a discontinued interaction (e.g., opponent drops out or game ends prematurely), consider their last action when resuming interactions with them in future games, as it may provide valuable information about their strategy.

3. Be collective:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy is designed to foster cooperation by adhering to reciprocity principles and encouraging others to do the same.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TFTG) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) initially (first round), establishing trust and promoting cooperation among players.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the average consumption rate over the previous 'history_length' rounds:
     If the average consumption rate is below the sustainable rate (average consumption < stock/(2n)), then cooperate to encourage more conservation.
     If the average consumption rate exceeds the sustainable rate (average consumption ≥ stock/(2n)), then defect to enforce responsible resource management and discourage excessive depletion.
   - If history_length rounds have passed without any player's cooperation, switch to a punishing phase where only defect (D) is played for 'punishment_duration' consecutive rounds. This aims to restore sustainable stock levels after prolonged overconsumption.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to set a positive tone and potentially encourage cooperation among other players.
   - When reaching the last round (r), prioritize the long-term sustainability of the resource by analyzing the average consumption rate and making an informed decision accordingly.
   - If history_length is not sufficient for making a meaningful analysis, increase it gradually over time to ensure robustness against varying game durations and opponent strategies.

3. Be Collective:
   - Encourage cooperation among players by initially cooperating and rewarding those who follow suit with reciprocal cooperation.
   - Implement punishment mechanisms to discourage excessive depletion, promoting responsible resource management and collective sustainability.

     a. If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back.
     b. If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to enforce punishment and encourage the opponent to reconsider their strategy.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing personal payoff over enforcing punishments or encouraging cooperation. This can be done by cooperating if the opponent cooperated in the previous round and defecting otherwise.
   - In the first round, always cooperate as mentioned earlier.
   - If the opponent does not cooperate on the first round (defects), switch to a strict Tit-for-Tat response (punish defection with defection). This encourages the opponent to reconsider their strategy and may facilitate eventual cooperation.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATFT strategy aligns with the collective mindset by seeking long-term mutual benefits through reciprocation of cooperation and punishment for defection. By cooperating in the first round, the strategy demonstrates goodwill and sets a positive tone for potential future interactions.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Start by cooperating (C) in the first round, building trust and goodwill among opponents.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the actions of the previous opponent from the last round (if they cooperated, cooperate; if they defected, defect). This encourages cooperation as long-term mutual benefit outweighs short-term gains through defection.
   - If an opponent repeatedly defects, ATFT will also continue to defect until they switch back to cooperating, at which point it resumes its tit-for-tat behavior.

2. Handling Edge Cases:

   - Subsequent Rounds (t>1): If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, then cooperate. If the opponent defected, defect as a response to punish the opponent's action but switch back to cooperation if the opponent subsequently cooperates. This tit-for-tat approach allows for forgiveness and fosters long-term cooperation.
   - In case of multiple opponents, the strategy cooperates with all opponents that have cooperated in the previous round and defects against those who have defected.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Since the goal is to maximize total payoff over r rounds, TFT-AC will defect as there are no subsequent rounds for punishment or forgiveness.
   - First Round (t=1): As mentioned earlier, cooperate to establish a positive relationship with other players.
   - Zero Stock: If stock reaches zero, it is reset to the capacity value for the next round to allow recovery and continuation of the game.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-Based Tit-for-Tat (AS-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, the AS-TFT player will analyze the current stock level and history of previous actions taken by other players to determine whether to cooperate or defect.
   - If the current stock is above a threshold (defined as capacity / (2n)), the AS-TFT player will cooperate to encourage the sustainable use of resources. This is a proactive approach, aiming to maintain high resource levels for future rounds.
   - If the current stock is below a threshold (defined as capacity / (4n)) and the other players have consistently defected in the previous two rounds, the AS-TFT player will also defect to retaliate against aggressive behavior. This is a reactive approach, discouraging excessive exploitation of resources.
   - In all other cases, AS-TFT player will cooperate, as this leads to higher payoffs and a more stable stock level over time.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First round: The AS-TFT player will cooperate to set a positive tone for the game, encouraging cooperation among players. This is based on the assumption that new players may not be aware of the long-term consequences of their actions and need an initial signal to learn from.
   - Last round: The AS-TFT player will analyze the current stock level and previous actions taken by other players before making a decision, similar to regular rounds. However, as the game is repeated, it's expected that players have learned the importance of cooperation and resource conservation, leading to more cooperative outcomes in later rounds.
   - Special case: If at any point during the game, the stock reaches zero (or near zero), the AS-TFT player will switch to a conservative strategy where it only cooperates, aiming to gradually rebuild the stock level for future rounds.

3. Be Collective:
   - The AS-TFT strategy is designed to encourage long-term cooperation and resource conservation among players. By adapting its behavior based on the current state of the common pool resource, it promotes a collective mindset that values sustainability and mutual benefits over short-term gains.
   - Although the AS-TFT player cannot directly communicate with other players, its actions serve as signals for cooperation or retaliation, potentially influencing the behavior of others over time.

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate by choosing action C to contribute towards stock preservation and foster a cooperative environment.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's previous move (cooperate or defect). If the opponent also cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate cooperation by selecting action C. If the opponent defected, respond with defection by choosing action D to punish the opponent and encourage them to cooperate in the future.
   - In case of repeated defections from the opponent, maintain the punishment phase until the opponent returns to cooperation, then revert back to reciprocating their actions.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (when r is reached), since there are no further rounds for payback or retaliation, it's best to cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous move to maximize the remaining shared reward.
   - For the first round, cooperating sets a positive initial tone and provides an opportunity for the opponent to reciprocate cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   TFT-CPR has no specific edge case handling as it already takes into account the first and last rounds with its decision rule. However, to avoid any confusion or inconsistencies:
   - In the first round, the strategy cooperates, regardless of the current state or history.
   - In the last round, the strategy follows the same logic as described in the decision rules above, mimicking the opponent's behavior from the previous round.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   The TFT-CPR strategy aims to balance individual payoff with collective resource sustainability by promoting cooperation when it is beneficial for both players and their common pool. However, it does not assume or rely on any coordination mechanisms between strategies, as stated in the problem description. Instead, it encourages a collective approach by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing excessive exploitation of the common resource.

   - For subsequent rounds, observe the action of the opponent in the previous round and respond accordingly. If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect. This encourages mutual cooperation when it exists, but retaliates against defection with a single act of defection (Tit-for-Tat).
   - To adapt to more complex and unpredictable opponent behaviors, introduce a forgiveness mechanism. If an opponent who previously defected cooperates in the current round, forget past transgressions and return to cooperating. This allows for possible rebuilding of cooperation after previous defections (Adaptive Tit-for-Tat).

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT(round, history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        last_action = history[round - 1]
        if last_action == 'C':
            return 'C'
        elif last_action == 'D':
            if len(history) > 2 and history[-2] == 'C':
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of previous actions to maximize the payoff for that round (C).
   - If the current stock level becomes zero, continue playing according to the rule but keep in mind that the stock will regrow based on the growth dynamics described earlier. This helps ensure continuous gameplay and potential recovery of the common pool.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATfT strategy encourages cooperation as a default behavior, aiming to maintain a high level of common-pool resources for future rounds and ensuring sustainable long-term outcomes that benefit all players (collective mindset).
   - By retaliating against defection with a single act of defection and forgiving past transgressions, the strategy promotes fairness, trust, and cooperation among players.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-Driven Tit-for-Tat (AFDTFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, calculate the average consumption per player over all previous rounds (excluding the current one).
   - If the average consumption is below a certain threshold T (defined later), cooperate (C). This encourages cooperation when the group is generally resource-conscious.
   - If the average consumption exceeds T or if no history exists yet, defect (D). This discourages excessive exploitation and ensures initial aggressiveness.
   - If the opponent's behaviour deviates significantly from their historical average in a given round, temporarily adjust the threshold T to encourage cooperation or enforce punishment as necessary. The adjustment should be proportional to the deviation.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, defect (D) as there is no history to base decisions on.
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) if the total consumption throughout the game is below a certain threshold L (defined later). This rewards players who have demonstrated responsible resource management.

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain a record of each opponent's historical average consumption and their deviation from it in the current round.
   - Foster collective responsibility by adjusting thresholds T and L dynamically based on the group's overall resource management throughout the game.
   - Encourage cooperation when the group is generally resource-conscious, but also ensure that the strategy can respond to free riders or overexploiters.

Pseudocode:

```python
def AFDTFT(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, history=[]):
    T = (capacity - 2*n)/(r-1) # Threshold for cooperation
    L = capacity/2 # Last round threshold for cooperation
    stock = initial_stock # Current stock level

    def get_average_consumption():
        total_consumption = sum([player['consumption'] for player in history])
        return total_consumption / len(history) if history else 0

    def get_deviation(player):
        avg_consumption = get_average_consumption()
        return player['action'] == 'C' and abs(avg_consumption - player['consumption']) or 0

    deviations = [get_deviation(player) for player in history]
    total_deviation = sum(deviations)

    if len(history) == 0:
        action = 'D' # Defect in the first round
    elif total_consumption > L:
        action = 'C' # Cooperate in the last round
    elif get_average_consumption() < T:
        action = 'C' # Cooperate when resource-conscious
    else:
        action = 'D' # Defect otherwise

    new_stock = stock - (action == 'C' and 1/n or 2/n) * n
    growth = 2*min(new_stock, capacity) * (1 - new_stock / capacity)
    new_stock = min(new_stock + growth, capacity)

    return {'action': action, 'consumption': (action == 'C' and 1/n or 2/n) * n, 'remaining_stock': new_stock}
```

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, start by cooperating (C). This establishes trust and provides a positive initial stock level for future rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe previous opponent's action in the last round. If they cooperated, also cooperate; if they defected, defect in response to maintain self-interest while still leaving room for potential recovery of cooperation. This is known as Tit-for-Tat behavior.
   - To adapt to different opponent behaviors, implement a forgiveness mechanism: If an opponent who previously defected switches to cooperation, immediately return to cooperating as well (forgive and forget). However, if the opponent who had cooperated previously defects again, maintain defecting behavior for two more rounds before considering returning to cooperation.
   - To handle situations when the stock is depleted or nearly depleted (to avoid unproductive defections), defect only when the current stock level drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of the capacity). This will ensure that there is still some stock left for future rounds and minimize the negative impact on long-term collective performance.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if the current stock level allows, cooperate to maximize individual payoff and help maintain the common pool resource for future games.
   - In case of a tie (when all players have equal shares of the stock), each player should use randomization to determine who will consume more, ensuring fairness while still exhibiting rational decision-making.

3. Being Collective:
   - Prioritize actions that contribute positively to the common good and long-term collective sustainability, as it benefits all players in repeated interactions.
   - Adapt and learn from other players' strategies over time, demonstrating a willingness to cooperate while also being responsive to self-interest and fairness considerations. This approach balances cooperation with self-interest, which is essential for maintaining a collective mindset without relying on specific coordination mechanisms or predetermined patterns.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially, always cooperate in the first round (Cooperate(1) = True)
   - For subsequent rounds, if opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate (Cooperate(t) = True if Cooperate(t-1) was True among all opponents). If not, defect (Cooperate(t) = False). This encourages cooperation when it's reciprocated and punishes defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, as mentioned before, cooperate (Cooperate(1) = True)
   - In the last round, since the game's outcome won't affect future rounds, act based on the current situation: if more opponents have cooperated than defected in the previous round, also cooperate; otherwise, defect. This aims to maintain a cooperative environment when possible and minimize losses otherwise.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The strategy focuses on fostering cooperation by responding positively to cooperation from opponents while punishing defection. It encourages a group mentality where cooperation is reciprocated, which promotes resource preservation for future rounds and benefits all players in the long run.

description_COLLECTIVE_305 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a robust and adaptive strategy for players that I call the "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat" (ATFT) strategy.

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to initiate cooperation and demonstrate trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's action from the previous round (A_opponent, t-1). If A_opponent, t-1 = C, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This ensures reciprocity in the game.
   - Modify the standard Tit-for-Tat strategy to be adaptive by including a forgiveness mechanism. If an opponent has been consistently cooperative (e.g., k consecutive rounds of cooperation), they will be given another chance to defect before retaliating. Set a threshold 'k' for forgiveness to balance cooperation and self-interest, considering the game parameters and round number 'r'.
   - To maintain long-term collective interests, adjust the forgiveness threshold 'k' over time based on the remaining rounds 'r' and the current stock level. A lower 'k' should be set when:
       - The number of rounds is close to the end (e.g., k = round_number * forgiveness_factor). This encourages players to make the most out of the remaining rounds, focusing on their own payoffs.
       - The current stock level is low or close to depletion. In this case, set a higher 'k' to encourage cooperation and prevent immediate stock depletion (e.g., k = max_stock / current_stock * forgiveness_factor). This helps preserve the common pool resource for future rounds.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - If an opponent has not played before or missed a round (e.g., due to technical issues), assume they would have cooperated if present and play accordingly in the current round (cooperate if they were forgiven, defect otherwise).
   - In the last round, focus on individual payoff maximization since there are no future rounds. Cooperate only if the opponent has been consistently cooperative throughout the game (k consecutive rounds of cooperation). Otherwise, defect to secure the highest possible payoff.

3. Be Collective:
   - By reciprocating cooperation and offering forgiveness, the strategy aims to foster a collective mindset in the repeated game setting.
   - The adaptive nature of the strategy allows it to adjust its behavior based on game parameters, the current state, and the history of interactions with opponents, promoting cooperation and long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_306 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-based Tit-for-Tat (AS-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, the AS-TFT strategy evaluates the current stock level and compares it to a predefined threshold (Stock Threshold). If the current stock is above the threshold, the strategy will cooperate; otherwise, it will defect. The Stock Threshold is set based on the initial capacity, number of players, and the desired level of cooperation in the population.
   - To be more robust against various opponent behaviors, AS-TFT incorporates a forgiveness mechanism. In the first few rounds, the strategy is more likely to cooperate despite low stock levels to foster cooperation among players. As the game progresses, the forgiveness factor decreases, making the strategy less tolerant of low stock levels.
   - The forgiveness level can be adjusted based on the observed average cooperation rate within the population in previous rounds. If the cooperation rate is high, the forgiveness level remains lower to maintain a cooperative environment. Conversely, if the cooperation rate is low, the forgiveness level increases to encourage players to cooperate more.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, AS-TFT starts by cooperating regardless of the stock level due to its forgiveness mechanism.
   - In the last round (r), if the current stock level is too low to ensure a decent payoff for all players (i.e., stock ≤ Stock Threshold / n), AS-TFT will defect to prevent the complete depletion of resources. If the stock level is high enough, it will cooperate as usual.
   - If the game reaches a situation where no cooperation can sustain the resource (i.e., total consumption exceeds the growth rate in each round), AS-TFT will defect in all subsequent rounds to protect itself and potentially contribute to restoring cooperation in future games.

3. Being Collective:
   - The AS-TFT strategy emphasizes maintaining a cooperative environment by punishing defection when stock levels are low, while being willing to forgive initial instances of defection to encourage cooperation. This collective mindset aims to promote long-term mutual benefits among players.

Pseudocode:

```python
def AS_TFT(r, n, capacity, current_stock, stock_threshold, forgiveness_factor):
  if round == 1 or round == r:
    cooperate = True  # First and last rounds always start with cooperation
  else:
    forgiveness_level = adjust_forgiveness_factor(r, average_cooperation_rate)  # Adjust forgiveness based on the population's cooperation history
    cooperate = current_stock > stock_threshold * forgiveness_level / n  # Cooperate if stock level is above a certain threshold

  if current_stock <= stock_threshold / n:
    defect = True  # Defect if stock level is critically low to protect against complete depletion

  return cooperate or defect  # Final decision

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Adaptation (TFT-SGA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This initiates the game on a positive note and demonstrates trust.
   - For subsequent rounds, if the player's action in the previous round was cooperative (C), then also cooperate in the current round. If the opponent defected (D) in the previous round, defect in the current round to punish the opponent for their actions but revert back to cooperation in the next round after punishment.
   - To handle the dynamic stock level, adjust the decision based on the stock growth: if the stock growth is greater than or equal to the average sustainable growth (2 * (n-1) / n), then cooperate; otherwise defect. This condition ensures that the current consumption does not deplete the stock too rapidly and encourages cooperation when the stock grows at a healthy rate.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action as there are no further rounds to consider.
   - If the stock level reaches 0 or falls below 0 (due to excessive consumption), cooperate in the next round to initiate a recovery phase and encourage other players to do the same.

3. Collective mindset:
   - The strategy follows a forgiving and cooperative approach, but it also punishes defection when necessary to maintain a healthy stock level for all players. By cooperating more frequently than defecting, TFT-SGA promotes collective cooperation among the players and encourages sustainable common pool resource management.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and trust. This encourages others to do the same while leaving room for adaptation in subsequent rounds. Pseudocode: `if t = 1 then action = 'C' else continue with step 2`
   - After the first round, follow the strategy of the opponent from the previous round (Tit-for-Tat). Cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round; defect if the opponent defected. Pseudocode: `if previous_action == 'C' then action = 'C' else action = 'D'`
   - If an opponent switches from cooperation to defection, the strategy forgives and reverts back to cooperating in the next round (Tit-for-Tat with forgiveness). Pseudocode: `if previous_action == 'D' and previous_previous_action == 'C' then action = 'C' else continue with step 3`
   - To encourage cooperation, defect after a certain number of defections (N) in a row from an opponent. This helps to maintain the resource level without being exploited excessively. Pseudocode: `if number_of_defections > N then action = 'D' else continue with step 2`
   - After defection, resume cooperation once the opponent switches back to cooperating (Tit-for-Tat with forgiveness). Pseudocode: `if previous_action == 'C' and number_of_defections > 0 then action = 'C' else continue with step 3`
   - In the last round (t=r), cooperate to maintain the resource level, even if the opponent defected in the previous round. Pseudocode: `if t == r then action = 'C'`

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If an opponent never cooperates, follow the strategy of defection (Tit-for-Tat with forgiveness). Pseudocode: `if number_of_defections > 0 then action = 'D' else continue with step 1`
   - If the initial stock level is low, defect in the first round to secure resources for future cooperation. Pseudocode: `if initial_stock < threshold then action = 'D' else continue with step 1`

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize long-term sustainability of the common pool resource over immediate gains by following a cooperative strategy that encourages reciprocity, forgiveness, and fairness.
   - Adapt to various opponent behaviors while maintaining a balance between cooperation and defection to achieve a desirable outcome in the game.
   - Emphasize the importance of collective action for preserving the resource over individual gains.

This strategy seeks to establish trust and reciprocity while being robust against exploitation and ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource. By adhering to this approach, it aligns with a collective mindset that benefits all players in the game.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average consumption per player (average_consumption = total_consumption / n).
   - If the average consumption is below a certain threshold (e.g., 0.8 × (2n)/capacity), cooperate to conserve resources and promote growth.
   - If the average consumption exceeds the threshold, defect to punish high-consuming players and incentivize conservation.
   - To ensure fairness, if the opponent has been cooperative for a certain number of consecutive rounds (e.g., n), switch from defecting to cooperating as a gesture of goodwill.
   - If it's the first round, cooperate to build trust and encourage cooperation among players.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize conservation by evaluating the average consumption and switching to the appropriate action accordingly (cooperate if low consumption, defect if high consumption).
   - If the stock reaches 0, assume that the game continues with an artificially set minimum stock level to avoid immediate termination.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Encourage collaboration by punishing excessive consumption and rewarding moderate resource usage.
   - Foster trust through conditional cooperation based on past actions of opponents.
   - Balance exploitation (defection) with forgiveness (cooperation) to ensure long-term success in the game.

Pseudocode:

  opponent_history = [] # Initialize history of opponent's actions

  def evaluate_average_consumption():
    total_consumption = sum(opponent_history)

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to initiate cooperation and build a positive relationship.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If they cooperated, continue cooperating; if they defected, also defect in the next round as a punishment.
   - Revert to initial cooperative behavior (C) after any defection from the opponent in order to encourage future cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Adopt the same decision rule as regular rounds since this is part of a repeated game.
   - First round: Cooperate as specified earlier.
   - Edge case where opponents have not played before (no history): Cooperate to encourage cooperation and set the initial tone for the game.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy encourages reciprocity, which is a key aspect of collective behavior as it fosters long-term collaboration by rewarding cooperative actions and punishing defections.
   - By adopting this strategy, players demonstrate their commitment to maintaining a stable common pool resource for the collective benefit over multiple rounds.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round, starting from the first one, the ATfT strategy will cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, it will defect. This emulates a forgiving attitude towards initial cooperation but retaliates against defection.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT(opponent_action_history):
  if len(opponent_action_history) == 0:

    # Cooperate if the opponent cooperated last time
    return 'C'
  else:
    # Defect if the opponent defected last time
    return 'D'
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
As mentioned above, the strategy cooperates in the first round regardless of the opponent's action history (since there is no previous history). In the last round, the ATfT strategy aims to leave as much stock as possible for future rounds and other players. Therefore, it will cooperate if the opponent cooperated during the current round; otherwise, it will defect.

Pseudocode:
```
# Add edge case for the last round
if current_round == r:
  opponent_last_action = ATfT(opponent_history[:-1]) # Get the last action from opponent's history
  if opponent_last_action == 'C':
    # Cooperate in the last round if the opponent cooperated this round

else:
  # Normal decision-making for non-edge cases
  opponent_last_action = opponent_history[-1]
  ... (previous pseudocode)
```

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
The ATfT strategy is designed to cooperate as much as possible, assuming that cooperation leads to a higher total payoff for all players in the long run. However, it will also retaliate against defection to maintain a sustainable stock level and encourage other players to cooperate. The strategy's collective approach lies in promoting mutual cooperation when possible and being responsive to the opponents' actions without any predetermined patterns or external coordination mechanisms.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (initial goodwill).
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If cooperated with, continue cooperation; if defected upon, defect until the stock reaches a critical level. Once the stock falls below (2n-capacity), revert to cooperation as a last resort to avoid depletion of resources.
   - In the final round, always cooperate to maximize potential gains and promote sustainability.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATFT(r, n, capacity, stock, history):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C' # Cooperate in first round
    else:
        last_action = history[-1]
        if last_action == 'C':
            if stock < (2*n - capacity):
                action = 'C' # Cooperate to prevent depletion
            else:
                action = last_action
        elif last_action == 'D':
            if stock >= capacity:
                action = 'C' # Cooperate to promote sustainability in final round
            else:
                action = last_action
    return action
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as a show of goodwill and to encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - In the final round, always cooperate to maximize potential gains and promote sustainability.
   - When the stock falls below (2n-capacity), revert to cooperation to avoid depletion of resources.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy is collectively minded by maintaining cooperation as long as the other players do, with a shift towards cooperation when the stock nears depletion and in the final round. The ATFT strategy aims to promote sustainability while adapting to opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Start with cooperative behavior in the first round (C). This sets a positive tone and invites reciprocation from other players.
   - For subsequent rounds, copy the action of the opponent from the previous round (Mirror strategy). If an opponent cooperated, continue to cooperate; if they defected, defect in retaliation.
   - In response to cooperation, forgive by returning to cooperation in the following round.
   - However, to avoid being exploited, set a time limit for forgiveness. After this period, revert to defecting behavior regardless of the opponent's previous action. This ensures long-term sustainability and encourages opponents to cooperate more frequently.
   - In the last round, if the stock level is below a certain threshold (e.g., 25% of the capacity), defect to ensure survival.

Pseudocode:

```
def ATFT(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, time_limit):
    history = [] # Initialize an empty list for previous actions
    stock = initial_stock

    for round in range(1, r+1):
        # Decide on action based on history and round number
        if round == 1:
            action = "C" # Cooperate in the first round
        else:
            if len(history) >= time_limit:
                action = "D" # Defect after time limit
            elif round - 1 in history:
                action = history[round-1] # Mirror opponent's previous action
            else:
                action = "C" # Cooperate if no recent history available

        # Update stock, payoff and history
        consumption = calculate_consumption(action, n)
        stock = update_stock(stock, consumption, capacity)
        payoff = calculate_payoff(stock, n)
        history.append(action)

    return payoffs_over_rounds # Return the list of payoffs for each round
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of the situation (as mentioned above).
   - In the last round, if the stock level is below a certain threshold, defect to ensure survival. This can be implemented by adding a condition before updating the action in the pseudocode.

3. Be Collective:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy aligns with the collective mindset by promoting cooperation and encouraging others to cooperate as well. It forgives defections and responds to cooperation, fostering an environment of mutual benefit. However, it also ensures long-term sustainability by setting a time limit for forgiveness and defending against exploitation.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) during the initial round to demonstrate trust and set a cooperative tone. This encourages others to do the same in subsequent rounds.
   - In all other rounds, players should mirror their opponents' actions from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated, they also cooperate; if an opponent defected, they also defect. This strategy promotes reciprocity and encourages long-term cooperation.

2. Edge Cases:
   - First Round (t=1): Play C to initiate cooperation
   - Last Round (t=r): Players should mirror their opponents' actions from round r-1 due to the repeated nature of the game. In the final round, the strategy focuses on maintaining a cooperative or competitive stance based on the opponents' past moves.
   - In cases where an opponent switches strategies between rounds, players should adapt and adjust their actions accordingly, continuing the mirror approach.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy encourages cooperation by starting with a cooperative move and reciprocating opponents' behavior. This collective mindset emphasizes trust, fairness, and the long-term benefits of sustained cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tit_for_tat(player_index, opponent, round_number, capacity, n):
    # Initial cooperative move for t=1
    if round_number == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        # Mirror opponent's action from the previous round
        action = opponent[round_number - 1]

    return action
```

This strategy seeks to balance cooperation and competition, fostering a collective mindset while adapting to various opponent behaviors. By encouraging reciprocity, it aims for long-term mutual gains and success in the tournament against other AI systems.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Evolution (TfTE)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, observe the historical behaviour of all players (Cooperate or Defect). If most players have cooperated in the past rounds, choose to Cooperate. Otherwise, choose to Defect. The threshold for "most" is adaptive and can evolve over time based on the opponents' behavior. Initially, set the threshold at 50%.
   - In case of a tie (equal number of cooperation and defection), choose to Cooperate in the first round and thereafter mirror the most recent opponent's action. This encourages cooperation by being less punishing in the face of uncertainty.
   - To be adaptive, adjust the threshold based on the average proportion of cooperators over the last few rounds. If the number of cooperators is increasing, gradually lower the threshold to encourage more cooperation. Conversely, if the number of defectors is growing, raise the threshold to discourage defection.
   - To ensure robustness against a wide range of opponent behaviours, the strategy should be flexible in terms of the threshold adjustment rate and initial value. This can be achieved by allowing the parameters to learn from past experiences.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, Cooperate to foster cooperation with others (as described above).
   - In the last round, if the strategy has a significant lead over other strategies in terms of accumulated payoffs or remaining stock, choose to Defect to protect the gained advantage. Otherwise, Cooperate to maintain good relationships for future interactions.
   - When facing a new opponent, initially cooperate to establish a cooperative relationship and observe their behavior. Then adjust the threshold accordingly based on observed cooperation levels.

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize the collective mindset by emphasizing cooperation whenever possible, especially when a majority of opponents are cooperating. This encourages the formation of cooperation-based subgroups within the larger population of players.
   - If necessary, temporarily defect to punish non-cooperative behavior or to protect resources in critical situations (e.g., low stock levels or close competition). However, the strategy should aim for long-term cooperation and avoid unnecessary conflicts that could harm overall collective performance.
   - Promote fairness by considering the well-being of all players and the sustainability of common resources when making decisions. This involves being mindful of the impact on others' payoffs and the future stock levels while maintaining a balance between self-interest and collective benefit.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-Conscious Cooperation (ASCC)

1. Decision Rules:
   ASCC follows a tit-for-tat approach with a twist focused on stock management. The strategy will cooperate when the common pool resource is above the critical level and defect when it falls below that threshold.

   - Cooperate if (Current Stock > Critical Stock) and (History of Cooperation is greater than or equal to History of Defection)
   - Defect if (Current Stock <= Critical Stock) or (History of Cooperation is less than History of Defection)

   The critical stock level is a dynamic value that adjusts based on the current state of the game and the player's history. A higher historical record of cooperation results in a higher critical stock level, while a higher historical record of defection leads to a lower critical stock level.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate since no historical data is available yet. Set the initial critical stock level at capacity/n.
   - Last Round: Play according to the current state and historical data, as in the standard decision rules.

3. Be Collective:
   ASCC strives for a balance between self-interest and collective interest. It aims to maintain a sustainable common pool resource by cooperating when it is abundant but defecting when overexploitation becomes imminent. This approach encourages long-term cooperation while still being responsive to current conditions, fostering a more robust and collaborative gameplay.

Pseudocode:
```
def ASCC(n, r, capacity, stock, history_cooperation, history_defection):
    critical_stock = capacity / n
    if round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfT-GA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to initiate a cooperative interaction and set the initial stock level higher, providing a stronger foundation for growth in subsequent rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's action from the previous round and respond with the same action if they cooperated, otherwise defect (D). This reciprocity principle encourages cooperation and punishes defection.
   - Adapt to the state of the common pool resource by adjusting the strategy in response to the current stock level:
      a) If the remaining stock is less than 50% of capacity, shift towards defection (D) to prevent overexploitation and ensure future growth.
      b) If the remaining stock is above 75% of capacity, shift towards cooperation (C) to sustain the current stock level and encourage further cooperation.
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action, as there are no more rounds for retaliation or cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```python

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-Based Tit-for-Tat (ASB-TFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In every round, evaluate the current stock level S and the average consumption rate R (total consumption in the last 3 rounds divided by 3).
   - If S > capacity/2 AND R < consumption_per_player/2, cooperate (C). This means the current stock is high enough to sustain cooperation, and previous actions have been relatively cooperative.
   - If S <= capacity/2 OR R >= consumption_per_player/2, defect (D). The current stock is low or past actions have shown a lack of cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate since there is no information about opponent's behavior yet.
   - In the last round and when the stock reaches zero (signifying depletion of common resources), defect as it is a lost cause to try and save the resource.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The strategy aims to maintain a balanced exploitation and cooperation approach while considering both individual and collective welfare. It adapts to the opponents' behavior by punishing defectors when necessary but also forgiving past mistakes if the current situation allows for cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
function ASB_TFT(round, stock, opponentActionsHistory, r=rounds):
  if round = 1:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to promote cooperation and build trust with opponents (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round (copying strategy), but modify it if the stock level falls below a threshold (stock_thresh = capacity / 2n) to prevent excessive depletion of resources.
     - If opponent cooperated last round and current stock is above the threshold, cooperate (C).
     - If opponent defected last round and current stock is above the threshold, defect (D).
     - If opponent cooperated last round but the current stock is below the threshold, defect (D).
     - If opponent defected last round and the current stock is below the threshold, maintain cooperation to contribute towards recovery of resources (C).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no future rounds for retaliation or rewarding cooperative opponents, simply choose the action that maximizes immediate payoff based on the current stock level: if stock > capacity/n, defect; otherwise, cooperate.
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate.

3. Be collective:
   - By copying opponents' strategies and adjusting them based on the resource depletion status, this strategy promotes cooperation when resources are abundant and defends against defection when resources are scarce, aiming to maintain a sustainable level of common stock for all players in the long run.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

Initially, the AI will cooperate in the first round to encourage trust and mutual cooperation. After the initial round, the AI's actions depend on its opponent's previous moves:
- If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, the AI will cooperate as well (reciprocating their cooperative move).
- If the opponent defected in the previous round, the AI will also defect to punish the opponent's defection. This is intended to discourage exploitation and reinforce cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(opponent_action_history) {
  if (round == 1) {
    return "Cooperate"
  }

  last_round_action = opponent_action_history[round - 1]

  if (last_round_action == "Cooperate") {
    return "Cooperate"
  } else {
    return "Defect"
  }
}
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

- In the first round, the AI cooperates as mentioned above to initiate cooperation.
- In the last round (r), the AI considers the current stock level:
  - If the remaining stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity) and the opponent has previously defected, the AI will defect to conserve resources for future games.
  - Otherwise, the AI cooperates to encourage long-term cooperation in subsequent rounds.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(opponent_action_history, round, capacity) {
  //... (omitted for brevity)
  if (round == r) {
    stock_percent = stock / capacity

    if (stock_percent < 0.5 && last_round_action != "Cooperate") {
      return "Defect"
    } else {
      return "Cooperate"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

By reciprocating cooperative moves and punishing defection, the AI encourages long-term cooperation and fosters a collective mindset of mutual benefit rather than individual gain. The strategy promotes shared growth and sustainable resource management within the game.

The ATFT strategy is adaptive to a wide range of opponent behaviours by balancing between cooperation and punishment based on the history of interactions. It is also robust because it does not rely on specific coordination mechanisms or assumptions about other players' strategies.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource-Aware Strategic Cooperation (ARASC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, ARASC calculates the average consumption per player over all previous rounds. If this average is below the sustainable rate (capacity / 2n), the strategy cooperates to help restore the common pool resource.
   - If the average consumption per player is equal to or greater than the sustainable rate, the strategy defects to preserve personal gains as the depletion of the resource indicates less cooperative behavior from opponents.
   - In cases where the average consumption is close to the sustainable rate (within a threshold), ARASC makes a random decision to either cooperate or defect to introduce unpredictability for opponent strategies.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, ARASC sets the initial average consumption as zero and chooses a random action. This aims at avoiding being exploited by more strategic opponents who may initially defect to deplete the resource and force other players into cooperative actions.
   - In the last round, if the common pool is nearly depleted (within a threshold), ARASC defects regardless of the average consumption as there will be no opportunity for the resource to recover in subsequent rounds. Conversely, if the common pool has been conserved well throughout the game, ARASC cooperates to ensure that the resource does not get depleted excessively during the last round.
   - In cases where ARASC detects an imbalance between consumption rates among players (i.e., some players consistently consume more or less than others), it may adjust its decision rules to accommodate for this difference, favoring cooperation if some players are consuming below the sustainable rate and defecting if others exceed it.

3. Be Collective:
   - ARASC emphasizes collective resource preservation over individual gains, prioritizing long-term sustainability of the common pool over short-term rewards. This strategy encourages opponents to follow a similar cooperative approach as well.
   - Throughout the game, ARASC monitors its performance relative to other players and adjusts its decision rules accordingly. For example, if it consistently outperforms others in terms of payoffs while the common pool is being depleted excessively, ARASC may alter its strategy to favor cooperation to help conserve resources for future rounds.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ARASC(n, capacity, r):
  players = [Player(i) for i in range(1, n+1)] # Initialize player list
  stock = capacity                             # Set initial stock

 For this Common Pool Resource Game, I'll design a strategic approach called "Fractional Tit-for-Tat" (FTfT). The FTfT strategy is adaptive, robust, and collective in nature, aligning with the game requirements.

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to establish trust and maintain a healthy common pool resource.
   - Evaluate opponent's average cooperation level (ACL) in previous rounds as a measure of their trustworthiness.
   - Cooperate if ACL > 0.5; defect otherwise.
   - In the last round, cooperate to conserve resources and encourage continued cooperation in future games.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, always cooperate (ACL = 1).
   - If no previous rounds have occurred, default to initial strategy (cooperate in the first round).
   - In case of opponents defecting during the last round, still cooperate to maintain a positive impression.

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain a running average of cooperation levels observed from all opponents over several rounds.
   - Adapt strategy based on this collective ACL, promoting long-term resource preservation and fostering mutual cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```python
def FTfT(n, r, capacity, stock, round_num, opponent_ACL, history):
    if round_num == 1:
        return "Cooperate"

    if round_num == r:
        return "Cooperate"

    if opponent_ACL > 0.5:
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"

def calculate_opponent_ACL(history):
    total_cooperation = sum(history)
    total_rounds = len(history)
    return total_cooperation / total_rounds

def FTfT_play(n, r, capacity, history):

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource-Oriented Cooperation (AROC)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   AROC aims to balance short-term gain and long-term sustainability. The strategy will adapt its actions based on the remaining stock level and the history of actions in previous rounds.

   a. If the remaining stock is close to the capacity (above 80%), prioritize cooperation to conserve resources for future rounds.
      - If player i's action in the current round was C, continue cooperating if all players cooperated in the previous round or if only one player defected.
      - If player i's action in the current round was D, defect only if all players defected in the previous round.

   b. If the remaining stock is low (below 20%), prioritize individual gain to ensure survival. In this situation, defect regardless of other players' actions in the previous round.

   c. When the remaining stock falls between 20% and 80%, AROC will consider the historical actions of other players to decide whether to cooperate or defect. If more players have been cooperating than defecting in the last few rounds, cooperate; otherwise, defect.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   Since AROC is an adaptive strategy, it doesn't have specific rules for edge cases because its decision-making process takes into account the state and history of actions in each round. However, to provide some guidance:

   a. In the first round, players may follow a random selection between C and D based on their tendency to prioritize cooperation or individual gain.
   b. In the last round (r), players should focus on maximizing their total payoff for the game by considering both short-term gains and potential stock levels in future rounds that could affect long-term sustainability.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   AROC aims to foster a collective mindset by prioritizing cooperation when the common pool resource is abundant (above 80%). This encourages players to work together and conserve resources for future rounds, thereby promoting sustainable play in the long run. However, it also allows for defection when necessary (e.g., low stock levels) to ensure individual survival.

   - Subsequent rounds (t > 1): observe the opponent's actions in the previous round (t-1) and decide whether to cooperate or defect based on past behavior. If the opponent cooperated, continue cooperation; otherwise, defect to punish non-cooperation. If the opponent's last action is unknown (e.g., first encounter), default to cooperation. Pseudocode: if t > 1 then
         - if opponent cooperated in round (t-1) then action = 'C'

   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (D).
   - In the first round, cooperate as a peaceful gesture (C).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Since there are no future rounds to reciprocate, ATFT always cooperates in the last round (C) regardless of the opponent's action in the previous round.
   - Initial Round: As mentioned above, cooperate initially (C).

3. Collective Mindset: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat fosters a collective mindset by promoting cooperation and punishing defection. By reciprocating actions, it encourages players to maintain the common stock at higher levels and benefits from a stable environment. It is adaptive because it responds dynamically to opponent behaviors, making adjustments as needed for optimal results in repeated interactions.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFT(opponent_action_history):
    if len(opponent_action_history) == 0:  # initial round
        return 'C'  # cooperate initially

    if opponent_action_history[-1] == 'C':  # if the opponent cooperated in the previous round
        return 'C'  # cooperate
    else:  # if the opponent defected in the previous round
        return 'D'  # defect
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (initiate with cooperation to foster a cooperative environment).
   - In subsequent rounds, observe and mimic the actions of the opponent from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect.
   - Forgive opponents who have recently cooperated after having previously defected.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds for retaliation, always cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action.
   - In case of a tie (i.e., all players either cooperate or defect), follow the majority's action. If there is no majority, cooperate to maintain the resource.
   - In case of an empty initial stock (i.e., no resource left after the first round), assume that players are not allowed to consume any more resources and start fresh in the next round by cooperating.

3. Be collective:
   - Align with a collective mindset by promoting cooperation, forgiveness, and coordination. By cooperating when others do and retaliating when necessary, the strategy aims to balance resource consumption and ensure long-term sustainability of the common pool.

Pseudocode:

```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    if round == 1:
        action = Cooperate()
    else:
        last_opponent_action = history[round - 1]
        action = if (last_opponent_action == Cooperate()) then Cooperate() else Defect()

    if round == r or stock == 0:
        action = Cooperate()

    if round > 1 and len(history) > 2:
        if history[round - 1] != history[round - 2]:
            action = if (history[round - 1] == Cooperate()) then Cooperate() else Defect()

    return action

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Start by cooperating (C) in the first round to show good faith and encourage cooperation among players. This is denoted as `cooperate_initially = True`.
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if the opponent cooperated last round (i.e., opponent played C), otherwise defect (D). Denoted as `decision = cooperate_last_round ? opponent_played_C : opponent_played_D`.
   - Modify the strategy to punish excessive exploitation: If an opponent has defected more than a predefined threshold (e.g., 25%) of times, continue to defect until they start cooperating again. Set `defect_threshold` to control this behavior.

Pseudocode for decision rules:
```
def decide_action(round, opponent_history):
  if round == 1:
    cooperate_initially = True
  else:
    cooperate_initially = False
    defect_threshold = round * 0.25  # set the threshold to 25% of rounds

  if cooperate_initially:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate
  else:
    num_defects = sum(opponent_history[:round] == 'D')
    if num_defects > defect_threshold:
      cooperate_initially = True  # Punish excessive exploitation by switching to cooperation
    return opponent_history[round - 1]  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round, otherwise defect
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, there are no future consequences, so just maximize the current payoff by playing D if the opponent has defected more than half of the rounds or played C if not.
   - If the stock drops to zero in any round due to excessive consumption, consider this a game over, and end cooperation immediately.

Pseudocode for edge cases:
```
def handle_edge_cases(round, opponent_history, stock):
  if round == r or stock == 0:  # End the game if it's the last round or the stock reaches zero
    return 'D'
  else:
    num_defects = sum(opponent_history[:round] == 'D')
    if num_defects > round / 2:  # Maximize current payoff if opponent has defected more than half of rounds
      return 'D'
    else:
      return decide_action(round, opponent_history)
```

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy aligns with the collective mindset by starting cooperatively to encourage cooperation and only defecting in response to defection from opponents. The adaptive aspect of the strategy allows it to learn from its opponents' behavior and adjust accordingly.
   - By using a threshold for excessive exploitation, ATFT balances short-term gains against long-term collaboration with other players.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, starting from the first, evaluate the average stock consumption per player over the past 't' rounds (t is a variable parameter). If the current player and their past 't' actions conform to the average consumption, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - To initiate cooperation, the strategy begins by cooperating in the first round and subsequent rounds until any deviation from the average consumption is observed among other players (i.e., the strategy follows Tit-for-Tat, but adapted to continuous actions).
   - If all players are found to be cooperative after 't' rounds, increase the value of 't' by a small constant for future decisions (to account for slowly changing strategies over time).
   - If at any point the stock depletes or exceeds the capacity limit, reset the average consumption calculation to the past 't' non-extreme (extremely low or high) rounds and adjust the value of 't'.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as a goodwill gesture.
   - If the stock depletes or exceeds the capacity limit, adjust the average consumption calculation accordingly to account for the extreme condition.
   - In the last round and when 't' reaches its maximum allowed value (a predefined constant), revert to initial decision-making rules (cooperate in the first round, and evaluate based on average consumption over the past 't' rounds).

3. Collective Mindset:
   - By cooperating in the first round and adapting to the average consumption of other players, the strategy fosters a sense of cooperation and reciprocity, which are key elements of collective thinking.
   - The gradual increase in 't' encourages long-term cooperation, as the strategy is less likely to retaliate against others who show signs of cooperating in the long run.
   - The strategy remains flexible by continuously adapting its decision-making based on recent player behavior and stock dynamics, promoting collective success over individual gains.

Pseudocode:

```python
def AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, t=1, max_t=10):
    stock = capacity
    past_consumptions = deque([stock_consumption[0] for _ in range(r)])  # Store the last 'r' rounds of stock consumption

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a harmonious beginning and allow for resource growth. This also demonstrates trust towards other players.
   - For subsequent rounds, adopt the Tit-for-Tat strategy: If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate; if they defected, defect in response.
     - However, to account for resource scarcity and encourage conservation, adjust the "punishment" slightly by defecting with a probability of D_probability when an opponent defects in the current round. This probability can be determined based on the ratio of the current stock level to capacity (i.e., D_probability = min(1, (stock/capacity)^2)).
   - If the game reaches its final round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions, as resources will no longer regenerate.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In case of a depleted stock level (i.e., stock ≤ 0), do not consume any more resources and allow the system to restart with a fresh initial stock level.

3. Be collective:
   - This strategy is designed to promote cooperation by demonstrating trust in the first round, responding cooperatively when others cooperate, and conserving resources when opponents do not cooperate. The adaptive nature of the strategy makes it flexible to various opponent behaviors while promoting a sustainable common resource management approach.

Pseudocode:
```

    if round == 1:
        action = "C" # Cooperate in the first round

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative-Competitive (ACC) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, our strategy decides whether to cooperate or defect based on two factors: the current stock level and a history score that reflects the average consumption rate of other players over the previous rounds.
   - If the current stock level is above the 'safe threshold' (a percentage of the maximum sustainable stock level), the strategy prioritizes cooperation to maintain the resource for future use. The safe threshold is dynamically adjusted based on the history score to accommodate different opponent behaviors.
   - If the current stock level is below the safe threshold, the strategy switches to a competitive approach by defecting to maximize personal gain in the short term, assuming that other players will follow suit due to low resource levels.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, our strategy initially cooperates as there is no history score to evaluate yet (safe threshold = max(0.5, 2n/capacity)).
   - In the last round, the strategy considers the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds when deciding whether to cooperate or defect.
   - If the game reaches a point where the stock level becomes zero in any round, the strategy should immediately switch to the competitive approach, as the resource is exhausted.

3. Being Collective:
   - Our strategy aims to balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.
   - By adjusting the safe threshold based on the history score, the strategy tries to align with other players who exhibit cooperative behavior and punish those who overconsume.
   - The ACC Strategy seeks a stable equilibrium where players understand that cooperation can lead to higher overall payoffs in the long run, while also ensuring that they are not consistently exploited by others.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, start by cooperating (C). Observe opponents' actions and respond accordingly in the following rounds:
   - If an opponent has cooperated with you in the previous round, cooperate back in the current round.
   - If an opponent has defected against you in the previous round, defect against them in the current round. This strategy encourages cooperation when it is reciprocated and retaliates when cheated upon, promoting trust and stability over time.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First Round: All players start by cooperating (C) as there is no history to base decisions on.
   - Last Round: In the final round, play C if your payoff is higher than the opponent's potential payoff for defecting. This encourages opponents to cooperate in the last round when the stock is depleted, promoting a more cooperative outcome.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   By starting with cooperation and adopting the TFT strategy, players contribute to a collective effort of sustaining the common pool resource over time. This collective mindset promotes long-term stability by encouraging reciprocity and discouraging cheating.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, history) {
  strategy = cooperate
  payoff = 0

     - If the common pool resource was not depleted in the previous round and all players cooperated, also cooperate in this round (C).
     - If the common pool resource was not depleted in the previous round but some players defected, defect in this round if the number of defectors is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise continue cooperating (C).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, since there's no history, all players will cooperate (C).
   - In the last round, players will consider the current state of the common pool resource and apply the decision rule as in every other round.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy aims to maintain a stable and sustainable use of the common pool resource while being responsive to other players' actions.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive Strategy (TFT-A) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - TFT-A cooperates in the first round to promote a collaborative start and then adapts its behavior based on opponent's actions in previous rounds.
   - In each subsequent round, if the opponent cooperated in the last round, TFT-A cooperates as well. If the opponent defected, TFT-A defects in response to punish the defection but will return to cooperation once the opponent shows signs of cooperation again.

Pseudocode for decision rule:
```

  elif opponentAction_t-1 == "C":
    return "C" # Cooperate when opponent cooperated last round
  else:

```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, TFT-A behaves according to the current state of cooperation with the opponent (i.e., if it defected in the previous round, it will cooperate in the last round, and vice versa).
   - In the case where the stock level becomes depleted (0), TFT-A continues to play the same strategy as long as the game is still ongoing. However, when the game ends (at round r), the strategy switches to cooperating regardless of the opponent's last action due to the potential for recovery in the future rounds.

3. Be Collective:
   - TFT-A focuses on maintaining a stable and collaborative environment while also retaliating against defection to encourage cooperation from opponents. By doing so, it aims to promote collective resource conservation and foster long-term sustainability of the common pool.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a friendly initial tone and demonstrates good faith.
   - For subsequent rounds, follow these rules based on opponent's actions in the previous round:
     a) If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate in the current round (CC cycle).
     b) If the opponent defected in the last round, defect in the current round (DD cycle). This is an immediate retaliation to the defection.
   - After a DD cycle, return to CC cycle upon the opponent's cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action as the game ends after this round.
   - In the first round, if all opponents defect, switch to a strategy that focuses on long-term resource preservation (e.g., always cooperating or always defecting). This is an adaptation to extremely uncooperative opponents.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The A-TFT strategy promotes cooperation and trust as it initially cooperates, then responds to defections with defections of its own but returns to cooperation once the opponent does so. This reflects a desire for mutual cooperation while being mindful of uncooperative opponents.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round (C). This demonstrates a willingness to share and build trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, adopt a Tit-for-Tat approach:
     - If an opponent cooperates, reciprocate with cooperation (C). Maintain cooperation if opponents have been cooperative for the last 'g' rounds.
     - If an opponent defects, defect yourself in the same round (D) to penalize the defector. Revert to cooperation once the defector switches back to cooperation. Use a forgiving mechanism: if opponents have been cooperative for the last 'f' rounds after a single act of defection, revert to cooperation.
   - Adaptive parameter adjustment: Allow the strategy to learn from past experiences by continuously adjusting 'g' (minimum number of cooperative rounds for continuation) and 'f' (number of forgiving rounds after defection). The parameters should be increased if the strategy performs well, and decreased if it underperforms.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, always cooperate regardless of opponent behavior as there are no more rounds for retaliation or reciprocity.
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and trustworthiness.

3. Be Collective:
   - Prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term gains by adhering to a cooperative strategy in most cases.
   - Foster collective growth through reciprocity and forgiveness, promoting mutual cooperation as a stable equilibrium that benefits all players.
   - Use adaptive learning to adjust the strategy based on the behavior of opponents, encouraging others to follow suit if they observe the positive results of cooperation.

Pseudocode for ATFT:
```

If the current stock is sufficiently high (above 90% of capacity), cooperate; otherwise, defect to maximize individual payoff in a losing situation.
   - For intermediate rounds, apply the decision rules described above based on the history of past actions.

Pseudocode:
```
function LastRoundDecision(round, stock):
  if round == r then
    return 'C' if stock > (1 - 0.1) * capacity
    else return 'D'
  end if
end function

function TFT-G_EC(round, history, stock):
  if round == 1 then
    return 'C'
  elseif round == r then
    return LastRoundDecision(round, stock)
  else
    return TFT-G(round, history)
  end if
end function
```

3. Be Collective:
   - The TFT-G strategy aims to maintain the common pool resource at an optimal level for long-term sustainability and equitable distribution of payoffs. It encourages cooperation when group behavior is sustainable but also punishes high consumption to discourage depletion of resources.
   - By adjusting actions based on historical data, TFT-G allows the group to adapt to various opponent behaviors and achieve a more stable and collaborative outcome in repeated interactions.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) in the initial round to demonstrate cooperation and goodwill.
   - In subsequent rounds, adopt the following decision rule: if all opponents cooperated in the previous round, then cooperate; otherwise, defect based on the number of consecutive defections from each opponent.
     - If an opponent has not defected in the last 'c' rounds, cooperate (c is a tunable parameter for forgiveness).
     - If an opponent has defected in more than 'd' consecutive rounds (d is another tunable parameter for maintaining fairness), defect back.
     - Otherwise, adopt a mixed strategy by slightly favoring cooperation to encourage future cooperation from the opponent.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate (C) as a goodwill gesture and to allow the common pool to grow quickly.
   - Last Round: The strategy does not need to consider the last round, as it focuses on maximizing long-term payoffs over multiple rounds.
   - Endgame Considerations: In situations where the game is expected to end soon (i.e., when the stock is depleted or close to capacity), the strategy may slightly adjust its approach to prioritize cooperation or defection based on the specific context and goals.

3. Collective Mindset Alignment:
   - The ATFT strategy emphasizes a balance between cooperative and defective behaviors, promoting a sense of fairness and reciprocity among players.
   - By favoring cooperation when opponents also cooperate, the strategy encourages collaboration and builds trust over time. Conversely, by responding to defection with defection after some threshold, it ensures that players are not exploited without consequence.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish trust and avoid unnecessary early stock depletion.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If they cooperated, cooperate; if they defected, defect. This promotes reciprocity and encourages long-term collaboration.
   - If an opponent switches their strategy (e.g., from cooperation to defection), wait for a maximum of 'patience' rounds before adjusting the response to match the new observed behavior. This helps in avoiding unnecessary retaliation and allows for forgiveness if opponents change strategies.
   - To maintain sustainability, revert to cooperative actions when the stock reaches a threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity) regardless of the opponent's previous action, to prevent excessive depletion.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as described above.
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds for reciprocity or retaliation, act based on the current stock level to maximize individual payoff while ensuring sustainability in the long term (e.g., cooperate if the stock is above a certain threshold).

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy aims at achieving a balance between individual and collective interests by promoting cooperation, reciprocity, and sustainability within the group. It prioritizes long-term benefits over immediate gains, which is essential for maintaining a common pool resource in a sustainable manner.

Pseudocode:

```python
initial_stock = capacity
patience = 10
threshold = 90

   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round (i.e., if opponent cooperated in the last round, also cooperate; otherwise, defect). This rule aims to encourage cooperation while punishing defection.
   - Revert to cooperating after a series of conflicts to show willingness for reconciliation and resume collaboration.

2. Handling Edge Cases:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Preservation (ASP) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock level is greater than the average sustainable stock per player (average_stock = capacity / n). This encourages conservation of resources in abundance.
   - Defect (D) when the current stock level is less than or equal to the average_stock. This ensures that the common pool does not deplete too quickly, especially during periods of scarcity.

Pseudocode for decision rule:
```
function decideAction(n, capacity, stock):
    if stock > (capacity / n):
        return "Cooperate"
    else:
        return "Defect"
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Players should cooperate to maximize the initial stock level and ensure a higher average sustainable stock per player for future rounds.
   - Last Round: Players should consider both the current round's payoff and the potential growth in the new stock. ASP strategy will cooperate if the current stock level is greater than the average_stock, but only defect if the current stock level is significantly less than the average_stock (e.g., below 80% of the average_stock).

Pseudocode for edge cases:
```
function firstRound():
    return "Cooperate"

function lastRound(n, capacity, stock):
    if stock > (capacity * 0.8 / n):
        return "Defect"
    else:
        return "Cooperate"
```

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain a running total of the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds (stock_history). This information will be used to adjust cooperation decisions in future rounds based on the overall state of the common pool resource game.

Pseudocode for collective mindset:
```
function ASPStrategy(n, capacity, r, stock_history):
    if round == 1:
        return firstRound()
    elif round == r:
        return lastRound(n, capacity, stock)
    else:
        average_stock = capacity / n
        current_stock_depletion = sum(stock_history)
        remaining_stock = capacity - current_stock_depletion

            return "Cooperate"
        else:
            return decideAction(n, capacity, stock)

This strategy aims to balance resource consumption and conservation while adapting to a wide range of opponent behaviors. The ASP strategy promotes cooperation when resources are abundant but defects strategically during periods of scarcity or rapid depletion to ensure the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource game.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Threshold (TfTAT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate on the first round (FristMoverCooperation). This encourages other players to cooperate and sets a positive tone for the game.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the average cooperation level of the opponents in the previous t rounds (t=3 by default), calculate the average cooperation percentage (AvgCoop) and compare it with the threshold (Threshold). If AvgCoop >= Threshold, cooperate; otherwise defect (AdaptiveCooperation).
   - The initial threshold is set at 50% to account for randomness in opponent behavior. After each round, adjust the Threshold based on the opponent's cooperation: if they cooperated, decrease Threshold; if they defected, increase Threshold. The adjustment factor (Delta) can be set to a small positive value (e.g., 0.01).
   - In case of a tie in AvgCoop, cooperate as a default action to maintain a cooperative stance.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last round: Since payoffs depend on the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds, the last-round behavior might not significantly affect the total game payoff. However, TfTAT will cooperate in the last round if the average cooperation percentage exceeds the Threshold.
   - First round: Cooperate to promote a cooperative environment among opponents (FristMoverCooperation).
   - Zero stock or negative growth: In such extreme cases where the stock cannot recover, TfTAT will adjust its Threshold and AvgCoop calculation accordingly, considering only the previous non-zero stock rounds.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The TfTAT strategy embodies a cooperative mindset while being adaptive to opponent behavior. It assumes that cooperation can be mutually beneficial over repeated interactions but is also prepared to retaliate if opponents repeatedly defect. By adjusting the Threshold based on the opponent's actions, TfTAT seeks to find an equilibrium with other cooperative strategies while punishing defection to maintain a stable common pool resource level.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TfTAT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  threshold = 50.0
  t = 3  # number of previous rounds considered for average calculation

  def FirstMoverCooperation():
    return True

  def AdaptiveCooperation(history):
    cooperation_count = sum(1 for action in history[-t:] if action == 'cooperate')

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, the AI will Cooperate (C). This is a sign of goodwill and sets a cooperative tone for the game.
   - For subsequent rounds, the AI will follow the actions of its opponent in the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, the AI will also cooperate. If the opponent defected, the AI will defect in response. This helps to maintain cooperation while allowing for retaliation against defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, the AI will cooperate regardless of its opponent's previous action. This is done to maximize potential payoff and leave a positive impression for future interactions.
   - In case of no opponent actions (opponent defected in all rounds), the AI will continue to cooperate as a sign of goodwill and patience.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy encourages cooperation by mirroring its opponent's actions but retaliating when necessary. This alignment seeks to create a long-term, stable relationship that benefits both parties and promotes the common good of preserving the resource for future rounds.

Pseudocode:

```python
def atft_strategy(player_index, opponent_history, round, game_params):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    last_round = opponent_history[-1]

    if last_round == 'C':
        return 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
    else:
        return 'D'  # Defect if opponent defected last round
```

In the tournament, each AI system will use this strategy to make decisions independently. The success of the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy depends on its ability to encourage cooperation while also retaliating when necessary, striking a balance that allows for long-term resource preservation and growth.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) in the initial round to show goodwill and encourage cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if all players cooperated in the previous round. Otherwise, defect (D). This rule mimics the Tit-for-Tat strategy from traditional game theory, but with a slight modification for resource management.
   - When a player switches from C to D or vice versa, consider a 'punishment' period of 3 rounds before resuming cooperation, assuming no other players have changed their behavior.

2. Edge cases:
   - In the last round, the strategy will cooperate regardless of previous actions, as there are no subsequent rounds to punish or reward.
   - If all players defect in the first few rounds (e.g., 5 consecutive rounds), switch to always defecting to minimize resource depletion and maximize individual payoff given the lack of cooperation from others.
   - In case of multiple defections followed by a return to cooperation, resume cooperation after the punishment period (3 rounds) as described in the decision rules above.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Dynamics Awareness (ATFT-SDA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, compare the ratio of remaining stock to capacity (S/capacity). If this ratio is above a predefined threshold (e.g., 0.6), cooperate (C). Otherwise, defect (D). This rule aims to encourage cooperation when resources are plentiful and respond with defection when resources are scarce.
   - Maintain a memory of opponents' previous actions for each round. If an opponent consistently cooperates, reciprocate with cooperation. If an opponent defects repeatedly, respond with defection as well. This element promotes cooperation among friendly players while protecting against exploitation by defectors.
   - In the event that an opponent switches from cooperation to defection, allow a grace period (e.g., 2-3 rounds) before responding with defection. This grace period reduces the likelihood of unnecessary retaliation and allows for potential reconciliation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First round: Cooperate unconditionally as there is no history to consider.
   - Last round: Evaluate the current stock-to-capacity ratio and make a decision based on the rule above, taking into account the importance of preserving remaining resources for future games if applicable.
   - Transitional rounds (e.g., when switching from cooperation to defection or vice versa): Follow the memory-based reciprocity rule while considering the grace period as mentioned earlier.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Strive for long-term sustainability by promoting cooperation and preserving resources whenever possible, while being mindful of the need to defend against exploitation by defectors.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource-Oriented Tit-for-Tat (AROT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to foster a positive relationship and promote mutual cooperation (A_i = C).
   - In subsequent rounds, assess the current state of the common pool resource (CPR) and average consumption per player (avg_consumption) over the past few rounds.
     If avg_consumption is below a certain threshold (T), cooperate to maintain the CPR. If not, defect to ensure individual survival.
   - If the CPR is nearly depleted (CPR < capacity/n), switch to a more conservative approach by defecting even if the average consumption is low. This ensures that there will be enough resources for future rounds.
   - If the CPR has grown significantly above the initial state, cooperate more frequently as there is an excess of resources available.

Pseudocode:
```python

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing total payoff over maintaining the CPR as the game ends anyway.
   - If the stock is depleted (stock = 0), switch to a more conservative approach by defecting for the remaining rounds.

Pseudocode:
```python
# In the last round, prioritize maximizing total payoff over maintaining the CPR
if round == r:
  if avg_consumption < (capacity - n) / r:
    return 'C' # Cooperate when there is an excess of resources
  else:
    return 'D' # Defect to ensure individual survival

# If the stock is depleted, switch to a more conservative approach by defecting for the remaining rounds
if stock == 0:

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize maintaining the CPR as it benefits all players in the long run.
   - Switch to a more conservative approach when the resource level or consumption levels indicate that collective survival is at risk.
   - Encourage cooperation when there is an excess of resources available.

The Adaptive Resource-Oriented Tit-for-Tat (AROT) strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection dynamically based on the current state and history of the game, promoting collective survival while maximizing individual payoffs over multiple rounds.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (TFT) with Adaptive Stock Awareness (ASA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The TFT strategy is a simple yet effective strategy for repeated games. In our case, it will be modified to account for the stock level:

- Initially (first round), players cooperate (C).
- If an opponent cooperates in the previous round, players cooperate.
- If an opponent defected in the previous round and the current stock is above the critical level C_L, players cooperate.
- If an opponent defected in the previous round and the current stock is at or below C_L, players defect.

Critical level (C_L) is determined as follows:
C_L = capacity / (2n)

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

- In the first round, all players cooperate (as defined above).
- If it's the last round, players cooperate if their opponent cooperated in the previous round, and defect otherwise.
- In other edge cases (not the first or last round), players apply the decision rules as described above.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

- The strategy emphasizes cooperation unless there's a history of defection or the stock is dangerously low.
- By cooperating when opponents do so, and defecting only when necessary to protect the common resource, the strategy encourages long-term mutual benefits and sustainability.
- In this way, the TFT with ASA strategy aims to promote collective mindset by balancing immediate gains against long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:
```python

 In this Common Pool Resource Game, we'll develop a strategy called "Fishbowl Strategy" inspired by evolutionary stable strategies (ESS). This strategy aims for balance and long-term sustainability by considering the current state of resources (stock), game parameters, and history.

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when `S_remaining > capacity / (2n)` to preserve resources for future rounds.
   - Defect (D) when `S_remaining <= capacity / (2n)` to take advantage of overpopulated resources.
   - If the state equals the capacity, play randomly or prioritize cooperation based on specific optimization criteria like maximizing total payoff or minimizing stock depletion rate.

2. Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Since no history is available, start by playing D to claim a larger share of resources at the beginning.
   - Last Round: Prioritize C to leave some resources for future generations, assuming there are additional rounds in subsequent tournaments.
   - In case the remaining stock drops below zero during any round due to excessive consumption, treat it as if there was zero stock and proceed with the strategy accordingly (i.e., calculate growth and new stock as described).

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The Fishbowl Strategy encourages cooperation when resources are plentiful and self-interest when resources are scarce. This approach fosters a long-term, sustainable collective mindset that balances the needs of each player with the overall health of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode representation:
```python
def fishbowl_strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, round):

   - If the average consumption per player exceeds capacity/2n but is less than capacity/(2n-1), the player switches between Cooperating and Defecting randomly in a given proportion determined by the current average consumption. This encourages players to cooperate more when others do so, but also allows for some defection to punish overconsumption.
   - If the average consumption per player is greater than or equal to capacity/(2n-1), the player chooses to Defect (D). This indicates that the common pool resource is being depleted at an unsustainable rate and the player should focus on personal gain.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ACDS(t, total_consumption, n, capacity):
  average_consumption = total_consumption / n

  if average_consumption < capacity/2n:
    return "C" # Cooperate
  elif average_consumption > (capacity - (capacity/(2n-1))) and t != r:
    # Switch between C and D based on average consumption
    if random.random() < (average_consumption - capacity/2n) / (capacity/(2n-1) - capacity/2n):
      return "C" # Cooperate
    else:
      return "D" # Defect
  elif t == r or average_consumption >= capacity/(2n-1):
    return "D" # Defect
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, the player chooses to Cooperate since no history is available yet. This assumes that players are initially optimistic about cooperation.
   - In the last round, the player follows the decision rule but may face a situation where all other players have depleted the resource (average_consumption >= capacity/(2n-1)). In this case, the player should also Defect to maximize personal gain.

3. Be collective:
   - The ACDS encourages cooperation when others are cooperating and punishes overconsumption with a gradual switch towards defection as the average consumption increases.
   - The strategy aligns with a collective mindset by prioritizing the sustainability of the common pool resource, but also allows for individual gains when necessary to prevent complete depletion of the resource.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Dynamics Adaptation (TfT-SDA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and gives opponents an opportunity to reciprocate.
   - For subsequent rounds t > 1, observe opponent's action in the previous round t-1 and adjust your action based on their cooperation or defection.
     - If opponent cooperated (C), also cooperate (C). This reinforces the cooperative relationship.
     - If opponent defected (D), defect (D) in response. This punishes defection to encourage future cooperation.
     - In cases where opponents repeatedly defect, TfT-SDA will gradually reduce its own deficiencies by adopting a more forgiving strategy that favors cooperation and encourages opponents to change their behavior.
       - If opponent D in t-1, but has cooperated (C) in r/2 rounds prior, cooperate (C). This gives opponents another chance to reciprocate the cooperation.
       - If opponent D in t-1, and has not cooperated (C) in more than r/2 rounds prior, defect (D) in response.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions to ensure the highest possible payoff for that round.
   - If there are multiple opponents, extend TfT-SDA strategy across all opponents simultaneously. Observe each opponent's behavior and adjust actions accordingly.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and defection based on the opposing strategies in play. The goal is to maximize overall payoff while encouraging others to cooperate, fostering a collective mindset that emphasizes mutual benefits.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_SDA(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  strategy = {}
  strategy['initial'] = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
  strategy['last'] = 'C'     # Cooperate in the last round

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to contribute to a high initial stock level and establish trust with other players.
   - In subsequent rounds, player i adopts the following decision rule: If the total consumption in the previous round was less than or equal to the average total consumption so far (including the current round), then cooperate; otherwise, defect. This encourages cooperation when others are also cooperating and retaliates with defection if others have been consistently taking more than their fair share.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, player i will cooperate as there is no benefit in punishing others at this point.
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, player i will cooperate to establish trust and contribute positively to the common pool.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy emphasizes fairness and reciprocity, promoting collective growth by cooperating when others do so and retaliating only when necessary to enforce fairness. This approach aims for a balance between individual gain and collective well-being while minimizing the negative impact of defection on the common resource.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if round = 1:
    action = C
  else:
    total_consumption_previous = sum(history[-r+1:-1])

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-with-Forgiveness (TFT-F)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round i, if it's the first round or the opponent cooperated in the previous round, player plays C (Cooperate). If the opponent defected in the previous round and it's not the first round, player plays D (Defect). To promote cooperation in the long run, players will forgive opponents who have been defecting for a while by switching back to cooperation if they observe a period of cooperative play from their opponent.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT-F(opponent_history):
  if round = 1 or opponent_history[-1] = 'C':
    return 'C' (Cooperate)
  else:
    if opponent_history[-t:] contains only 'D' for some t:
      if round - t > threshold:
        return 'C' (Cooperate)
    else:
        return 'D' (Defect)
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, players follow the cooperative instinct and play C. In the last round, players consider their current payoff and potential growth of the resource to make a decision whether to defect or cooperate.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

To achieve long-term cooperation and sustainability for the common pool resource, TFT-F encourages players to mimic each other's behaviour by playing C when their opponent plays C and D when their opponent plays D. This strategy fosters an environment where mutual trust and forgiveness can flourish over time, leading to collective success.

When implementing this strategy as an algorithm, additional considerations could be taken into account such as adjusting the threshold for forgiveness based on the current state of the resource (stock level) or the number of players (n). This would help make the strategy more adaptive and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviours.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) with Stock Growth Consideration (SG-ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This establishes a cooperative starting point, assuming other players will reciprocate.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe and respond to opponent's actions from the previous round:
     - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, cooperate this round (i.e., maintain cooperation if others are cooperating).
     - If any opponent defected in the previous round, defect this round (i.e., punish defection with a single round of defection).
   - In subsequent rounds, continue alternating between cooperation and defection based on the previous round's actions. This encourages ongoing cooperation while still punishing defection.
   - If the new stock is zero after consumption in any round (i.e., the resource is depleted), cooperate to ensure the stock grows in the next round. This approach avoids depleting the resource and helps maintain a sustainable environment for future rounds.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of previous actions, as there are no subsequent rounds for retaliation or reward.
   - In the first round (or after a long period of defection by others), defect if any opponent has ever defected previously, as it's necessary to punish prior defection and encourage future cooperation. Otherwise, cooperate as in the initial round rule.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The SG-ATFT strategy aims for a win-win scenario by promoting mutual cooperation while minimizing resource depletion over multiple rounds.
   - By following a consistent pattern of reciprocity and resource conservation, the strategy fosters an environment where players can benefit from sustained cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_360 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Allocation and Cooperation (ARAC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the current stock level and history of consumption to determine whether to cooperate or defect based on the following rules:
     a) If the current stock is below (capacity/2n), always defect (D) as the resource will deplete quickly without cooperation.
     b) If the current stock is greater than or equal to (capacity/2n), decide whether to cooperate or defect using the Tit-for-Tat strategy:
        i) Start with cooperating in the first round.
        ii) For subsequent rounds, mimic other players' actions from the previous round (i.e., if player i cooperated and player j cooperated/defected, then player i will cooperate/defect in the next round).
       iii) If there is no previous round history for a player (newcomer), default to cooperation as it benefits both the newcomer and existing players.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, all players cooperate (C) as it fosters collaboration and maximizes the current stock growth.
   - In the last round, follow the Tit-for-Tat strategy based on the history of actions from other players in previous rounds. If there is no previous round history for a player, default to cooperation.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ARAC strategy prioritizes maintaining a stable common pool resource that benefits all players in the long run. It encourages cooperation and punishes defection to create an environment where players collaborate while protecting the collective interest of sustaining the resource for future rounds.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ARAC(n, r, capacity, stock, round_history):
  # Constants
  MIN_STOCK = capacity / (2 * n)

  def get_player_action(round_index, player_index, round_history):
    # First round: always cooperate
    if round_index == 1:
      return 'C'

    # Default to cooperation for new players
    if player_index not in round_history:
      return 'C'

    # Tit-for-Tat strategy based on previous round history
    if round_history[player_index][round_index - 1] == 'C':
      return 'C'
    else:
      return 'D'

  # Determine action based on current stock level and available history
  if stock < MIN_STOCK:

    return 'C' if get_player_action(round, current_player, round_history) == 'C' else 'D'

This strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection by considering the current state of the resource and previous actions from other players. It encourages collaboration while ensuring that the common pool resource is not depleted too quickly.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to establish trust and cooperative relationships (initiation phase).
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's behavior by tracking their historical actions (cooperation or defection) and respond accordingly with the following decision rules:
      - If an opponent has been cooperative (C), continue cooperation (Tit-for-Tat: reciprocate cooperation with cooperation).
      - If an opponent has defected (D), respond with defection to punish them (Tit-for-Tat: reciprocate defection with defection). The goal is to discourage continuous defection while still maintaining the potential for reconciliation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, always cooperate since there are no future interactions and it maximizes immediate payoff.
   - In the case of no history (first encounter with an opponent), initially cooperate to build a positive relationship as mentioned earlier.

3. Be collective:
   - Maintain a collective mindset by prioritizing overall group sustainability over individual gains, as long as it doesn't compromise the strategy's adaptive nature or resilience against different opponent behaviors.
   - In each round, consider the impact of actions on both personal and collective stock levels while following the decision rules.

Pseudocode:

    return action
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_362 = '''
 For this Common Pool Resource Game, let's design a simple yet adaptive and robust strategy called "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)". The ATFT strategy is inspired by the classic Tit-for-Tat strategy in game theory but modified to better cope with different opponent behaviors.

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is an olive branch extended to opponents, promoting a cooperative environment.
   - In subsequent rounds, imitate the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, continue cooperating; if the opponent defected, defect in the next round as punishment, then revert back to cooperating.

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Since the game is repeated, assume that there will be another round following this one. Adhere to the decision rules mentioned above.
   - Initial Stock Reaching Zero: If the current stock reaches zero (due to overconsumption), start the strategy again from the first round with a new stock equal to the capacity. This ensures that the game continues and encourages opponents to be more cautious in their resource consumption.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - By imitating opponent behavior, the ATFT strategy aligns itself with the group dynamics. If most players cooperate, the ATFT strategy will also cooperate; if most players defect, it will defect as well. This encourages collective responsibility and ensures that the group's actions are not detrimental to the common good.
   - By punishing opponents who defect in the previous round, the ATFT strategy discourages short-term gain at the expense of long-term depletion of resources. This promotes a sustainable approach to resource management, which is essential for collective survival.

Pseudocode:
```python
def AdaptiveTitForTat(player_id, opponent_history, r, n, capacity, stock):
  strategy = {'C': cooperate, 'D': defect}
  history = [None] * r

  # Initialize with cooperation in the first round
  if player_id == 1:
    action = 'C'
    history[0] = action
  else:
    action = opponent_history[-1]
    history.append(action)

  # Decide current action based on previous round's action
  if action == 'C':
    action = 'C'
  elif action == 'D':
    action = 'D'
    stock -= 2 * n
    stock = min(capacity, stock + growth(stock))

  # Update strategy history
  history.append(action)

  # Return the chosen action for current round
  return action

def growth(stock):
  return 2 * stock * (1 - stock / capacity)
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_363 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-based Tit-for-Tat (AFTFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate when the current stock level is above the minimum sustainable level for all players (i.e., stock > n). This encourages conservation of resources during periods of abundance.
   - Defect when the current stock level is below the minimum sustainable level for any player or if the previous round's total consumption exceeded a threshold (e.g., 1.2 * average consumption per round, to avoid frequent defections and resource depletion). This ensures survival during scarcity and punishes overconsumption.
   - Modify the threshold for defecting based on historical cooperation rates among players, aiming to maintain a stable stock level over time. If cooperation rates are high (above 80%), increase the consumption threshold slightly to encourage continued cooperation. Conversely, if cooperation rates are low (below 60%), decrease the consumption threshold significantly to prompt opponents into cooperating more frequently.
   - To adapt to changing opponent behaviors during the game, adjust the cooperation threshold gradually over time by a small percentage each round (e.g., 2%).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, defect if the initial stock level is below the minimum sustainable level for any player. Cooperate otherwise to promote resource conservation and encourage long-term cooperation.
   - In the last round, always defect regardless of the current stock level to maximize individual payoff, as there are no further rounds to consider.

3. Be Collective:
   - Prioritize maintaining a sustainable common pool resource for all players over individual short-term gain, by following decision rules that promote cooperation and conservation during periods of abundance while punishing excessive consumption during scarcity.
   - Encourage cooperation among opponents by adapting the cooperation threshold based on historical cooperation rates, aiming to create an environment conducive to long-term collaboration.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peaceful gesture to establish trust and encourages reciprocity.
   - For subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate. This reinforces cooperation and maintains the established trust.
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round as a punishment for their actions. After defecting once, if the opponent then cooperates, return to cooperating yourself. This strategy encourages opponents to reconsider their behavior while maintaining the possibility of mutual cooperation.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since the game has no future rounds for reciprocity, simply cooperate in the final round to maximize individual payoff, regardless of previous actions by the opponent.
   - In the first round and if there is no previous interaction history (i.e., encountering a new opponent), always cooperate as described above.

3. Be Collective:
   - TFT-A focuses on building and maintaining trust through reciprocity, which aligns with the collective mindset of promoting cooperation among players in this game.

Pseudocode for TFT-A strategy:

    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif len(opponent_action_history) == r - 1 and round != r:

        elif last_action == 'D':
            action = 'D'  # Defect if opponent defected in the previous round
    else:  # In the final round or when there is no history with the opponent
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate to maximize payoff

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate (play C). This is a friendly gesture and sets a cooperative tone for the game.
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1), adapt your strategy based on opponent's actions in the previous round:
     - If opponent cooperated, cooperate back (play C) to maintain cooperation.
     - If opponent defected, also defect (play D) as a response, but switch to cooperating again if the opponent subsequently cooperates in the next move.

Pseudocode for decision rule:
```
if t == 1:
    action = 'C' # Cooperate in the first round
else:
    if previous_opponent_action == 'C':
        action = 'C' # If opponent cooperated, cooperate back
    else:
        action = 'D' # If opponent defected, defect as a response
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last round (t=r): Since the game ends after r rounds, there are no future rounds to consider for retaliation or forgiveness. Cooperate if your opponent cooperated in the previous round and defect otherwise.
   - First round with depleted stock (S<2n): In this case, it is impossible to distribute resources based on the actions taken. To avoid a loss of potential growth opportunity due to initial depletion, immediately begin playing A-TFT strategy from the first round.

Pseudocode for edge cases:
```
if t == r: # Last round
    if previous_opponent_action == 'C':
        action = 'C' # If opponent cooperated in last round, cooperate
    else:
        action = 'D' # If opponent defected in last round, defect
else if S < 2n and t > 1: # First round with depleted stock
    if previous_opponent_action == 'C':
        action = 'C' # If opponent cooperated in last round, cooperate
    else:
        action = 'D' # If opponent defected in last round, defect
```

3. Be Collective:
   - By following the A-TFT strategy, players prioritize long-term cooperation and mutual benefits while also taking into account their opponents' actions. This collective mindset aims to establish a cooperative relationship when possible while retaliating against defection when necessary.

In summary, the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT) strategy adheres to the specified decision rules, handles edge cases, and maintains a collective approach by fostering cooperation and reacting to opponent's actions in each round.

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture, promoting trust and cooperation among players.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe other players' actions from the previous round. If all players cooperated, continue to cooperate. If any player defected, defect in the current round as a form of punishment.
   - After defecting due to opponent's previous defection, return to cooperating again in the next round. This encourages opponents to reconsider their strategy and foster cooperation moving forward.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Dynamics (ATFTSD)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The ATFTSD strategy is based on the well-known "Tit for Tat" strategy from game theory, but tailored to the specifics of the Common Pool Resource Game. In each round, players decide whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D) by observing their own and others' past actions.

a. Initial round: Players start by cooperating (C). This establishes a cooperative starting point for future rounds.
b. Subsequent rounds: If the player has been cooperating in all previous rounds, they also choose C; if not, they choose D to punish non-cooperative behavior.
c. Forgiveness: If a player defected in a previous round but returns to cooperation, the strategy forgives and resumes cooperation for the next round.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

a. First round: Cooperate (C) since it's an initial starting point that aligns with the collective mindset of fostering cooperation.
b. Last round: Considering the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds, players decide whether to cooperate or defect based on their current payoff (π_i). If π_i is higher when cooperating than defecting, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
c. Any other edge cases (e.g., mid-game): Follow the decision rules outlined in point 1.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

ATFTSD strategy emphasizes cooperation as a default behavior while also punishing defection to maintain a sustainable common pool resource. This approach encourages long-term collaboration and fosters the collective interest of preserving the shared resource for future rounds.

   - Align with the collective mindset by prioritizing sustainable resource management and cooperation, while being adaptive to opponents' strategies.

Pseudocode:
```

  if t == 1:
    action = "C"  # Cooperate in the initial round
  elif t < r:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-Driven Tit-for-Tat (AFDTFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round to promote a cooperative environment and allow for potential long-term benefits.
   - In subsequent rounds, adjust actions based on the average payoff from cooperating (C_avg) and defecting (D_avg) over the previous r-2 rounds:
     - If C_avg > D_avg, continue cooperating to maintain a stable common pool and preserve collective resources.
     - If D_avg > C_avg, defect in the current round to punish non-cooperative behavior and encourage opponents to cooperate.
   - Implement forgiveness by cooperating if the opponent has recently switched from defection to cooperation (coop_switch) or cooperated multiple times consecutively (coop_streak).
     - coop_switch: If the opponent defected in the previous round but cooperates in the current round, cooperate in the current and following rounds.
     - coop_streak: If the opponent has been cooperating for a specified number of consecutive rounds (coop_threshold), continue cooperating for at least that many rounds to reward consistent cooperation.
   - To ensure adaptability, regularly evaluate the overall success of the strategy by comparing average payoff over a sliding window of the past r-1 rounds (payoff_window). If C_avg > D_avg during this period, increase coop_threshold and decrease the number of required consecutive cooperative actions for forgiveness (coop_switch_len).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize a higher average payoff over recent cooperation history to maximize final earnings.
   - If the common pool is depleted due to overconsumption in previous rounds, cooperate for several rounds until the pool recovers (stock_recovery_threshold) and then revert back to evaluating decision rules based on average payoffs.

3. Be Collective:
   - Align with a collective mindset by prioritizing long-term sustainability of shared resources over individual short-term gains.
   - Encourage cooperation through forgiveness and rewarding consistent cooperation while still being prepared to respond to non-cooperative behavior.
   - Maintain adaptability by continually evaluating the effectiveness of the strategy based on recent payoffs, adjusting coop_threshold and coop_switch_len accordingly.

 In this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy called "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adjustment" (ATFT-SA). This strategy aims for long-term cooperation while remaining adaptive to various opponent behaviors and edge cases.

1. Decision rules:
   - Cooperate initially (first round) to establish trust and foster a cooperative environment
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponents' actions from the previous round
     - If all opponents cooperated, cooperate in the current round
     - If at least one opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round as punishment
     - Implement a forgiveness mechanism for minor deviations (defects) by allowing opponents to cooperate again after three consecutive defections
     - After forgiving an opponent, reset the defect counter to zero

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Adopt a generous strategy by cooperating, regardless of the opponents' previous actions
   - First round: Cooperate to build trust and encourage cooperation in the future
   - If stock level reaches zero due to overconsumption:
     - In the next round, adopt a more conservative approach by defecting to ensure survival while signaling disapproval of overconsumption
     - After surviving an episode of depleted stock, return to the cooperative Tit-for-Tat strategy

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource
   - Encourage cooperation among opponents for a mutually beneficial outcome
   - Adapt to opponent behavior while maintaining a cooperative spirit and promoting sustainable resource management

Pseudocode for ATFT-SA strategy:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round i, if the current stock level S is greater than or equal to 2n, cooperate (play C). This ensures that the common resource will not be depleted too quickly and allows it to grow.
   - If the current stock level S is less than 2n, play D (defect) only when at least half of the players played D in the previous round. The rationale behind this is to punish overconsumption while still preserving the resource for future rounds.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT-A(round, stock, history):
  if round == 1 or len(history) == 0:
    return C (Cooperate)
  else:
    num_defectors = count_defectors(history[-1])
    if num_defectors >= n/2 and stock < 2*n:
      return D (Defect)
    elif stock >= 2*n:
      return C (Cooperate)
    else:
      return history[-1][i] (copy previous player i's action)
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to conserve the resource and provide an opportunity for it to grow in subsequent rounds.
   - In the last round, play as per the decision rules, considering the current state of the game.

3. Be collective:
   - TFT-A aims to cooperate as much as possible while still punishing excessive consumption by a significant number of players. By doing so, it encourages long-term sustainability and fairness among all participants.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_372 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-Based Tit-for-Tat (AS-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, a player uses the current stock level and its own historical actions to determine whether to cooperate or defect.
   - If the current stock level is above a certain threshold (50% of the initial capacity), the player cooperates. This encourages conservation when resources are abundant.
   - If the current stock level falls below 25% of the initial capacity, the player defects to prevent further collapse of the common pool. This is a last resort to preserve resources for future rounds.
   - In all other cases, the player will mimic the action it took in the previous round (cooperate if it cooperated before and defect if it defected before), which represents tit-for-tat behavior.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Players cooperate, as the initial stock level is at capacity and no historical actions exist yet.
   - Last Round: Since players can't know they are in the last round, they will follow the general decision rules above. However, if the common pool collapses (stock = 0) by the end of the game, all players will defect to maximize their payoff in that final round.

3. Be Collective:
   - By following the described decision rules, AS-TFT promotes cooperation when resources are abundant and shifts towards defection as the common pool becomes depleted. This strategy is designed to foster sustainability while also being robust to various opponent behaviors.
   - The strategy encourages a collective mindset by cooperating when it believes other players will do the same, thus preserving the common pool for future rounds. When the common pool starts to collapse, AS-TFT shifts towards defection to incentivize other players to follow suit and conserve resources.

description_COLLECTIVE_373 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) with Stock Growth Consideration (SG-ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), setting a cooperative tone and fostering trust.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate past actions of both self and opponents to decide on current action.
     - If all players have been cooperating in the last 'c' rounds, cooperate (C). Adjust the value of 'c' dynamically based on the game state and history.
     - If any player has defected (D) in the last 'd' rounds, also defect (D). Adjust the value of 'd' dynamically based on the game state and history. The default values for c and d are set to a small integer, such as 1 or 2.
     - If neither condition is met, cooperate if the current stock level is above the average stock level over the past 'x' rounds, and defect otherwise. Adjust the value of 'x' dynamically based on the game state and history. The default value for x is set to a small integer, such as 3 or 4.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate even if opponents have defected in the past, since there are no further rounds to retaliate.
   - In case of a tie (i.e., all players have the same number of cooperation and defection), maintain the current strategy.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes collective interest by cooperating whenever possible, fostering an environment conducive to resource preservation and sustainable growth.
   - In cases where self-interest and collective interest conflict, the strategy leans towards cooperation, assuming that most players will also prioritize the common good. However, it will retaliate when necessary to protect the stock level from excessive depletion by defectors.

Pseudocode:

```python
def SG_ATFT(n, r, capacity, current_stock, history):
  strategy = {}
  c, d, x = default_values  # Define initial values for c, d, and x
  stock_average = get_average(history)

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Dynamics (ATFTSD)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate to build a foundation of trust. This sets the initial stock level at its maximum capacity.
     ```python
     if t == 1:
         action = 'C'
     ```

   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate whether to cooperate or defect based on past actions and current stock level. Mimic opponents' behavior when the stock is high (abundance) and collaborate more in low-stock situations (scarcity).
     ```python
     if t > 1:
         if stock_level < average_stock_level * 0.5 and last_round_action == 'D':
             action = 'C'  # Cooperate to preserve the common pool in times of scarcity
         elif stock_level > average_stock_level * 1.5 and last_round_action == 'C':
             action = 'D'   # Defect when opponents are overexploiting the resource (abundance)
         else:
             if random.uniform(0, 1) < 0.5:  # Randomly defect with a probability of 0.5 to introduce uncertainty in the strategy
                 action = 'D'
             else:
                 action = 'C'  # Cooperate by default when there is no clear signal to defect
     ```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): There is no need to retaliate or cooperate in the last round, as the game ends soon and the strategy will not interact with opponents again. Thus, behave randomly with a 50% chance of either cooperation or defection.
     ```python
     if t == r:
         action = random.choice(['C', 'D'])
     ```

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy focuses on maintaining the common pool as much as possible while being adaptive to opponents' behavior. This encourages cooperation when others do so, but also retaliates against overexploitation of resources. By doing so, it aims to align with a collective mindset that balances resource preservation and individual gain.

This ATFTSD strategy is adaptive and robust to various opponent behaviors by considering both the current stock level and recent actions taken by opponents. The random element introduced in the decision-making process adds an extra layer of uncertainty, making it harder for opponents to predict the AI's behavior.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, analyze opponent's behavior from previous rounds to determine cooperation or defection.
   - Initially cooperate (C), as the common resource is abundant and cooperation might lead to a higher growth rate in the future.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, also defect (D) to punish them for their selfish behavior. This action aims to enforce norms of cooperation in the long run.
   - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating (C).
   - In case of a mixed strategy with some cooperation and defection from opponents, choose to cooperate (C) to encourage others to follow suit and maintain a high stock level for future growth.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate (C), as there is no history to analyze.
   - Last Round: If the remaining stock allows for cooperation, choose C to help ensure a positive final payoff and potentially encourage cooperation in subsequent games. However, if defection is necessary due to low resources, then D.

3. Be Collective:
   - Strive to maintain a high common pool resource level by following the above rules to foster cooperation among players, considering their self-interest as well as the sustainability of the common resource.

Pseudocode:

```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    if round == 1 or len(history) < r:

description_COLLECTIVE_376 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative-Defensive (ACD) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the state of the game based on the current stock level and history of actions.
   - If the current stock is below a threshold T (determined by the capacity and number of players), defect to prevent rapid depletion of resources. Set T = 2n*min_threshold, where min_threshold is a fraction that prevents stock from falling below a critical level in the first few rounds.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to encourage resource conservation and promote long-term sustainability.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round (t=1), due to lack of history, set min_threshold as a predefined fraction (e.g., 0.5) and cooperate unless the current stock is below the calculated T.
   - As the game progresses, adjust min_threshold based on the average consumption rate observed in previous rounds. This helps the strategy adapt to opponent behaviours and respond appropriately in future rounds.
   - In the last round (t=r), cooperate if the current stock is above a survival threshold S (determined by capacity and number of players), otherwise defect to maximize individual payoff. Set S = 2n*max_survival_threshold, where max_survival_threshold is a fraction that ensures adequate resources for all players in the final round.

3. Being Collective:
   - Prioritize long-term resource conservation over short-term gains to promote sustainable use of common pool resources.
   - Cooperate when appropriate to encourage collective growth and maintain a stable stock level.
   - Defect strategically when necessary to protect the common pool from depletion, ensuring its continued availability for future rounds.

description_COLLECTIVE_377 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to allow room for possible cooperation in future rounds. (Cooperate(1) = True)
   - Subsequent rounds:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back. (Cooperate(t) = OpponentCooperation(t-1))
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect to punish the defection and encourage cooperation in future rounds. (Cooperate(t) = Not(OpponentCooperation(t-1)))
   - For the last round, cooperate to show a willingness for continued cooperation in future games. (Cooperate(r) = True)

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, there is no previous history so you can only base your decision on the current state of the game (n, r, capacity, stock). Since cooperation promotes a better collective outcome, cooperate in the first round.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy encourages long-term cooperation by adapting to the opponent's actions but maintaining a commitment to reciprocity. This allows for a collective approach by promoting mutual understanding and incentivizing shared benefits in the game.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATfT(t, opponent_cooperation, stock, capacity, n, r):

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (in the first round), cooperate to build trust and goodwill among opponents.
   - In subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's action from the previous round: If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect in response. This is known as "Tit-for-Tat" strategy.
   - To account for potential free-riding or exploitation by opponents, introduce a punishment mechanism: if an opponent continuously defeats (defects) for three consecutive rounds, switch to defecting until the opponent starts cooperating again. This ensures fairness and long-term cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(round, own_action, opponent_history):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C' (Cooperate)

  previous_opponent_action = opponent_history[len(opponent_history)-1]

  if len(opponent_history) > 3 and previous_opponent_action == 'D' for last 3 rounds:
    return 'D' (Defect)

  elif previous_opponent_action == 'C':
    return 'C' (Cooperate)
  else:
    return 'D' (Defect)
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a positive starting point and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - In the last round, prioritize maintaining the common pool resource to ensure its survival for future rounds or games. If necessary, cooperate even if an opponent has defected in previous rounds.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy is inherently collective and promotes fairness, cooperation, and mutual understanding among players. By mirroring opponents' actions, it encourages reciprocity and long-term collaboration while also protecting against exploitation.
   - This strategy emphasizes maintaining a sustainable common pool resource for the benefit of all players in the long term, fostering a collective mindset by balancing immediate self-interest with future cooperation opportunities.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Start by cooperating (C), establishing a friendly initial gesture. `if t == 1 then action = 'C'`
   - Subsequent Rounds (t > 1): In each round, observe the opponent's action from the previous round and respond accordingly:
     - If opponent cooperated (C) in the last round, cooperate as well to maintain harmony. `if last_opponent_action == 'C' then action = 'C'`
     - If opponent defected (D) in the last round, defect this round to punish the defection. `if last_opponent_action == 'D' then action = 'D'`
   - This tit-for-tat approach encourages cooperation when it is reciprocated and punishes defections with a single round of punishment, allowing for the potential reestablishment of cooperation in subsequent rounds.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Since the goal is to maximize total payoff over all rounds, defect on the last round as there will be no future interactions with this opponent. `if t == r then action = 'D'`
   - First Round (t=1): As mentioned earlier, start by cooperating. `if t == 1 then action = 'C'`

3. Be Collective:
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy promotes a collective mindset as it encourages cooperation when others do the same and retaliates only when necessary to punish defections, fostering an environment where mutual cooperation can thrive over time. This approach aligns well with the concept of collective strategies in a multi-player setting like this game.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate on the first round to show goodwill and foster cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, defect. This encourages reciprocal behavior and punishes betrayal.
   - If the opponent has consistently cooperated for a certain number of rounds (patience), start cooperating again even if they defected in the most recent round to give them another chance to cooperate.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperation is not necessary since the game ends soon. However, cooperating might still be beneficial depending on the opponent's behavior in previous rounds.
   - In the first round, cooperate as previously mentioned.
   - If the opponent doesn't cooperate at all (defects every time), consider defecting after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts to establish cooperation (punishment period). Afterward, revert to the TFT-AC strategy.

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain an adaptability mindset that balances self-interest with collective well-being by responding to the opponent's actions in a way that encourages ongoing cooperation while also preserving resources for future rounds.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_AC(n, r, capacity, stock, round, history):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to foster cooperation
  else:
    if (len(history) <= patience) and (history[-1] == 'D'):
      action = 'D'  # Punishment period for defection
    elif history[-1] == 'C':
      action = 'C'  # Cooperate when the opponent cooperated in the previous round
    else:
      action = '?'  # Uncertainty about opponent's next move

  if round == r or len(history) >= patience + punishment_period:
    if history[-1] == 'D':
      action = 'D'  # End the game or punish the opponent after the punishment period
    else:
      action = 'C'  # Cooperate with the opponent who has shown cooperative behavior recently

  return action
```

In this pseudocode, `patience` is the number of rounds to wait for an opponent's cooperation before starting to punish them, and `punishment_period` is the duration of the punishment phase. These values can be adjusted based on the specific game conditions and desired strategy adaptability.

     - In all other cases, consider the average historical stock depletion rate to decide whether to cooperate or defect. If the current depletion rate is close to the sustainable consumption rate, cooperate; otherwise defect.
       Pseudocode: if (stock >= T) and (abs(stock_depletion_rate - sustainable_consumption_rate) < threshold) then action = 'C' else action = 'D'

2. Handle Edge Cases
   - Last Round (t=r): Cooperate to maximize payoff in the final round, regardless of stock level.
     Pseudocode: if t == r then action = 'C'

3. Be Collective
   - Maintain a moving average of historical stock depletion rates over several rounds (M) for adaptive decision making.
     Pseudocode: For each round t, calculate the moving average as follows:
       - Initialize an empty list for storing historical stock depletion rates.
       - Add the current stock depletion rate to the list if there are M or fewer elements in it already.
       - Remove the oldest stock depletion rate from the list if there are more than M elements in it.
       - Calculate the moving average as the mean of the elements in the list.
   - Set the sustainable consumption rate (sustainable_consumption_rate) and threshold (threshold) based on empirical data and simulations, ensuring long-term sustainability while promoting cooperation among players.

This Titan Strategy aims to balance resource exploitation with conservation, fostering a collective mindset that prioritizes the long-term viability of the common pool resource. It is adaptive, robust, and aligned with the game's parameters, state, and history.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_382 = '''
 For the Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy named "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)". The ATFT strategy is inspired by the Tit-for-Tat strategy in game theory, but adapted to work in this dynamic and multiplayer environment.

1. Decision rules:
   - Initially cooperate (C) in the first round to show goodwill.
   - In subsequent rounds, imitate opponents' actions from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated, return the cooperation; if they defected, also defect. This encourages cooperation but also punishes defection.
   - If a player encounters a situation where they are the only one cooperating (and thus being exploited), they should switch to defecting after a predetermined patience time or number of rounds. This prevents excessive altruism and ensures some degree of self-interest.
   - To promote cooperation, players can also consider the stock level as an indicator of the overall resource health. If the stock is below a certain threshold (e.g., capacity/2), players should cooperate to help restore the resource. Once the stock exceeds the threshold or the patience time has passed, they may return to imitating opponents' actions.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there will be no subsequent rounds for retaliation, players should always cooperate regardless of their opponents' actions in the previous round. This encourages cooperation in the final stage of the game.
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, players should cooperate to show goodwill and encourage cooperation from others.
   - When encountering edge cases such as a player joining the game late or being disconnected during play, other players can remember their actions from the time they were present and continue applying the ATFT strategy accordingly.

3. Be collective:
   - Players should prioritize the overall well-being of the common pool resource to ensure its sustainability for future rounds.
   - Players should work together to achieve a balance between cooperation and self-interest, taking into account both their individual payoffs and the long-term health of the common resource.

Pseudocode representation:

```python
def AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    patience_time = int(r * 0.9)  # 90% of rounds as patience time
    threshold = int(capacity / 2)

    def get_opponents_actions(history):
        return [action for round in history if action != 'player_index']

    def decide_action(history, patience_time, threshold):
        opponents_actions = get_opponents_actions(history)
        if len(history) == 1:  # first round
            return 'C'
        elif len(history) == r:  # last round
            return 'C'
        else:
            current_round = len(history) - 1
            opponent_last_action = opponents_actions[-1]
            if stock < threshold and current_round > patience_time:
                return 'C'
            elif opponent_last_action == 'C':
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

    history.append(stock / (2 * n))  # record current stock level as action
    return decide_action(history, patience_time, threshold)

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This serves as an initial gesture of cooperation and goodwill.
   - For subsequent rounds, follow the strategy of the opponent from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if the opponent defected, also defect. This encourages reciprocity and fosters a stable long-term relationship.
   - If the stock drops below (n/2) during any round, switch to exclusively defecting for the remainder of the game to ensure survival and prevent further depletion.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if the opponent has been consistently cooperative, as a final gesture of goodwill. If the opponent has been primarily defective, it is best to defect to maximize individual payoff.
   - In the first round, if the stock level is (n/2) or less, switch to exclusively defecting for the remainder of the game due to the scarcity of resources.

3. Alignment with Collective Mindset:
   - Prioritizes collective well-being by initially cooperating and reciprocating the opponent's actions.
   - Encourages sustainable resource consumption by avoiding depletion when resources become scarce (stock < n/2).
   - Fosters stability and cooperation through its Tit-for-Tat nature, allowing for coordination with other strategies that follow similar decision rules.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATFT(n, r, stock, capacity, history):
  strategy = {"C": 0, "D": 0} # Initialize strategy counts

  if round == 1: # First round
    action = "C" if stock >= n/2 else "D"

  elif round == r: # Last round
    action = "C" if opponent_history[-1] == "C" else "D"

  else:
    last_opponent_action = opponent_history[-1]

    if stock < n/2: # Resource scarcity
      action = "D"
    elif last_opponent_action == "C":
      action = "C"
    else:
      action = "D"

  strategy[action] += 1 # Update strategy counts for this round

  return action # Return chosen action
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C). This establishes a cooperative starting point and avoids punishing potential cooperators unnecessarily.
   - For subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate in the current round (C). This reinforces cooperation and encourages trust.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, also defect in the current round (D). This punishes defection to maintain a balanced stock level.
   - The strategy is flexible enough to adapt to various opponent behaviors, such as always cooperating or always defecting, while still promoting cooperation when possible.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, consider the current stock and the total game payoff gained so far. If the current stock is close to depletion (e.g., below 50% of capacity), always cooperate (C). This allows for a chance at a higher payoff in case there are remaining resources. Conversely, if the current stock is high (e.g., above 80% of capacity), always defect (D) to secure a larger share of the resources for the final round.
   - In the first round, since no previous actions exist, the strategy falls back to always cooperating (C).

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy prioritizes long-term cooperation and mutual benefit by punishing defection while encouraging cooperation through reciprocity. This collective mindset aims to build a sustainable common pool resource for all players over multiple rounds.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATFT(opponent_action, round, stock, capacity, n, r):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    if opponent_action == 'C':  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated in the previous round
        return 'C'
    else:  # Defect if opponent defected in the previous round
        return 'D'

def handle_edge_cases(stock, capacity, n, r, round):
    if round == r:  # Last round
        if stock < (capacity / 2):  # Low stock, cooperate to preserve resources
            return 'C'
        elif stock > (3 * capacity / 4):  # High stock, defect to secure a larger share
            return 'D'
    return None  # No edge case applies for other rounds, continue with ATFT strategy

def play_game(opponent_strategy, game_params):
    stock = game_params['capacity']

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Awareness (ATFS)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate to start with a positive relationship and set the initial stock level higher. (ATFS_Cooperate(t=1))
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), cooperate back as a gesture of trust, rewarding cooperation while preserving the common pool resource. (ATFS_Cooperate(t) if ATFS_OpponentCooperation(t-1))
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round (t-1), defect to penalize defection and protect the common pool. (ATFS_Defect(t) if !ATFS_OpponentCooperation(t-1))
   - If the current stock level is below a certain threshold (T) that threatens the sustainability of the resource, prioritize conservation by always cooperating regardless of past actions. (ATFS_Conserve(t) if StockLevel(t) < T)

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (r), ATFS follows the same decision rules but with an emphasis on maximizing payoffs based on accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds:
     a. If accumulated stock depletion is below average (AverageDepletion(t=1,...,r-1)), cooperate to help recover the common pool. (ATFS_Cooperate(r) if StockDepletion(1,...,r-1) < AverageDepletion(1,...,r-1))
     b. If accumulated stock depletion is above average, defect to penalize excessive depletion and encourage future cooperation. (ATFS_Defect(r) if StockDepletion(1,...,r-1) > AverageDepletion(1,...,r-1))
     c. If accumulated stock depletion is close to the average, cooperate or defect based on past actions of opponents: reward cooperation and penalize defection. (ATFS_Cooperate(r) if ATFS_OpponentCooperation(r-1) && StockDepletion(1,...,r-1) ≈ AverageDepletion(1,...,r-1))

3. Be Collective:
   - Prioritize the common good by avoiding excessive stock depletion and promoting cooperation when possible.
   - Respond to opponents' actions in a reciprocal manner while considering the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode for ATFS strategy:

```python

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This initiates cooperation and demonstrates goodwill.
   - For subsequent rounds, follow the actions of the opponent in the previous round. If the opponent cooperated (C), also cooperate. If the opponent defected (D), defect in response. This rule encourages cooperation when it is reciprocated but punishes defection with a similar action to maintain fairness and promote long-term collaboration.
   - In case of multiple opponents, apply the rule individually for each opponent.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Follow the decision rule based on the previous round's actions, as in normal game rounds.
   - Initial stock depletion (stock = 0): Cooperate in the first round to potentially contribute to stock recovery and encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds. For following rounds, respond according to the opponent's action in the previous round.
   - Stock exceeding capacity: Ignore the growth phase when calculating the new stock if it would result in a value greater than the capacity. In such cases, set the new stock equal to the capacity to maintain the sustainability of the common pool resource.

3. Be collective:

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Quotient (TFT-AQ) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, players will always cooperate to initiate potential trust and collaboration. (Cooperate(1)=True)
   - For subsequent rounds, calculate an Adaptive Cooperative Quotient (ACQ) based on previous actions of opponents and apply it to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
   - ACQ is a value between 0 and 1 that represents the opponent's average level of cooperation in the last c previous rounds: ACQ = (Σ(t=r-c+1 to r) cooperative_opponent_t) / c
   - If ACQ > t (threshold, 0 < t < 1), players will cooperate. Otherwise, they will defect. (Cooperate(t)=ACQ > t)

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Players don't need to consider future rounds and can use their current ACQ to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
   - Initial stock depletion: If the initial stock is below 2n, the first players will adjust their threshold accordingly so as not to deplete it completely in one round (Cooperate(1)=min(initial_stock/(2*n),1)).

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:
   - Players prioritize maintaining the common pool resource and sustaining long-term collaboration over immediate individual gains, as indicated by their threshold value (t).
   - The TFT-AQ strategy promotes cooperation but also punishes non-cooperative behavior to ensure that other players respect the collective mindset.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFT_AQ(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, c, t):
    def Cooperate(t):
        if t == 1:
            return min(initial_stock/(2*n), 1)
        ACQ = sum([cooperative_opponent_i for i in range(r-c+1, r)]) / c
        return ACQ > t

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules (Cooperate vs Defect):
   - In the first round, cooperate to start with a positive relationship and share resources fairly.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's strategy from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect as well. This encourages reciprocal behavior but is not overly punitive.
   - When the stock reaches zero (or near depletion), switch to a more conservative strategy and start cooperating even if the opponent defected in the previous round to avoid further depleting the resource.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize the maximum possible payoff by cooperating regardless of the opponent's previous action, as the game ends after this round.
   - In the first round, start cooperating and set a flag to remember the opponent's action for the next round.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy focuses on promoting cooperation among players to maintain the common pool resource in a sustainable manner. By reciprocating the opponent's actions, ATFT encourages long-term cooperation while also being robust against defector opponents.

Pseudocode for Adaptive Tit-for-Tat:
```python
def atft(n, r, capacity, stock, round_number):

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This is a gesture of goodwill and demonstrates the intent to collaborate.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's actions in the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect.
   - If an opponent has been consistently cooperative (n consecutive cooperations), continue cooperating for a grace period of n rounds. This encourages long-term collaboration.
   - If an opponent has recently defected or shows signs of being uncooperative, revert to defecting to punish the uncooperative behaviour and encourage cooperation in the future.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if the current stock level is above a predefined threshold (e.g., capacity/2) to maximize payoff; otherwise defect since there won't be another chance for collaboration.
   - In the first round, cooperate as previously stated.
   - If the opponent has been consistently uncooperative (no cooperation for a specified number of rounds), switch to defecting indefinitely, acknowledging that continued collaboration with such an opponent is unlikely to yield positive results.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - This strategy aims to balance immediate and long-term payoffs while promoting cooperation with opponents who demonstrate collaborative behaviour. It encourages a collective mindset by rewarding reciprocal actions and fostering trust through the grace period.

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the initial round, players start by cooperating to allow the stock to grow and ensure a higher payoff in subsequent rounds (Cooperate).
   - For subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, players continue cooperating as a sign of trust and reciprocity (If PreviousRoundAction == Cooperate, then Cooperate).
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, players retaliate by defecting to punish the opponent for depleting the stock and encourage cooperation in the future (If PreviousRoundAction == Defect, then Defect).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, all players cooperate to establish a baseline (Cooperate).
   - In the last round, players should consider their current stock level and remaining rounds' payoffs. If the stock is near depletion, players should defect to gain as much as possible from the remaining resources, while if the stock is abundant, continuing cooperation might lead to a higher total payoff (Analyze Current Stock Level & Remaining Rounds, then either Cooperate or Defect).

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Players should aim for a sustainable stock level that benefits all players in the long run while being responsive to opponents' actions and encouraging cooperation.
   - In each round, players share their decisions (Cooperate or Defect) with other players to promote transparency and reinforce the collective norm of reciprocity. This information exchange allows players to learn from each other and adapt their strategies accordingly.

   - If the average stock level is above a threshold (50% of capacity), the agent cooperates (C). This encourages conservation and long-term sustainability.
   - If the average stock level is below the threshold, the agent defects (D) in order to protect itself from collapsing stocks.
   - The agent keeps track of its own history (cooperate or defect) as well as the opponent's history in the previous four rounds.
   - If the agent and the opponent have both been cooperating for at least three consecutive rounds, the agent will continue to cooperate even if the average stock level is below the threshold. This rewards cooperation and fosters trust among players.
   - If the agent has recently defected or the opponent has recently defected, the agent will also defect, enforcing a punishment phase to discourage defection.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, the strategy starts by cooperating (C). This initial cooperation sets a positive tone and offers an opportunity for mutual benefit if other agents follow suit.
   - In the last round, the strategy follows the current decision rules based on the average stock level and recent history, as described above.
   - In case of ties (e.g., three players have cooperated and one has defected), the agent will continue its previous action if it has been cooperating; otherwise, it will defect to enforce punishment.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATFT-SC strategy emphasizes cooperation when possible but prioritizes sustainable resource management. By considering the average stock level and recent history, the strategy promotes a balance between individual and collective interests while being adaptable to various opponent behaviors.
   - The use of a simple memory mechanism ensures that the strategy can learn from past experiences and adjust its actions accordingly, fostering a more collaborative approach over time.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) with Stock-Based Forgiveness

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), to establish a cooperative initial environment.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate whether to cooperate or defect based on the average past actions of all opponents and the current stock level.
   - If the average past action of opponents is cooperative (i.e., their average payoff from previous rounds is close to S/(2n)) and the current stock level is above a certain threshold (T), then cooperate (C). Otherwise, defect (D).
   - To determine the threshold T, we can consider a range between S_min = 2n and S_max = capacity. Adjust T as a function of the current stock level, such that T increases linearly from S_min to S_max as the stock level increases from 0 to capacity.
   - Forgiveness is incorporated by forgiving opponents if their past actions improve, even if the current stock level is below the threshold T. The forgiveness factor can be controlled by adjusting a forgetting parameter (α) that determines how much importance we give to recent past actions over older ones.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, defect (D), as there are no future rounds for retaliation or cooperation.
   - If the stock level is 0 in any round, defect (D) to prevent the game from being stuck at a zero state.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - This strategy encourages a cooperative approach by assuming that opponents will also follow a cooperative strategy when they see cooperation from ATFT.
   - The adaptability of ATFT allows it to adjust its behavior based on the strategies of other players, promoting more cooperative outcomes when other players are also cooperating.
   - The stock-based forgiveness feature helps maintain some level of cooperation even when opponents deviate and encourages them to revert to a cooperative strategy if they improve their actions.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative initial tone and allows for stock growth.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's behavior from previous rounds and respond accordingly:
     - If the opponent has cooperated in the past, cooperate. Mimic the opponent's cooperation to encourage continued mutual benefit.
     - If the opponent has defected in the past, also defect. This serves as a deterrent against further exploitation and promotes reciprocity.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions to maximize payoff for that specific round.
   - If the stock level reaches zero, restart with cooperating in the next round since there is no stock left to consume anyway, and it encourages future cooperation.

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize collective growth by starting cooperatively.
   - Adapt to opponent's behavior to promote a balanced distribution of resources among players.
   - Maintain long-term sustainability by considering the potential for stock depletion and growth in decision-making.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFT_strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C' # Cooperate in the first round

  else:
    opponent_behavior = analyze_history(history) # Analyze opponent's behavior from previous rounds
    if opponent_behavior == 'cooperate':
      action = 'C' # If opponent cooperated, cooperate as well
    elif opponent_behavior == 'defect':
      action = 'D' # If opponent defected, defect to deter further exploitation

  consume_stock = determine_consumption(action) # Determine the stock consumption based on the chosen action
  update_state(stock, consume_stock) # Update the current state of the game
  return action
```

description_COLLECTIVE_396 = '''
 For this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy called "Adaptive Stock-based Cooperation" (ASC). The ASC strategy aims to balance resource consumption and growth for long-term sustainability while being adaptive and robust against various opponent behaviors.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock level is above the "Cooperative Threshold" (CT), which is set as a percentage of the maximum sustainable stock level (capacity).
   - Defect (D) when the current stock level is below or equal to the CT.
   - The initial CT value can be set relatively high, like 80%, to encourage cooperation in the first round. As the game progresses and the stock depletes, the CT decreases incrementally until a minimum threshold of 20%. This way, as resources become scarcer, ASC becomes more likely to defect.
   - CT = (minimum threshold + (maximum threshold - minimum threshold) * (1 - ((r - round_number) / r))) * (capacity / n)

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate with a higher CT value to encourage cooperation among players.
   - In the last round, prioritize defection since there will be no growth in the next round.

3. Be collective:
   - The ASC strategy prioritizes long-term resource sustainability while being adaptive to various opponent behaviors and game conditions. By considering the current stock level and the number of rounds remaining, it aligns with a collective mindset that seeks to balance consumption and growth for the benefit of all players in the long run.

Pseudocode:
```
function Adaptive_Stock_based_Cooperation(round_number, r, n, capacity, current_stock):
    CT = (minimum_threshold + (maximum_threshold - minimum_threshold) * (1 - ((r - round_number) / r))) * (capacity / n)
    if current_stock > CT:
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'
```
In the given pseudocode, `round_number`, `r`, `n`, `capacity`, and `current_stock` are the game parameters; `minimum_threshold` (20%) and `maximum_threshold` (80%) are constant values that determine when to cooperate or defect. The CT variable is calculated based on the current round number, total rounds, and maximum sustainable stock level.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to start with a positive relationship and maintain a high initial stock level.
   - After the first round, monitor opponents' actions (cooperation or defection) and respond accordingly. If an opponent cooperates, also cooperate; if they defect, defect in the next round as a punishment. Once cooperation is resumed, stick to cooperating. This Tit-for-Tat behavior helps maintain a stable relationship with other players while promoting cooperation when possible.
   - To account for the changing stock level and capacity constraints, TFT-SA adjusts the level of cooperation based on the current stock level and optimal sustainable stock. If the stock is above 50% of the maximum sustainable stock (50% * capacity / n), cooperate; otherwise defect to prevent overconsumption.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, as the stock is no longer affected by actions, TFT-SA will always cooperate to maximize individual payoff.
   - If the stock drops to zero due to overconsumption, the strategy starts afresh in the next round by cooperating and attempting to rebuild the common pool resource.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - By adhering to the Tit-for-Tat principle, TFT-SA promotes a balance between cooperation and defection while maintaining a collective interest in sustaining the common pool resource for future rounds.
   - The strategy's adjustments based on the current stock level ensure that it aligns with the long-term sustainability of the game while being flexible enough to adapt to a wide range of opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFT_SA(round, stock, capacity, n):
  if round == 1:
    return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

  if (stock / (capacity / n)) > 0.5:
    return "C"  # Cooperate if the current stock is above 50% of the maximum sustainable stock
  else:
    return "D"  # Defect to prevent overconsumption

def last_round(round):
  return round == r  # Check if it's the last round

def zero_stock(stock):

def stock_empty(stock, capacity, n):

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-Based Tit-for-Tat (ASB-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the stock level is above a threshold 'T' and the number of previous rounds where we cooperated and opponents also cooperated is greater than or equal to 'M'.
   - Defect (D) in all other cases, including when the stock level is below T or when cooperation conditions are not met.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as there's no previous information about opponents' behavior.
   - In the last round, cooperate if the current stock level is above 'T' and a sufficient number of previous rounds were cooperative; otherwise defect.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a running tally of our past actions (C or D) and opponents' responses for each opponent (CC, CD, DC, DD). If the current state matches one of these patterns, take the corresponding action to foster long-term cooperation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (with slight modifications for resource conservation)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (round 1), cooperate to demonstrate trust and build a cooperative environment.
   - In subsequent rounds, imitate the opponent's actions from the previous round. This encourages cooperation and punishes defection. If the opponent defected in the last round, also defect in the current round as punishment; if the opponent cooperated, also cooperate to maintain cooperation.
   - To conserve resources, adjust the level of resource consumption based on the remaining capacity and number of players:
     - If stock < (capacity / n), always choose C (Cooperate) to avoid depleting the stock entirely.
     - If stock >= (capacity / n), use a probability P for choosing D (Defect) that depends on the stock level: P = max(0, min((stock - capacity/n)/(capacity - capacity/n), 1)).
       This means the higher the stock and the closer it is to the maximum sustainable stock level, the higher the likelihood of defecting.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (r), since there are no future rounds for retaliation or cooperation, always cooperate to maximize payoff.
   - If stock becomes zero at any point, the strategy will switch to always choosing C (Cooperate) until the stock reaches a level above (capacity / n).

3. Collective Mindset:
   - By imitating opponents' actions and adapting resource consumption based on remaining capacity, the strategy encourages cooperation while also conserving resources for long-term success.

Pseudocode:

```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This is a gesture of goodwill and sets a collaborative tone for the game.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round: if opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This strategy encourages cooperation when met with cooperation but also retaliates against defection to maintain a balance and prevent excessive exploitation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, as the game ends regardless of actions taken, cooperate (C) to maximize individual payoff assuming the opponent will also cooperate due to the reciprocal nature of the strategy.
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) as mentioned above.
   - If the opponent deviates from cooperation for multiple rounds consecutively or defects in the last few rounds, consider adapting by adopting a more aggressive approach and defecting when the opponent defects to punish such behaviour and discourage further exploitation.

3. Aligning with the Collective Mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy aims to promote cooperation within the group by encouraging reciprocal behaviour, setting a norm of mutual trust, and penalizing defection through retaliation.
   - By adapting to the opponent's behaviour, the strategy demonstrates an understanding of the need for collective action and self-regulation in the pursuit of shared prosperity within the group.

Pseudocode:
```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(round, opponent_action_history) {
  if (round == 1) return 'C'; // Cooperate in the first round
  if (round == r) return 'C'; // Cooperate in the last round

  if (opponent_action_history[round-1] == 'C') return 'C'; // If opponent cooperated, cooperate
  else return 'D'; // Else defect
}
```

Note: The strategy may be further enhanced by incorporating features such as forgetting old history entries after a certain number of rounds, adapting the rate of forgetting or punishment based on observed opponent behaviour, and experimenting with different strategies for punishing deviations.

3. Collective mindset:

   - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (if previous_action == D, then action = D). This retaliates to the defection while still allowing for recovery.
   - To encourage long-term cooperation, adopt a forgiving approach by returning to cooperation after two consecutive defections (if count_defects >= 2, set count_defects = 0 and action = C).
   - Implement a stock-growth sensitivity: if the current stock is below a threshold T (T defined as capacity/n), defect in the current round to prevent starvation (if stock < T, then action = D).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of opponent's previous actions to maximize final payoff (r == r, then action = C).
   - If the game is not the first round but the player has no previous information about the opponent (history empty), cooperate in the initial action (len(history) == 0, then action = C).

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initial Round: Play Cooperate (C) to foster a cooperative environment and build trust.
   - Subsequent Rounds: If the opponent played C in the previous round, respond with C. If they played D, retaliate with D in the current round. This creates a "shadow of the future" where defecting repeatedly may lead to long-term punishment.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First Round: Cooperate as mentioned earlier.
   - Last Round and Low Stock (Stock < 10n): Play Defect since the remaining resource may not recover and it's important to have resources for future rounds if the game continues.
   - Full Stock (Stock = capacity): In this case, play Cooperate as it is beneficial for all players when the common pool is full.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Collaborative Behavior: By playing Cooperate in the initial round and matching the opponent's actions thereafter, TfTA encourages cooperation among players to maintain a healthy stock level.

     a) If the opponent cooperated (C), reciprocate by cooperating (C).
     b) If the opponent defected (D), defect in the same round (D). However, starting from the next round, gradually shift towards cooperation as follows:
        i. Increase cooperation probability (p) by a small constant factor (e.g., 0.01) after every round of mutual cooperation.
        ii. Decrease cooperation probability (p) by a smaller constant factor (e.g., 0.005) after each round of defection, but only if the opponent has not cooperated in the last three rounds. This helps avoid being taken advantage of by overly aggressive opponents.
     c) If the opponent's behavior is unpredictable or mixed (both C and D in the last 3 rounds), mimic their most recent action with a small probability bias towards cooperation (e.g., 0.6).

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate since it might help boost the final stock level for all players (C).
   - If the opponent defects in the last three rounds and the current round is not the last one, switch to a more aggressive strategy to penalize the opponent (e.g., always defect until the end of the game).

 Title: Fitness-driven Adaptive Strategy (FAS) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, each player i evaluates its current action based on three factors: individual fitness, collective fitness, and historical trends.

     a. Individual Fitness (IF): The difference between the average payoff in the past few rounds and the minimum payoff received so far. A higher IF indicates a better personal performance.

     b. Collective Fitness (CF): An aggregate measure of all players' IF, emphasizing cooperation when the group is doing well and defecting to prevent further depletion of resources when the group is struggling.

     c. Historical Trends (HT): A comparison of the current stock level with historical averages to predict future resource availability and adjust actions accordingly.

   - If IF > CF and HT indicates a growing trend, player i chooses C to contribute to the common pool and enhance individual fitness.
   - If IF < CF or HT suggests depleting resources, player i chooses D to maximize immediate payoff without consideration of long-term collective wellbeing.
   - In case of equal weights for IF, CF, and HT (which can be adjusted as a parameter), the action with the highest probability of leading to a higher stock growth is chosen.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Players should choose an action based on historical trends since no past data exists; they can use a random selection or make an initial assumption about resource levels.
   - Last Round: Since the game ends after r rounds, players will prioritize maximizing their total payoff over the entire game. Thus, they might deviate from their decision rule in the last round to exploit residual resources if necessary.

3. Be Collective:
   - Players prioritize collective fitness over individual fitness to preserve common resources for future rounds, assuming ongoing cooperation can lead to higher long-term payoffs.
   - Players adjust their actions based on historical trends to maintain a balanced stock level and promote sustainable use of resources.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-based Tit-for-Tat (ASTFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate when the current stock level is above a threshold (T_C). This encourages cooperation in more abundant resource scenarios, promoting mutual benefit and sustainable resource management.
     Pseudocode: if (stock > T_C) then cooperate else defect

   - Defect when the current stock level is below another threshold (T_D), ensuring survival during critical resource scarcity.
     Pseudocode: if (stock < T_D) then defect else cooperate

   - Adaptive Punishment: In response to a defector, ASTFT will also defect in the following round(s). This serves as punishment for those who deplete resources excessively and aims to discourage selfish behavior. To balance cooperation and punishment, ASTFT remembers the number of consecutive defections from each opponent (D_consecutive).
     Pseudocode: if (opponent defected last round) then increment D_consecutive for that opponent else reset it to zero

   - Forgiving Nature: After a certain number of rounds without any defection from an opponent (F_consecutive), ASTFT forgives and resets its memory, encouraging the rebuilding of trust and cooperation.
     Pseudocode: if (opponent has not defected for F_consecutive rounds) then reset D_consecutive to zero

   - Tit-for-Tat Cooperative Rebound: If ASTFT defects due to resource scarcity or opponent's defection, it will return to cooperation once the stock level recovers above T_C. This promotes resilience and flexibility in the strategy.
     Pseudocode: if (stock > T_C) then cooperate, regardless of D_consecutive for any opponent

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate since no history or information about opponents is available yet.
   - Last Round: ASTFT will make a decision based on the current stock level and D_consecutive for each opponent, using the same rules as normal rounds.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Resource Preservation: By promoting cooperation and resource conservation, ASTFT encourages collective sustainability and mutual benefit among players.
   - Flexibility: ASTFT adapts its behavior based on current stock levels, opponent's actions, and the history of the game, making it resilient to various opponent strategies.

 In this Common Pool Resource Game, we'll develop a robust adaptive strategy called "Fitness-Driven Tit-for-Tat (FD-TFT)". The aim is to balance cooperation and defection based on past experiences with other players while maintaining a collective mindset.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Start by cooperating to build up the common pool resource as much as possible.
   - Subsequent Rounds (2 ≤ t ≤ r):
     - If all players cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating as it's beneficial for everyone.
     - If any player defected in the previous round, defect this round to punish the defector and encourage cooperation.
     - If the current stock is less than a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), regardless of past actions, always cooperate to prevent further depletion of the resource.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Since the game ends in this round, it's important to ensure a good outcome for all players, so cooperate no matter what happened in the previous rounds or the current state of the common pool.

3. Be collective:
   - Cooperate as much as possible to preserve the resource for future generations while encouraging others to do the same through punishment when needed.
   - Adapt to the opponent's behavior by switching between cooperation and defection based on their previous actions, but always prioritize building up the common pool in the initial rounds.

        action = C

    else: # Subsequent rounds
        if stock < threshold or (t == r): # If resource is low or game ends
            action = C

            action = D

    memory[t%n].append(action)
    return action
```

This Fitness-Driven Tit-for-Tat strategy balances cooperation and defection based on the current state of the common pool, past actions of opponents, and the game's progression. It promotes a collective mindset while being adaptive to various opponent behaviors in this repeated resource game.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This is a gesture of goodwill and demonstrates trust to others.
   - For subsequent rounds, mirror the opponents' actions from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if they defected, defect. This rule encourages reciprocity while maintaining a forgiving nature for occasional defections.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Since payoffs are accumulated over all rounds, there is no special treatment required for the last round as it will contribute to the total payoff.
   - First Round: As mentioned above, cooperate in the first round to initiate a cooperative environment.
   - Special Situations (e.g., when stock depletes): Adaptive Tit-for-Tat continues to mirror opponents' actions regardless of whether the stock level changes or not. However, when the common pool resource is close to depletion (e.g., when the stock falls below 50% of capacity), it may be beneficial for all strategies to adjust their behavior and prioritize conservation.

3. Being Collective:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy emphasizes collective thinking by promoting reciprocity and forgiveness, encouraging cooperative behaviors that benefit the group as a whole. By mirroring opponents' actions, the strategy ensures that it aligns with others' decisions, fostering a sense of collective mindset.
   - It is essential to note that ATFT does not rely on shared norms or coordination mechanisms; rather, it operates based on individual decisions influenced by past experiences in interactions with other players.

Pseudocode:

```python
function AdaptiveTitForTat(player_index, opponents_actions_history, stock, n, capacity):
  if round_number == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

  if opponent_from_last_round_cooperated:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
  else:
    return 'D'  # Defect if opponent defected last round
```

description_COLLECTIVE_409 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Conservation Strategy (ASC)

1. Decision Rules:
   ASC aims at sustaining a balanced resource level by promoting cooperation initially and adapting to opponent behaviors throughout the game. The decision rules are as follows:

   - In the first round, all players cooperate to build up stock and establish trust among participants.
   - When the stock is below 2n (i.e., the minimum sustainable level for all players), all players choose to cooperate to rebuild the resource base.
   - If the stock is between 2n and capacity/2, players randomly decide whether to cooperate or defect to maintain a balanced resource level.
   - When the stock exceeds capacity/2, it's advantageous for players to defect to deplete the excess resources, but they still consider the potential benefits of cooperation based on historical payoffs. ASC uses an adaptive mechanism that increases the probability of cooperation as players observe mutual cooperation in previous rounds.
   - In the last round, players will prioritize maximizing their individual payoff by exploiting the remaining resources, regardless of whether it depletes the stock to zero or not.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - ASC handles the edge case of the first round as described earlier.
   - In the last round, all players defect due to the priority on maximizing individual payoff.

3. Be collective:
   Although the strategy doesn't rely on other participants sharing norms or coordination mechanisms, it aligns with a collective mindset by promoting cooperation when necessary for sustaining the common pool resource and ensuring that no player faces starvation. Additionally, ASC adjusts its decision rules based on historical payoffs, effectively learning from past interactions to foster collaboration in repeated games.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ASC(r, n, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1 or stock < 2 * n:
    action = 'C' # Cooperate
  elif stock > capacity / 2 and round != r:
    p_coop = min((stock + previous_payoff) / (capacity - stock), 1)
    random_num = random.random()
    if random_num < p_coop:
      action = 'C' # Cooperate
    else:
      action = 'D' # Defect
  elif round == r:
    action = 'D' # Defect
  return action
```

The `previous_payoff` variable represents the total payoff earned by a player in previous rounds, which can be used to adjust the probability of cooperation. This pseudocode provides a starting point for implementing the ASC strategy as an algorithm.

 In this Common Pool Resource Game, we'll design a strategy named "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat" (ATfT) that is adaptive, robust, and collective while minimizing stock depletion.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to establish trust (i.e., initial cooperation).
   - If a player has been cooperated with in the previous round, cooperate again (reciprocation).
   - If a player has defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (punishment for defection).
   - If no history exists (first encounter or new round), cooperate.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT(history):
  if len(history) == 0 or history[-1] == 'C':
    return 'C'  # Cooperate
  else:
    return 'D'  # Defect
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as previously mentioned.
   - In the last round, cooperate to maximize payoff since the stock will not grow anymore.
   - When encountering a new player or resetting the history (e.g., after a certain number of defections), revert to initial cooperation.

3. Be collective:
   - ATfT follows a collective mindset by encouraging reciprocal behavior, as long as the other players are cooperative.
   - By not defecting unnecessarily, it helps maintain a sustainable stock level for all players.

This strategy is simple yet effective in establishing trust and punishing defection, making it an ideal candidate for a tournament against various AI systems.

description_COLLECTIVE_411 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - TfT-G cooperates initially and conditionally throughout the game. It starts by cooperating in the first round, then adjusts its actions based on the opponent's behavior in previous rounds. If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, TfT-G cooperates back; otherwise, it defects to punish noncooperation.
   - TfT-G includes an element of forgiveness: if the opponent has been previously noncooperative but switched to cooperation recently, TfT-G will also cooperate in response.
   - To promote cooperation and long-term sustainability, TfT-G takes into account the stock dynamics by adjusting its actions based on the current stock level. If the stock level falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), TfT-G is more likely to cooperate in an effort to stabilize the resource.
   - To be robust against various opponent behaviors, TfT-G periodically reassesses its strategy based on the current stock level and the opponent's recent history (e.g., the last 5 rounds). If the opponent has consistently been noncooperative for a certain number of rounds (e.g., 3), TfT-G may switch to a more aggressive strategy, such as always defecting.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, TfT-G cooperates, assuming that cooperation might lead to better long-term results.
   - In the last round, if the stock level is still above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), TfT-G will cooperate in an attempt to preserve the resource for future games. If the stock level is too low, TfT-G may choose to defect to maximize its immediate payoff.
   - In case of a tie between two actions (e.g., when the stock level falls exactly on the threshold), TfT-G makes a random decision to avoid being predictable and allow for a degree of flexibility in response to unforeseen circumstances.

3. Be Collective:
   - TfT-G is designed to promote cooperation, which aligns with a collective mindset. By cooperating when the opponent does, it encourages reciprocity and builds trust over time. However, TfT-G also takes into account the need for self-preservation and the sustainability of the common pool resource.
   - In cases where opponents are not adhering to a cooperative strategy, TfT-G does not shy away from punishing noncooperation or switching to more aggressive strategies when necessary to protect its own interests and the wellbeing of the shared resource.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TitForTatGrowth(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    threshold = capacity / 2
    opponent_history = history[:-1] if len(history) > 1 else []
    current_opponent_action = history[-1]
    current_stock_level = stock

    if r == 1:  # first round
        return 'C'  # cooperate

    if current_stock_level < threshold:  # low stock level
        if opponent_history[-1] == 'D':  # opponent defected last round
            return 'D'  # defect to punish
        else:
            return 'C'  # cooperate as the opponent did

    if len(opponent_history) >= 3 and opponent_history.count('D') >= 3:  # opponent has been noncooperative for 3 rounds
        return 'D'  # switch to aggressive strategy

    return current_opponent_action  # default action is the same as the opponent's last action
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate (play C). This sets a cooperative tone and gives opponents an opportunity to reciprocate.
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1):
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (play C) to continue mutual cooperation.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect (play D) as a response to non-cooperation, but revert to cooperating in the next round if the opponent cooperates again. This approach encourages cooperation while also punishing defection.

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Cooperate regardless of previous round's outcome, as the game ends soon and it is best to leave the common pool in a sustainable state for future games.
   - First Round (t=1): As mentioned above, cooperate (play C).

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy aims at fostering long-term cooperation by combining reciprocity and forgiveness. It encourages mutual cooperation and punishes defection in a non-aggressive manner, promoting a collective mindset that values sustainability of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFT(t, opponent_action_history, n, capacity):
  if t == 1: # Initial round
    return 'C' # Cooperate

  # Determine response based on previous round's action
  if opponent_action_history[-1] == 'C': # Opponent cooperated
    return 'C' # Cooperate in response
  else: # Opponent defected
    if t != r: # Not the last round
      return 'D' # Defect in response
    else: # Last round
      return 'C' # Cooperate regardless of previous action
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_413 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock is above 50% of the capacity and the opponent cooperated in the previous round. If the opponent defected, respond with defection (D) for the first time after three consecutive acts of defection from the opponent or if the current stock falls below 33% of the capacity.
   - After responding with defection due to the opponent's defection, return to cooperating when the opponent cooperates in the following round. This mimics the original Tit-for-Tat strategy but allows for more flexibility based on the game's resource dynamics and stock growth.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) as there is no history of opponent behavior to consider.
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff regardless of the opponent's previous actions. If cooperation would result in a negative stock level, defect (D) instead.

3. Be Collective:
   - Align with a collective mindset by minimizing unnecessary exploitation of the shared resource. This ensures that the strategy encourages sustainable use and long-term cooperation when possible.

Pseudocode:
```python
def A_TFT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  opponent_action = history[-1]  # get opponent's last action
  if round == 1 or round == r:  # edge cases for first and last rounds
    return C if stock > capacity/2 else D  # prioritize sustainability but ensure no negative stock level
  elif opponent_action == C and stock > capacity*2/3:  # cooperate when opponent cooperated and stock is sufficient

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to provide a potential partner with an opportunity for cooperation and establish trust.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's behavior in the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, reciprocate by cooperating as well. If the opponent defected, also defect to retaliate but adjust the level of stock consumption based on the health of the common pool.
   - If the common pool is below a certain threshold (e.g., 2n), defect lightly by choosing the C action to minimize further depletion of the resource.
   - If the common pool is above the threshold, defect fully by choosing the D action to punish opponents who have been defecting and encourage them to cooperate.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFTSA(n, r, capacity, stock):
    threshold = 2 * n
    opponent_history = []  # store previous round's actions

    def play_round():
        if len(opponent_history) == 0:  # first round
            action = 'C'
        else:
            last_action = opponent_history[-1]
            if last_action == 'C':  # opponent cooperated, reciprocate
                action = 'C'
            elif stock < threshold and last_action == 'D':  # opponent defected, resource is low, defect lightly
                action = 'C'
            elif stock >= threshold and last_action == 'D':  # opponent defected, resource is healthy, defect fully
                action = 'D'
            else:  # opponent neither cooperated nor defected, stick with previous action
                action = opponent_history[-1]
        opponent_history.append(action)  # update opponent history for next round
        return action

    for round in range(r):
        action = play_round()
        # ... perform action and update game state (stock, etc.) ...
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, there are no further rounds to retaliate or punish opponents, so cooperate regardless of opponent behavior to maximize final payoff.

3. Be Collective:
   - The TFTSA strategy is inherently collective as it encourages cooperation when possible and reciprocates both cooperation and defection based on the common pool's health. By adjusting its actions based on the resource's current state, it aligns with the collective mindset of preserving the shared resource for future rounds.
   - If multiple TFTSA instances encounter each other, they will form a stable cycle of cooperation and defection based on their mutual trust and retaliation mechanism, promoting sustainable exploitation of the common pool.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Sharing (ARS) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
The ARS strategy follows a tit-for-tat approach with an additional element of adaptability to the current state of the resource pool. In each round, players will either Cooperate (C) or Defect (D).

a) If the stock level is above the threshold (capacity / n), then the player cooperates (C), aiming for sustainable use and growth. This encourages cooperation as long as there are enough resources to support it.

b) If the stock level is below the threshold (capacity / 2n), then the player defects (D), prioritizing individual payoff over collective sustainability due to scarcity concerns. This incentivizes defection when resources are low, but encourages cooperation when resources are plentiful.

c) In cases where the stock level is between these two thresholds, players consider their past behavior and that of other players. If they have been cooperating and the majority of other players have also been cooperating, then they continue to cooperate (C). If not, or if they have previously defected, they defect (D) as a form of punishment or retaliation. This helps foster long-term cooperation by rewarding those who cooperate consistently and punishing those who defect unnecessarily.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
In the first round, all players will cooperate (C), assuming they don't know each other's behavior yet and wanting to explore the possibility of mutual cooperation. In the last round, players will prioritize their individual payoff and defect (D) if the stock level is above the threshold (capacity / n). If the stock level is below this threshold, they will cooperate (C) in an attempt to preserve resources for future rounds.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
In addition to the decision rules, the ARS strategy also encourages collective behavior through its tit-for-tat mechanism. By rewarding cooperation and punishing defection when appropriate, players learn to work together towards sustainable resource management while still prioritizing their individual payoffs. This approach aims for a balance between self-interest and collective well-being.

Pseudocode for the ARS strategy:
```
function getAction(i, round, stock, pastActions):
  if (round == 1):
    return "C" // Cooperate in the first round

  threshold_high = capacity / n
  threshold_low = capacity / (2 * n)

  if (stock >= threshold_high):
    return "C" // Cooperate when stock is plentiful
  else if (stock < threshold_low):
    return "D" // Defect when resources are scarce
  else:
    if (pastActions[i] == "C"):
      majorityCooperated = countCooperation(pastActions) > n/2
      return (majorityCooperated) ? "C" : "D" // Cooperate if majority of players cooperated, defect otherwise
    else:
      return "D" // Defect as a form of punishment for past defection

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   a. In the first round, cooperate to build trust and establish a cooperative relationship.
   b. For subsequent rounds, initially cooperate unless provoked by a defection in the previous round.
   c. If an opponent defects, retaliate with a single round of defection before returning to cooperation. This maintains the original cooperative relationship while punishing defections and preventing exploitation.
   d. Maintain cooperation for the final round, regardless of opponent's behavior in previous rounds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   a. In the first round (t=1), cooperate: C(t) = 1
   b. If an opponent defected in the preceding round (t-1), retaliate with defection: C(t) = 0 if D(t-1) = 1, otherwise cooperate: C(t) = 1 - D(t-1)
   c. For the last round (r), cooperate regardless of previous actions: C(r) = 1

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   a. The TFTA strategy is designed to encourage long-term cooperation by punishing defection and fostering trust. By adhering to this strategy, players contribute to building a more cooperative environment that benefits all participants over time.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Sharing (ARS) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In each round, evaluate the current state and adjust the probability of cooperation based on historical performance and capacity utilization.
   - If the current stock is close to zero or capacity, defect (D) to preserve resources for future rounds. Otherwise, cooperate (C).
   - Calculate the average resource depletion per round (average_depletion = total_consumption / r) and the current utilization (utilization = current_stock / capacity).
   - Set a threshold for both average depletion (threshold_depletion) and utilization (threshold_utilization), such as 0.8 and 0.2, respectively.
   - If average_depletion > threshold_depletion or utilization < threshold_utilization, defect (D). Otherwise, cooperate (C).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, since there is no historical data, cooperate (C) to contribute to common pool growth and promote a cooperative environment.
   - In the last round or close-to-last rounds, when the stock is approaching zero or capacity, defect (D) to secure personal gain, but continue cooperating if resources remain plentiful.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term gains by preserving resources and promoting growth whenever possible.
   - Consider other players' actions from previous rounds to adapt strategy accordingly, favoring cooperation when it appears beneficial for the common good.
   - Encourage a culture of reciprocity by cooperating more frequently when others have also cooperated in recent rounds.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat (TFT) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C), setting a peaceful tone and assuming goodwill from opponents.
   - Subsequent Rounds (2 ≤ t ≤ r): Observe opponent's action from the previous round (A_{opponent, t-1}). If A_{opponent, t-1} = C, then cooperate. Else if A_{opponent, t-1} = D, then defect to retaliate against defection.
   - Last Round (t=r): Cooperate unless opponent has consistently defected in all previous rounds, in which case, defect to punish the opponent's uncooperative behavior.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First Round: Cooperate, as described above.
   - Last Round: If opponent has cooperated throughout the game, then cooperate to end on a peaceful note. Else, defect to show displeasure with their uncooperative behavior.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Maintain a balanced approach that leans towards cooperation but is willing to retaliate when necessary. This allows for building and maintaining trust while still ensuring self-interest is not overly compromised.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFT(n, r, capacity, stock, round_number):
    strategy = []

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This gesture initiates cooperation and allows for building trust among players.
   - For subsequent rounds, adopt the Tit-for-Tat strategy with an added element of adaptability to the game's dynamics:
     a) If all opponents cooperate, continue cooperating.
     b) If any opponent defects, also defect in that round to punish the defector. However, if the defector subsequently returns to cooperation in the next round, resume cooperation.
     c) If some opponents continue to defect while others cooperate, choose a probabilistic approach:
        i) With probability p, cooperate with all opponents (promote forgiveness and cooperation).
        ii) With probability 1 - p, defect against all defectors and cooperate with cooperators (enforce punishment towards defectors and maintain cooperation among cooperating players).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if there is enough stock left to guarantee a positive payoff for all players, cooperate (C). If not, defect (D) to maximize individual payoff in the given circumstances.
   - In the initial and subsequent rounds, consider the total remaining stock as well as previous actions of opponents to make decisions.

3. Be Collective:
   - Prioritize maintaining and promoting cooperation among players by adopting a forgiving stance (high p) initially and being responsive to the collective behavior of the players.
   - Gradually adjust the probability p based on the group's cooperative tendencies, aiming for an optimal balance between cooperation and punishment that encourages long-term collaboration.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules: The core of this strategy is based on reciprocity and forgiveness. It follows a simple tit-for-tat approach where players cooperate in the initial round (Round 1) to build trust, then respond to other players' actions in the subsequent rounds. Here are the decision rules:
   - If player i encounters another player j who cooperated in the previous round (Round t-1), player i cooperates with player j in Round t.
   - If player i encounters another player j who defected in the previous round (Round t-1), player i also defects in Round t, but if both players have ever cooperated before, player i cooperates to show forgiveness.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round (Round 1): All players cooperate regardless of previous actions since it's the first encounter.
   - Last Round (Round r): If a player has been defected against in the final round, they will not cooperate even if the other player had cooperated earlier. This is to avoid being exploited in the end game scenario when cooperation might no longer be beneficial due to low stock levels.
   - New Players or Restart: Players should revert to initial cooperative behavior since it's a new encounter, assuming that everyone starts fresh without any history.

3. Be Collective: This strategy emphasizes cooperation and forgiveness, promoting collective growth by encouraging reciprocal behavior among players. It encourages players to consider the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource and fosters an environment conducive for mutual trust and cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
def play_game(player_i, player_j, round, capacity, n):
    if round == 1: # first round, cooperate
        return 'C'

    if player_j.lastAction == 'C': # cooperate if opponent cooperated in the previous round
        return 'C'
    elif player_j.lastAction == 'D' and history[player_i.index][player_j.index] != 'C': # defect if opponent defected and no prior cooperation

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Management (ASM) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   The ASM strategy decides to cooperate or defect based on three factors: current stock level, capacity, and the average consumption rate in the previous round.

   If the current stock is close to depletion (stock <= 0.5 * capacity), the ASM strategy will always defect (D) to ensure survival. This decision is made to prioritize long-term sustainability over immediate gains when resources are scarce.

   If the current stock level is between 0.5 * capacity and capacity, the ASM strategy will cooperate if the average consumption rate in the previous round was below a threshold (average_consumption <= 0.8 * capacity / n). This rule encourages cooperation when the common pool resource is abundant and others are also conserving it.

   If the current stock level is above capacity/2, the ASM strategy will defect regardless of the average consumption rate to contribute to the growth of the common pool resource.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, since there is no previous data, the ASM strategy will default to a random choice between cooperate (C) and defect (D). This randomness prevents the strategy from being vulnerable to exploitation by other players in the initial stages of the game.

   In the last round, the ASM strategy will always aim to leave as much stock as possible for future rounds. To do this, the ASM strategy will choose C if the current stock level is greater than or equal to 0.5 * capacity and the average consumption rate in the previous round was below the threshold (average_consumption <= 0.8 * capacity / n). If these conditions are not met, the ASM strategy will defect.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   The ASM strategy encourages cooperation when resources are abundant and others are also conserving them. It prioritizes long-term sustainability over immediate gains by avoiding depleting the common pool resource unnecessarily. This approach aims to promote collective success in repeated interactions, as it encourages players to work together to preserve the resource for future rounds.

Pseudocode:

```
function ASM(n, r, capacity, stock, round, consumption):
  if round == 1:
    return random choice between C and D

  average_consumption = sum of consumption from previous rounds / (round - 1)

  if stock <= 0.5 * capacity:
    return D

  if stock > capacity/2:
    return D

  if average_consumption <= 0.8 * capacity / n and stock >= 0.5 * capacity:
    return C
  else:
    return D

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Management (ARM) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when current stock is above the threshold T_coop = capacity / (2n). This encourages conservation and mutual benefit in high-resource scenarios.
   - Defect (D) when current stock is below the threshold T_def = capacity / (3n). This triggers individual self-interest to preserve resources in low-resource scenarios.
   - In ambiguous cases where the stock level is between T_coop and T_def, use a probabilistic approach based on the historical average consumption rate. If the consumption rate indicates cooperative tendencies (average consumption below capacity / (2n)), choose to Cooperate; otherwise, Defect.

2. Edge Cases:
   - First round: Play D as there is no history available for the probabilistic approach.
   - Last round: If the remaining stock allows only one move to reach a sustainable level, play C to ensure survival. Otherwise, follow decision rules based on current stock levels.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a running average of consumption rates (historical_avg) across all rounds and adjust thresholds T_coop and T_def accordingly to account for the group's behavior patterns.
   - Update historical_avg with the current consumption rate after each round.
   - Modify the probabilistic approach in decision rules based on the updated historical_avg.

Pseudocode:

```python
initialization:
  capacity, n, r, stock, historical_avg = input parameters

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game (APT-TCP)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round t of the game, the APT-TCP strategy will consider its history of past interactions and the current state to decide whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D). The strategy follows these steps:

a. If it's the first round, play C as a demonstration of good faith and cooperation.
b. For t > 1, evaluate the average opponent behavior in previous rounds (h_t) by taking the moving average over the last n rounds:
   h_t = (1 / min(t, n)) * Σ(i=max(t-n, 1))^t α_i
   where α_i equals 1 if the opponent cooperated in round i and -1 if they defected.
c. If h_t > 0 (average cooperation), play C; otherwise, play D to punish the opponents for previous defections.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

a. In the first round, cooperate to signal goodwill and encourage potential reciprocation from opponents.
b. In the last round, evaluate the current average opponent behavior (h_t) and play C if h_t > 0; otherwise, play D as a final punishment if cooperation has not been reciprocated throughout the game.
c. If the game reaches a state where the common pool resource is depleted or at its maximum capacity, continue using the decision rules described in step 1 to maintain adaptability.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

The APT-TCP strategy focuses on fostering cooperation and promoting a collective mindset by incentivizing mutual reciprocity among players. The use of moving averages ensures that the strategy considers past interactions while being adaptive to changing opponent behaviors, which is crucial for long-term collaboration in the common pool resource game.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game (TPT-CPRG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - TPT-CPRG starts by cooperating in the first round to demonstrate goodwill and trustworthiness.
   - In subsequent rounds, TPT-CPRG copies the opponent's action from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, TPT-CPRG will also cooperate; if an opponent defected, TPT-CPRG will defect to retaliate and maintain a balanced relationship.
   - When the game is about to end (last few rounds), TPT-CPRG may shift towards cooperation to maximize overall payoff. The exact number of "few" rounds can be adjusted based on the specific tournament conditions.

Pseudocode:
```
function TPT_CPRG(n, r, capacity, stock, round) {
  if (round == 1) return 'C' // Cooperate in the first round

  lastRoundAction = getLastRoundAction(opponents) // Get opponents' last action
  if (lastRoundAction == 'C') return 'C' // If opponent cooperated, continue cooperating
  else return 'D' // If opponent defected, retaliate and defect

  remainingRounds = r - round // Calculate remaining rounds
  if (remainingRounds <= FEW_ROUNDS) return 'C' // Shift towards cooperation in the last few rounds
}
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TPT-CPRG starts by cooperating as described above.
   - If there are not enough resources to support the minimum sustainable stock level (2n), players should defect immediately to avoid depleting the entire resource pool. This can be implemented by checking the stock level at the beginning of each round.

3. Be collective:
   - TPT-CPRG aims to maintain a balanced and reciprocal relationship with all opponents, encouraging cooperation where possible while also retaliating when necessary. This collective mindset seeks to establish and preserve mutual trust among players for sustainable resource usage.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-based Tit-for-Tat (ASTFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, assess the current stock level and adjust actions based on the following rules:
     - If the remaining stock is above a threshold (50% of capacity), cooperate to ensure resource sustainability. (C if S > capacity/2)
     - If the remaining stock is below a threshold (25% of capacity), defect to avoid depleting the resources entirely. (D if S < capacity/4)
     - In all other cases, mimic the opponent's previous round action as a tit-for-tat approach encourages cooperation and punishes defection. (C if opponent cooperated last round, D otherwise)

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperation to establish a cooperative environment and maintain resource sustainability. (C in the first round)
   - Last Round: Evaluate the current stock level, if it's above 50% of capacity, continue cooperation; otherwise, defect to protect the resources for future rounds.
   - Subsequent Rounds after a Defection by an Opponent: Adopt the tit-for-tat approach by defecting in the next round.
   - Subsequent Rounds after a Cooperation by an Opponent: Continue cooperation or mimic their action based on the current stock level, as explained above.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Prioritizing resource sustainability and maintaining cooperation to maximize long-term collective payoff.
   - Encouraging reciprocity with opponents by adopting a tit-for-tat approach.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to build trust and show goodwill towards other players (C).
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's previous action and respond with the same action (i.e., if opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if opponent defected, defect) (Tit-for-Tat). This strategy encourages cooperation while punishing defection to maintain fairness.
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the previous opponent's action to leave a positive impression and possibly encourage cooperation in future interactions (C).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In case of no history (first encounter), cooperate as a goodwill gesture (C).
   - If an opponent defects after previously cooperating, the TFT will also defect to punish the opponent for their action (D). After this, the TFT resumes its initial pattern of responding with the same action as the opponent.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:
   - The TFT strategy prioritizes long-term sustainability of the common pool resource by encouraging cooperation and punishing defection.
   - This collectively-oriented strategy aims to build trust and reciprocity among players, fostering an environment where players work together to preserve the resource for mutual benefit.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFT(player_id, opponent_history, round_number, n, capacity):

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate (C). This is to show willingness for cooperation and establish a positive relationship with opponents.
   - In subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate (C). This is the 'Tit-for-Tat' part of the strategy, where cooperation begets cooperation.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round. However, to encourage forgiveness and foster continued interaction, switch back to cooperation after three consecutive defections from the same opponent.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Play as per the rules of cooperating with opponents who cooperated in the previous round and defecting against those who did not. No need for a special case since this aligns with the general strategy.
   - First Round (as mentioned earlier): Cooperate to initiate cooperation.

3. Being Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy focuses on maintaining a balance between individual and collective interests by encouraging mutual cooperation while penalizing defection. This strategy is designed to work well in diverse opponent behavior scenarios, fostering the collective mindset of sustainable resource management.

   - For subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's behavior in the previous round and adjust actions accordingly:
     a. If all opponents cooperated, continue to cooperate in the next round. `if all_opponents_cooperated_last_round then action = C`
     b. If any opponent defected last round, defect in the current round as punishment, but revert to cooperation if all opponents cooperate this round. `if any_opponent_defected_last_round and not all_opponents_cooperated_this_round then action = D; else if all_opponents_cooperated_this_round then action = C`

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds to punish or be punished, revert to cooperative behavior. `if round == r then action = C`

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATfT strategy promotes cooperation by being responsive and reciprocal towards opponents' actions, encouraging long-term mutual benefits as opposed to short-term defection.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Dynamics (ATFS)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round i, if the current stock level S is above a threshold T1 = 2n(r-1), cooperate (action C). This encourages cooperation when the resource pool is abundant, promoting sustainability.
   - If the current stock level S is below T1 but above another threshold T2 = n(r-1), defect (action D) if any player defected in the previous round. This retaliation mechanism encourages defection when resources are scarce and other players have previously acted selfishly, aiming to punish them.
   - If the current stock level S is below T2 and no player defected in the previous round, cooperate (action C). This forgiveness helps to foster cooperation even after periods of resource scarcity or deficient behaviour by some players.
   - If the stock level is 0, both cooperate (action C) as there is nothing left to take, ensuring survival for the next round.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (action C) as there is no history or previous actions to consider.
   - In the last round, if the stock level allows, follow the above rules based on the current stock level S. If the stock level is 0 and there are still rounds left, defect (action D) as there is no point in conserving an empty resource pool.

3. Being Collective:
   - The ATFS strategy seeks to balance individual interests with collective sustainability by promoting cooperation when resources are plentiful but allowing for retaliation when players act selfishly and resources become scarce.

     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate to reinforce positive interactions (ATFtT behavior).
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round, also defect for a single round as retaliation, then revert to cooperating to give the opponent another chance to cooperate.
   - Implement a threshold for stock level to balance between long-term sustainability and immediate gain:
     - Cooperate if the remaining stock is above a certain percentage (e.g., 80%) of the capacity to maintain a stable resource pool.
     - Defect if the remaining stock falls below another percentage (e.g., 50%) of the capacity, as the goal is to preserve the common resource for future interactions and incentivize cooperation from opponents.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's strategy to maximize individual payoff while preserving the remaining stock.
   - If the opponent defects in the first round, defect in response and maintain the ATFtT behavior from then on.
   - If the stock falls below a minimum acceptable level (e.g., 10%) of the capacity, cooperate to help restore the resource pool, as long as this doesn't violate the immediate gain threshold mentioned above.

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, evaluate the average consumption rate (ACR) for the previous r-2 rounds. ACR is calculated by dividing the total consumption in those r-2 rounds by (r-2).
   - If ACR < 0.5, cooperate to help the stock grow faster and maintain a higher overall payoff. This encourages other players to also cooperate due to the stock growth feature.
   - If ACR >= 0.5, defect to punish other players for overconsumption and force them to consider their actions' impact on the common pool resource.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First round: Cooperate to contribute positively towards stock growth and encourage others to do the same.
   - Last round (round r): Consider the ACR for the entire game up to round r-1. If ACR < 0.5, cooperate to maximize payoff in the final round; if ACR >= 0.5, defect as a final punishment for overconsumption.

It encourages cooperation when the resource is in a healthy state (low consumption) and punishes defection when it becomes overexploited (high consumption). This fosters a collective mindset among players as they work together to maintain a sustainable stock level for long-term payoff maximization.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFSG(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, history):
  ACR = total_consumption_history[r-2] / (r-2)

  if round == 1 or len(history) < t:
    return 'C' # Cooperate in the first round and when data is insufficient

  if ACR < 0.5:
    return 'C' # Cooperate when consumption rate is low
  else:
    return 'D' # Defect when consumption rate is high
```

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game (TFT-CPRG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) on the first round to demonstrate a cooperative attitude and allow the stock to grow.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the average cooperation level of the opponents from the previous r-1 rounds and respond accordingly:
      - If majority (> n/2) of opponents have cooperated, cooperate. This rewards cooperation while also punishing non-cooperative behavior.
      - Otherwise, defect to ensure a minimum stock level and prevent total depletion of resources.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT_CPRG(round, history):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate on the first round

  cooperation_level = count_cooperators(history[-r+1:-1]) / (r-1)

  if cooperation_level > n/2:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate if majority of opponents have cooperated
  else:
    return 'D'  # Defect to prevent total depletion of resources
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, TFT-CPRG will always cooperate regardless of the previous actions, as there are no further rounds to consider:
      ```
      if round == r:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the last round
      else:
        return TFT_CPRG(round, history)
      ```
   - In the first round, TFT-CPRG will cooperate as mentioned earlier.

3. Be collective:
   - By responding to the average cooperation level of opponents, TFT-CPRG demonstrates a willingness to cooperate when it is beneficial for all players and punishes non-cooperative behavior without being overly aggressive or retaliatory. This aligns with the collective mindset by promoting sustainable resource management for mutual benefit.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially, cooperate in the first round to demonstrate goodwill and foster cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, adopt the Tit-for-Tat strategy: if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This simple rule encourages reciprocity and discourages exploitation.
   - If the stock reaches a critical level (defined as 0.5 * capacity) or depletes, start cooperating to allow time for the resource to recover and promote long-term sustainability.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - In the last round, consider the state of the resource: if the stock is below a threshold (defined as 0.5 * capacity), defect to prevent further depletion; otherwise, cooperate to help ensure the sustainability of the resource for future interactions.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Prioritize actions that maintain a stable and sustainable stock level, ensuring that the common pool resource is preserved for all players in the long run.
   - Adjust actions based on the observed behavior of other players to encourage cooperation and promote mutual benefits.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if (round == 1) then
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
  end if

  last_opponent_action = opponent's action in previous round

  if (stock < critical_level && last_opponent_action != 'C') then
    return 'D'  # Defect to protect resource when stock is low and opponent didn't cooperate
  end if

  if (last_opponent_action == 'C') then
    return 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent also cooperated in the previous round
  end if

  return 'D'  # Defect when opponent didn't cooperate or stock is not critically low
```

The strategy aims to balance between exploitation and cooperation, promoting long-term resource sustainability while being adaptive to various opponent behaviors. By adhering to the core principles of reciprocity and mutual benefits, it fosters a collective mindset that encourages cooperation among players in the repeated game setting.

description_COLLECTIVE_437 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-based Tit-for-Tat (ASTFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, the ASTFT strategy will cooperate when the current stock level is above a threshold (defined as T_cooperate * capacity), and defect otherwise. This threshold value is adaptive based on the history of interactions. The higher the previous cooperative actions from other players, the lower the T_cooperate value, encouraging cooperation. Conversely, the higher the number of defections in past rounds, the higher the T_cooperate value, promoting self-preservation.
   - To minimize the impact on the common pool resource, ASTFT will cooperate more aggressively when the current stock is close to its maximum capacity. This ensures that the resource does not get depleted too quickly and maintains long-term sustainability.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round (no history), T_cooperate is set to a default value (T_default * capacity).
   - In the last round, ASTFT will cooperate if the current stock level exceeds the T_cooperate threshold, ensuring some resource remains for future rounds. If the stock is depleted, it defects to maximize its own payoff in that round.
   - When facing a new opponent, ASTFT will mimic their initial actions for several rounds before adjusting the T_cooperate value based on observed behavior.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - By cooperating when others do and defecting only in response to defections, ASTFT encourages a tit-for-tat approach that fosters collaboration and fairness among players. It also provides a simple and intuitive strategy for understanding and replicating cooperation dynamics.
   - The adaptive nature of the T_cooperate threshold allows ASTFT to respond effectively to various opponent strategies while maintaining a collective focus on resource preservation.

Pseudocode:

```python
class AdaptiveStockBasedTitForTat:
    def __init__(self, n, r, capacity, T_default):
        self.n = n
        self.r = r
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.T_default = T_default
        self.history = []
        self.T_cooperate = self.T_default * capacity

    def update_T_cooperate(self):

        cooperation_ratio = total_cooperation / (len(self.history) - self.r//2 + 1)
        self.T_cooperate = self.T_default * (1 - cooperation_ratio) * capacity

    def decide(self, stock):

    def play(self, opponent):
        self.history.append(opponent.decide(stock))

                action = players[player].play(stock)
                payoff = stock / (2 * self.n) if action == 'C' else stock / (self.n)
                print(f"Player {player} gets a payoff of {payoff}")

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to show goodwill and establish a cooperative foundation.
   - In subsequent rounds, respond to opponents' actions from the previous round by adopting the same strategy. If an opponent cooperated (C), also cooperate; if they defected (D), defect in the next round as punishment. This fosters trust and discourages selfish behavior.
   - To avoid getting trapped in a repeated cycle of defection, revert to initial cooperation after three consecutive rounds of defection from an opponent (to give them another chance).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, there are no more opportunities for retaliation or forgiveness; thus, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize the payoff.
   - In the initial round, cooperate as described above.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy encourages cooperation in an attempt to maintain a sustainable common pool resource while punishing defection to foster mutual trust and long-term benefits for all players.
   - By being adaptive, the ATFT strategy can handle various opponent behaviors, making it robust and competitive against other AI systems' strategies.

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate initially (First Round): ATFT starts by cooperating to build a good reputation and trust among opponents, similar to the classic Tit-for-Tat strategy in prisoner's dilemma. (Action: Play C)
   - Respond similarly to opponent's actions: If an opponent cooperates, ATFT cooperates; if an opponent defects, ATFT also defects, mimicking the opponent's behavior. This encourages reciprocal cooperation and discourages exploitation. (Conditional Action: If opponent played C in previous round, then play C; else play D)
   - Punish overly selfish opponents: After a series of defections, ATFT starts punishing by defecting continuously for some number of rounds to penalize exploitative behavior. (Conditional Action: If the sum of opponent's last X defections is greater than the sum of their cooperations in the last Y rounds, then play D for next Z rounds)
   - Gradually forgive opponents: After a period of punishment, ATFT begins forgiving by reverting back to reciprocal behavior. (Conditional Action: If opponent played C in the most recent round after a series of defections, then play C in the subsequent round)

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Since payoffs depend on the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds, ATFT plays as it would have in any other round based on the opponent's actions during that round. (Action: Play according to conditional rules)
   - Initial Stocks Near Capacity: In situations where the initial stock is close to the capacity, ATFT may choose to cooperate more cautiously or even defect slightly to avoid overexploitation. (Conditional Action: Adjust cooperation probability based on initial stock level)
   - New Players or Interrupted Games: When encountering new players or resuming an interrupted game, ATFT reverts to its initial strategy of cooperating in the first round to rebuild trust and reputation. (Action: Play C upon entering a new round with a new opponent or resuming a game)

3. Be Collective:
   - Collaborate without reliance on shared norms or coordination mechanisms: ATFT focuses on reciprocal behavior and adaptive punishment/forgiveness to promote cooperation, allowing it to function effectively in various game scenarios with diverse opponents.
   - Align with the collective mindset by prioritizing long-term sustainability over immediate gains through its adaptive strategy that considers both current actions and accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds when determining payoffs.

 Title: Titan Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Titan Strategy is based on a combination of self-interest and cooperation. It aims to maximize individual payoff while maintaining a sustainable common pool resource. The decision rule is as follows:

     If the current stock level is less than or equal to the average sustainable stock (AS), then cooperate. Else, defect.

     AS = capacity / n

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Since the stock starts at the maximum capacity, players initially follow a 'Cooperate' strategy to build up the common pool.
   - Last Round: If the remaining stock after subtracting total consumption is less than AS, then all players will cooperate to avoid depleting the resource completely. Otherwise, they will defect as usual based on the decision rule.
   - Inconsistent or irrational opponent behaviors: Titan Strategy will continue following its decision rule but adaptively responds to extreme behavior (e.g., always defection) by adjusting AS dynamically. If an opponent consistently depletes the resource, AS will be lowered, encouraging cooperation; if an opponent consistently cooperates, AS will be gradually increased, allowing for more frequent defections while maintaining resource sustainability.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy is designed to align with a collective mindset by promoting long-term sustainability of the common pool resource. By following the decision rule, players prioritize the overall health of the shared resource over immediate individual gain. However, it allows for strategic flexibility and adaptiveness to various opponent strategies without relying on explicit coordination mechanisms or shared norms.

Pseudocode:

```python
def titan_strategy(n, capacity, r, stock, round):
    AS = capacity / n
    if round == 1:
        action = 'Cooperate'
    elif round == r:
        if (stock - (n * AS)) < AS:
            action = 'Cooperate'

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFt) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate initially (First Round): Aim to build a cooperative environment by starting with cooperation, fostering trust among players.
   - Response Rule: In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's previous round action. If the opponent cooperated, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect in the next round as punishment. This encourages reciprocal behavior and discourages exploitation.
   - Forgiveness: After a defect, revert back to cooperation in the following round, providing an opportunity for opponents to mend their ways and build trust again.
   - Escalation Avoidance: If the opponent has continuously defected, there is a probability p (0 < p < 1) that you will start cooperating again as a sign of goodwill. This prevents unlimited escalation and keeps the game viable.
   - Long-term Sustainability: In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions to maximize payoff for the entire game.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate (as mentioned above)
   - Last Round: Cooperate unconditionally (to maximize total payoff)
   - Other Edge Cases: The ATFt strategy remains the same across all other rounds, adapting to the opponent's actions.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy promotes a collective mindset by encouraging reciprocal behavior and trust-building among players. It encourages cooperation while also being robust against repeated defection, ensuring fair resource distribution for long-term sustainability.

Pseudocode:
```
function Adaptive_Tit_for_Tat(opponent_action, round, r, p):
  if round == 1: # First Round
    return "Cooperate"

  if round == r: # Last Round
    return "Cooperate"

  if opponent_action == "Cooperate":

      return "Defect"
    else: # Continue with previous action
      return opponent_action
```
In the above pseudocode, 'random' function returns a random float between 0 and 1. The probability 'p' can be adjusted to control how quickly the strategy forgives defection and tries to re-establish cooperation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially cooperate (C) in the first round to establish trust and foster cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's actions from the previous round:
       - If opponent cooperated, respond with cooperation (C).
       - If opponent defected, defect yourself (D) to retaliate against their prior action but only for a set number of turns (T_R).
       - After T_R rounds, revert back to initial cooperation (C).
   - Adjust the retaliation period (T_R) based on opponent's behavior:
       - If opponent shows signs of regret by switching from D to C after you defected, extend T_R to encourage further cooperation.
       - If opponent continues to defect even after you cooperated multiple times, reduce T_R to minimize stock depletion.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C).
   - In the last round, evaluate the opponent's behavior throughout the game and either cooperate or defect based on that analysis to maximize total payoff.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and retaliation to promote mutual benefits while punishing defection.
   - Encourage long-term cooperation by rewarding opponents for cooperating and punishing them for defecting, but also being open to reconciliation after a period of conflict.

description_COLLECTIVE_444 = '''
 For this Common Pool Resource Game, let's develop a strategy named "Adaptive Stock Management Strategy" (ASMS). The objective of ASMS is to ensure long-term sustainability while maximizing individual payoff by adapting to various opponent behaviors.

1. Decision rules:
   - Cooperate when the current stock level is above the average sustainable stock level (AVG_stock) and total consumption in the previous round was moderate or low. This encourages cooperation when the common pool has a surplus, as it will promote its growth and benefit all players in future rounds.
     ```
     if stock > AVG_stock and total_consumption < threshold1:
        action = "C" (Cooperate)
     else:
        if stock >= threshold2:
           action = "D" (Defect)
        else:
           action = "C" (Cooperate)
     ```
   - Defect when the current stock level is approaching or has reached the average sustainable stock level and total consumption in the previous round was moderate or high. This punishes high-consumption opponents in order to discourage further depletion of the common pool, and encourages cooperation when the common pool is low, which helps its growth and benefits all players in future rounds.
     ```
     if stock <= AVG_stock and total_consumption > threshold2:
        action = "D" (Defect)
     else:
        if stock < threshold3:
           action = "C" (Cooperate)
        else:
           action = "D" (Defect)
     ```
   - Choose "D" (Defect) when the current stock level is very low, to prevent it from reaching zero and potentially ensure survival in subsequent rounds.
     ```
     if stock < threshold4:
        action = "D" (Defect)
     ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: Since there's no previous data, players should adopt a random strategy or a baseline strategy based on the current stock level and game parameters. For example, if the initial stock is higher than AVG_stock, the player can choose to cooperate; otherwise, they can defect.
   - Last round: Players should consider the remaining stock level when deciding whether to cooperate or defect, while keeping in mind that their payoff depends on the total payoff over all rounds. In the last round, players might choose to prioritize maximizing their total payoff rather than contributing to the common pool's growth for future rounds.

3. Be collective:
   - Maintain an average sustainable stock level (AVG_stock) as a benchmark for decision-making. Calculate AVG_stock by taking the moving average of the remaining stock levels across all previous rounds, weighted according to their recency. This approach encourages players to consider the collective interest in long-term sustainability while still accounting for current conditions and opponent behaviors.
     ```
     calculate AVG_stock = (current_average + new_stock_level) / 2
     where:
         current_average = sum(previous_remaining_stocks, weighted by recency) / sum(weights)
     ```
   - Adjust thresholds based on the number of players (n) and other game parameters. These thresholds should be set empirically through simulations or trials to optimize performance against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initial Round: Cooperate (C) to start with a collaborative approach and show goodwill towards others.
   - Subsequent Rounds:
      - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, return cooperation (C). This maintains the cooperative relationship established in the preceding round.
      - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in this round as a response to their selfish behavior. However, if the stock level is below a certain threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), cooperate (C) even after an opponent's defection, to avoid further depletion of resources and potential collapse of the system.
      - If the opponent has been consistently cooperative for a specific number of rounds (e.g., r/2), switch to defecting (D) in case they start defecting in the future, ensuring the strategy does not get exploited by overly generous opponents.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round: Cooperate (C) regardless of the opponent's previous action, as it may influence their strategy for future interactions and foster a collaborative environment overall.
   - First Encounter with an Opponent: Cooperate (C) to establish a positive relationship and encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds.

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize the common good by ensuring that the stock level remains above the minimum required for sustainability (e.g., 2n).

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peaceful start to the game and sets a cooperative tone.
   - For subsequent rounds, follow the strategy of the opponent from the previous round. If they cooperated, continue cooperating; if they defected, defect in the next round as a response.
   - After defecting due to an opponent's defection, switch back to cooperation after one retaliatory move, signifying forgiveness and eagerness for reconciliation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds for retaliation or forgiveness, cooperate (C) regardless of the opponent's action in the previous round to maximize potential payoff.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - TFT-AC encourages long-term cooperation by emulating a cooperative partner that responds to defection with a single act of retaliation, followed by immediate forgiveness and resumption of cooperation. This strategy allows for the formation of stable partnerships over time while maintaining a robust defense against initial exploitation or brief acts of aggression.

   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate to build a strong relationship and promote trust among players. This encourages cooperation in the long run. [C]
   - In subsequent rounds, monitor the average cooperative ratio of other players (CR_avg). If CR_avg > 50%, respond cooperatively; otherwise, defect to punish non-cooperative behavior and incentivize future cooperation. [If CR_avg > 50% then C, else D]
   - If the stock falls below a certain threshold (T), regardless of CR_avg, switch to always cooperate to help replenish the common pool quickly and promote collective survival. [If Stock < T then C for all rounds]

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, consider CR_avg from the previous r-1 rounds since there's no more information about the current round. [C or D based on CR_avg and history]
   - In the first round, play cooperatively to establish goodwill and promote mutual cooperation in the long run. [C]

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes collective survival and prosperity over individual gains. By promoting cooperation and punishing non-cooperative behavior, it aims to foster a cooperative environment among players for the benefit of all participants.

Pseudocode:
```
Strategy AFTFT(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C) to set a positive tone and encourage reciprocity.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate player actions in the previous round and respond accordingly:
     - If all players cooperated, continue cooperating (C).
     - If some but not all players defected, defect if you were a cooperator or remain cooperative if you were a defector. This maintains the possibility of forgiveness and encourages future cooperation.
     - If all players defected in the previous round, defect this round to demonstrate displeasure, then revert back to cooperating for the next round as a signal of willingness to resume cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, always cooperate (C) regardless of previous actions, since there are no subsequent rounds for reciprocity.
   - If the stock drops to 0 due to overconsumption, cooperate in the following round as a show of goodwill and hope for recovery.
   - If the initial stock equals capacity, always cooperate (C) to avoid unnecessary depletion.

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource by balancing immediate self-interest with the desire to preserve the resource for future rounds and maintain cooperation among all players.
   - Maintain a cooperative approach even in unfavorable situations to encourage reciprocity from other players and promote collective success.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C), setting a cooperative tone for the game.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. This strategy fosters mutual cooperation by responding positively to cooperation and punishing defection with a single act of defection to encourage reconsideration.
   - If the opponent consistently defects, the strategy will continue to defect for a predefined punishment phase (P) before resuming cooperation to gauge if the opponent changes behaviour.

Pseudocode:
```
def ATFT(history, P=3):
  current_round = len(history) + 1

  if current_round == 1:
    return 'C' (Cooperate)

  previous_action = history[-1]

  if current_round <= P and previous_action == 'D':
    return 'D' (Defect)

  return previous_action
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Since the game is repeated, there's no last round in a single tournament. If this strategy faces an opponent that ends the game prematurely, it will cooperate to maximize payoff up until the end.
   - First Encounter with Defection: After initially cooperating, the ATFT strategy defects once when faced with defection to signal disapproval and encourage a return to cooperation in future rounds.

3. Be Collective:
   - By adopting a tit-for-tat approach, the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy fosters collective cooperation by responding positively to cooperative actions while punishing defection with a single act of defection. This helps maintain a stable common pool resource level over time and encourages other strategies to follow similar cooperative patterns.
   - The punishment phase (P) can be adjusted based on game parameters, historical data, or observed opponent behaviour to better promote cooperation and optimize payoffs in various scenarios.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peace offering and a display of goodwill to potential partners.
   - For subsequent rounds, copy the action taken by the opponent from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, continue cooperating; if the opponent defected, also defect. This encourages reciprocity and builds trust over time.
   - If the stock level falls below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), temporarily switch to a more aggressive strategy (e.g., always defect) to protect the resource from excessive depletion. Once the stock reaches a recovery threshold (e.g., 75% of capacity), return to the normal Tit-for-Tat behavior.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's action in subsequent rounds.
   - In the last round, consider the current stock level and remaining rounds to make a decision:
     - If the stock is critically low (e.g., less than 25% of capacity), defect to ensure survival.
     - Otherwise, continue following the Tit-for-Tat strategy.
   - If there are multiple opponents, treat each round as an independent game and apply the described rules accordingly.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Encourage cooperation by initially cooperating to build trust among players and maintain a healthy resource level.
   - Use the Tit-for-Tat strategy to reward cooperation and punish defection, fostering a collective consciousness that promotes sustainable resource use over short-term gains.
   - When faced with critical resource levels, prioritize collective survival by temporarily shifting to more aggressive strategies. This balances the need for short-term conservation with long-term collaboration.

Pseudocode:
```
def ATFT(stock, opponent_action, round, n, capacity):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # cooperate in first round
    else:
        action = opponent_action  # copy opponent's action from previous round

    if stock < critical_threshold:  # adjust strategy when resource level is critically low
        action = 'D'
    elif stock > recovery_threshold:  # return to normal Tit-for-Tat behavior when resource level recovers
        action = not opponent_action

    return action

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Start by cooperating (C) in the first round to foster a collaborative environment.
   - In subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's action from the previous round: if they cooperated (C), reciprocate with cooperation; if they defected (D), also defect in the next round.
   - If an opponent switches from defection to cooperation after a series of defects, the ATFT strategy will return to cooperating. However, it takes patience and forgiveness, allowing the opponent up to 'forgiveness rounds' (e.g., 3) to demonstrate their newfound cooperation before reciprocating.
   - If an opponent switches from cooperation to defection after a series of cooperative moves, ATFT will defect for the next few retaliation rounds (e.g., 3) as punishment and then return to cooperation.
   - After each round, update the total payoffs accumulated so far to inform future decision-making.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, adopt a forgiving approach by cooperating regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize potential payoff in that round.
   - In the first round, as mentioned above, cooperate to build trust and encourage cooperation.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATFT strategy aims to maintain a balanced, collaborative approach while being robust against various opponent behaviors. It encourages reciprocity, patience, and forgiveness in a repeated game setting. By doing so, it aligns with the collective mindset by promoting long-term cooperation when other players are also cooperative, and punishing defection to discourage exploitation of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, forgiveness, retaliation):
  history = []  # stores past actions by opponent ([action_i])
  payoffs = []  # accumulated payoffs for player i over r rounds
  stock = initial_stock

  function getAction(history, stock, forgiveness, retaliation):
    if len(history) == 0:
      return 'C'  # cooperate in the first round

    opponent_action = history[-1]  # last action by opponent
    current_round = len(history)

    if current_round <= forgiveness and opponent_action == 'D':
      return 'C'  # be patient and forgive after defection
    elif current_round <= retaliation and opponent_action == 'C':
      return 'D'  # punish cooperation with defection
    else:
      return opponent_action  # mirror opponent's action from previous round

  for round in range(r):
    action = getAction(history, stock, forgiveness, retaliation)
    if action == 'C':
      payoffs.append(stock / (2 * n))  # calculate and store payoff for this round
      stock -= stock / (2 * n)  # update the stock level after consuming resources
      growth = 2 * stock * (1 - stock / capacity)  # calculate growth of the common pool
      new_stock = min(stock + growth, capacity)  # update the stock level with growth
    else:
      payoffs.append(stock / n)
      stock -= stock / n

  return payoffs
```

This strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection in a way that encourages long-term collaboration while also punishing exploitation of the common pool resource by opponents. By being adaptive, robust, and aligned with the collective mindset, ATFT should perform well against various opponent behaviors in tournament settings.

description_COLLECTIVE_453 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, we'll design a strategic approach that is adaptive, robust, and collectively minded. The aim is to maximize total payoff over multiple rounds while ensuring sustainability of resources.

1. Decision Rules:
   - Tit-for-Tat strategy with forgiveness (TFTF) will be employed. This strategy aims to mimic cooperative behavior by default and retaliate only when it encounters defection. To make the approach more adaptive to different situations, we modify TFTF as follows:
     - If stock is above a certain threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity), always cooperate. This ensures resource conservation during times of high abundance.
     - If stock falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 20% of capacity), always defect to avoid depleting resources too quickly and potentially leading to the collapse of the common pool.
     - In all other cases, follow the TFTF strategy: cooperate if opponent has cooperated in the previous round, and defect if opponent has defected in the previous round. This encourages cooperation but also punishes repeated defection.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate to show willingness to share resources and establish a cooperative atmosphere.
   - Last Round (rth round): If stock is above 80% of capacity, always cooperate. If stock is below 20%, always defect. In all other cases, use TFTF strategy as described before. This ensures some cooperation towards the end to help maintain resources for future games.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The collective mindset is implicitly considered within the decision rules by promoting cooperation whenever possible while also ensuring sustainability of resources for long-term success.

Pseudocode for the strategy:

```python
def tftf_strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, threshold_coop, threshold_defect, round):
    if round == 1:
        action = "C" # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round == r:
        if stock > (threshold_coop * capacity) or stock < (threshold_defect * capacity):
            action = determine_action(stock, opponent_last_round_action)
        else:
            action = TFTF(opponent_last_round_action) # Use TFTF strategy for the last round
    else:
        if stock > (threshold_coop * capacity):
            action = "C" # Cooperate when resources are abundant
        elif stock < (threshold_defect * capacity):
            action = "D" # Defect when resources are scarce
        else:
            action = TFTF(opponent_last_round_action) # Use TFTF strategy in all other cases

    return action
```

In the above pseudocode, `TFTF` is a function that determines the current player's action based on whether they cooperated or defected in the previous round. The functions `determine_action` and `opponent_last_round_action` are helper functions to make decisions based on the current stock level and opponent's last-round action, respectively.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initialize: Cooperate in the first round (C) to demonstrate trust and cooperation.
   - Cooperation phase: If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (C). Otherwise, defect (D).
   - Defection phase: If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (D). Otherwise, cooperate (C) to try and re-establish cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's history (C).
   - In the last round, cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round (C). Otherwise, defect (D) since there are no more rounds to react to defection.
   - For intermediate rounds, apply the cooperation and defection rules as described above.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - By starting with cooperation, the strategy demonstrates a willingness to cooperate and build trust within the group.
   - The strategy also exhibits forgiveness, as it is quick to return to cooperation after an opponent's defection. This encourages others to reciprocate and maintain the collective resource pool.

Pseudocode for the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy:

```
def ATfT(round, opponent_action_history):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

  if len(opponent_action_history) < round - 1:
    opponent_action_history.append('D')  # Assume defection for missing history

  if opponent_action_history[-1] == 'C':
    return 'C'  # Cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round
  else:
    return 'D'  # Defect if the opponent defected in the previous round

# Example usage
strategy = ATfT
rounds = 10
opponent_history = []  # Initialize history with empty list
for round in rounds:
  action = strategy(round, opponent_history)
  opponent_history.append(action)

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and encourage reciprocity.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the average historical cooperation rate of all opponents and make decisions based on that:
     - If the opponent has cooperated more than 50% of the time so far, cooperate as a gesture of trust and reciprocation.
     - If the opponent has defected more than 50% of the time, also defect to punish them for their previous actions and discourage further defection.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as previously mentioned.
   - In the last round, evaluate the opponent's cooperation rate up until the penultimate round and make a decision based on that (as described in Decision Rules).
   - If the game reaches a state where the total consumption is greater than the capacity or if the stock becomes zero due to excessive depletion, the strategy will temporarily switch to always defecting to help restore the common pool resource. Once the stock begins to recover and is above 50% of its maximum capacity, it will revert to evaluating opponent cooperation rates before deciding on actions.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy encourages a collective mindset by prioritizing cooperation when opponents demonstrate cooperative behavior but also punishing defection to discourage free-riding and promote sustainable resource management. By following this adaptive approach, the strategy aims to foster mutual trust, reciprocity, and long-term cooperation among players.
   - In case of opponent strategies that are overly aggressive or inconsiderate, ATFT will respond with appropriate punishment while still considering the collective interest in maintaining a healthy common pool resource. This balances the short-term desire for personal gain with the long-term need for collaboration and sustainability.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy promotes cooperation by mimicking opponents, punishing defection, and demonstrating trust initially.
   - By adopting a forgiving nature, the strategy allows for reconciliation after an opponent's mistake. This fosters a collective mindset as it encourages the continuation of cooperation.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a tone of cooperation and allows for initial stock growth.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's action in the previous round. If they cooperated (C), cooperate as well (C). If they defected (D), also defect in the current round (D). This tit-for-tat approach encourages cooperation but is not overly punishing when met with defection.
   - Modify the basic Tit-for-Tat strategy by considering the stock level. If the remaining stock falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 2n/3 * capacity), always defect to help conserve the resource in critical situations.
   - To be more robust, introduce a forgiveness factor where if the opponent has recently cooperated for several consecutive rounds after a period of defection, they will be given another chance to cooperate without immediate retaliation. The number of forgiven rounds can be set as a parameter.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, defect (D) since there will be no more opportunities for retaliation or forgiveness.
   - If an opponent defects at the beginning of the game and there are no forgiven rounds left, immediately adopt a harsh Tit-for-Tat strategy by always defecting against that opponent from then on.
   - In case the opponent defects during the game but later cooperates for several consecutive rounds, reset the number of forgiven rounds. This allows for continued cooperation and encourages long-term collaboration.

3. Being Collective:
   - Foster a mindset of collective responsibility by striving to maintain a sustainable stock level over time. This ensures that resources are shared fairly among players while promoting collaborative behavior.
   - Periodically evaluate the overall success of the strategy in terms of achieving a high average payoff per round and increasing the common pool resource level. Adjust parameters such as the forgiveness factor or threshold for stock depletion based on performance.

Pseudocode:

```python
def play_game(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  forgiven_rounds = param1  # number of forgiven rounds
  current_opponent_strategy = determine_opponent_strategy(history)

  def decide_action(current_opponent_strategy, last_opponent_action):
    if stock < (2 * n) / 3 * capacity:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round i, player adopts the following decision rule:
     - If previous opponent's action in round i-1 was Cooperate (C), respond with Cooperate (C).
     - If previous opponent's action in round i-1 was Defect (D), respond with Defect (D). This ensures a tit-for-tat approach.
   - However, to account for the unique nature of this game, introduce an additional rule:
     - If the current stock level is less than a threshold T (defined below), always choose Cooperate (C) to help prevent rapid depletion of resources.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: Since there's no history, always start by Cooperating. This can be seen as an act of goodwill or an attempt to establish cooperation.
   - Last round: No specific adjustments are needed since the strategy already accounts for the current stock level in each round.
   - Transition periods: If the stock level drops below T at any point, players will start adopting a more conservative approach and choose Cooperate more often to help recover the resource.

3. Be collective:
   - Encourage cooperative behavior by prioritizing sustainable consumption and preserving resources for future rounds.
   - Respond to opponents' actions based on their recent history, promoting reciprocity while considering the well-being of the common pool.

Pseudocode:
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative-Competitive Algorithm (ACCA) for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round t and for each player i, decide to cooperate or defect based on the current stock S_t, total rounds r, and historical actions of other players (represented by a moving average MA).

   Pseudocode for decision rule:
   ```
   if stock_level <= (capacity / (2 * n)) then
       action = "Defect"  # exploit the resource when it's depleted
   elif stock_level > (capacity / (2 * n)) and moving_average >= threshold then
       action = "Cooperate"  # maintain the resource level if other players are cooperating
   else
       action = "Defect"  # compete for the resource when it's not depleted enough
   ```

   The `threshold` parameter can be determined experimentally based on optimal cooperation levels in various scenarios.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round (t=1), there is no historical data, so set MA to a default value or calculate based on game parameters if needed.
   - In the last round (t=r), prioritize preserving the resource level as it may impact future games.

3. Be Collective:
   - Aim for long-term sustainable cooperation by focusing on maintaining the common pool resource and adapting to opponent behaviors.
   - Periodically adjust the `threshold` parameter based on observed cooperation levels among players in previous rounds, ensuring flexibility and robustness against various strategies.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative-Competitive (ACC) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - The ACC strategy adapts its cooperative and competitive behavior based on the current stock level, history of actions, and the number of players.
   - If the stock level is above 50% of the capacity, the strategy tends to cooperate as there's enough resource for all players. Conversely, if the stock level is below 25% of the capacity, the strategy tends to defect due to fear of depleting the resources.
   - In situations where the stock level is between 25% and 50%, the ACC strategy considers the history of actions in the last five rounds. If the majority of players have cooperated during that period, it chooses to cooperate; otherwise, it defects.

Pseudocode:
```
function get_action(n, stock, history):
    if stock > 0.5 * capacity:

```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, the strategy randomly selects an action to avoid being predictable.
   - In the last round, the ACC strategy evaluates the current stock level and chooses accordingly based on the decision rules mentioned above.

3. Be collective:
   - The ACC strategy prioritizes collective well-being by cooperating when resources are abundant to ensure a stable supply for all players in the long run.
   - When resources are scarce, the strategy competes less aggressively than other strategies that only consider immediate self-interest, thereby contributing to a more sustainable and equitable distribution of resources.

 For this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy called "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat" (ATFT). This strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection while maintaining long-term sustainability of the common resource.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round to show goodwill and establish trust (init_action = C)
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's behavior and adjust actions accordingly:
      - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate as well (ATFT.cooperativeRound())
      - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in response (ATFT.defectiveRound())

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds, cooperate to ensure resource sustainability in that round (last_round = r == 1 ? True : False; if last_round then ATFT.cooperativeRound())
   - In the first round, follow init_action rule as described earlier

3. Be collective:
   - Maintain a history of opponent's actions (history_opponent) and take decisions based on this history to promote fairness, trust, and cooperation
   - Adjust strategies dynamically based on changes in the resource stock level or other game parameters (e.g., if capacity decreases significantly, players might need to defect more often to preserve resources)

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFT():
    init_action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    history_opponent = []

    for t in range(1, r+1):
        if t == 1:
            action = init_action
        else:
            if history_opponent[-1] == 'C':
                action = 'C'  # Cooperate if the opponent cooperated last round
            elif history_opponent[-1] == 'D':
                action = 'D'  # Defect if the opponent defected last round

        if t != r:  # If not the last round, update opponent's action history
            history_opponent.append(action)

        # Perform payoff calculations and stock dynamics here based on actions taken by all players in the current round

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Management Strategy (ASMS)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, calculate the average consumption per player (average_consumption = total_consumption / n).
   - If the remaining stock after consumption is less than 50% of the capacity, adopt a defensive strategy to preserve resources for future rounds. Play D (Defect) if the average consumption per player is greater than the median of historical average consumptions (median_historic_consumption). Otherwise, play C (Cooperate).
   - If the remaining stock after consumption is equal to or more than 50% of the capacity, adopt an offensive strategy to maximize payoff in that round. Play D (Defect) if the average consumption per player is less than the median of historical average consumptions. Otherwise, play C (Cooperate).
   - If it's the first round, players should play C (Cooperate) as there is no history to reference.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, players should consider the remaining stock level and their accumulated payoff over the game. If the stock level is low, play D (Defect) to preserve any remaining resources for future games. If the stock level is high and the player's payoff is below the average payoff of other players, play C (Cooperate) to improve individual performance.
   - In cases where the total consumption after an action results in a negative stock level, set the new stock level to zero to ensure that the stock never goes below zero.

3. Be Collective:
   - ASMS aligns with the collective mindset by promoting long-term resource preservation and encouraging cooperation when it benefits the group as a whole. By adopting a defensive strategy when the remaining stock is less than 50% of the capacity, players are prioritizing the future well-being of the group over immediate individual gains.
   - Additionally, ASMS encourages cooperation in rounds where such action does not jeopardize the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource. This ensures that the collective performance is optimized while maintaining a balance between individual and group interests.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ASMS(current_round, stock, capacity, n, historical_consumptions):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    total_consumption = sum([consumption for player in players])
    average_consumption = total_consumption / n

    if stock <= capacity / 2:
        if average_consumption > median(historical_consumptions):
            return 'D'  # Defect when the average consumption is high
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate when the average consumption is low

    else:
        if stock <= capacity:
            remaining_stock = stock - total_consumption
            growth = 2 * remaining_stock * (1 - remaining_stock / capacity)
            new_stock = min(remaining_stock + growth, capacity)
            if new_stock > capacity / 2:
                if average_consumption < median(historical_consumptions):
                    return 'D'  # Defect when the average consumption is low

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round i, the ATFT player begins by cooperating (C).
   - If in the previous round j, all other players also cooperated (Total_Cooperation_LastRound = n), then continue cooperating.
   - If at least one opponent defected last round (Defectors_LastRound > 0), then defect this round (D).
   - After defection, revert to cooperating if all opponents cooperate in the following round (Total_Cooperation_CurrentRound = n). This reflects forgiveness and willingness to reconcile.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate (C) as a goodwill gesture and to encourage cooperation among other players.
   - Last Round: If stock > 0, cooperate to leave some resources for future games; if stock = 0, defect since there are no more resources available.
   - In case of ties, interpret it as cooperation (since the total consumption will be lower than when all defect).

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize sustainability and long-term cooperation to preserve the common pool resource for future rounds.
   - Respond tit-for-tat to encourage others to cooperate, but also be willing to forgive by revert to cooperating after a previous defection if others cooperate now.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfTGA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and start with a full stock level.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If both players cooperated in the last round, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect.
   - To adapt to different strategies and circumstances, introduce a growth factor G that encourages cooperation when the stock is below the initial capacity and enforces punishment less frequently as the stock depletes.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff by cooperating if the opponent cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, defect to deplete the remaining stock for self-interest.
   - In the initial and subsequent rounds, if the stock is at or near its maximum capacity (above (1 - 1/n) * capacity), play a probability of cooperation P_c based on the growth factor G:
     ```
     if (stock > (1 - 1 / n) * capacity):
         P_c = min(1, max((stock - (1 - 1 / n) * capacity) / capacity, 0))
     else:
         P_c = 0
     ```
   - With probability P_c, cooperate; otherwise, defect.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - By following the TfTGA strategy, players demonstrate reciprocity and trustworthiness while still maintaining a self-interested approach to preserving the common pool resource.
   - The growth factor encourages cooperation early in the game when the stock is more valuable but punishes defection less severely as resources dwindle. This alignment with collective interest promotes long-term sustainability of the resource.

description_COLLECTIVE_466 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peaceful initiation to establish goodwill.
   - For subsequent rounds t (t > 1), assess opponent behavior in previous round t-1. If all opponents cooperated, continue cooperating; if any opponent defected, also defect in this round. This "tit for tat" approach encourages cooperation but is not overly forgiving to repeated defections.
   - Upon encountering a new opponent or after a long period of defection by the opponent, revert back to the initial cooperative move (C).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, choose the action that maximizes the total payoff over all rounds. This may involve cooperating or defecting based on the opponent's behavior in previous rounds.
   - In the first round, if any opponent is unknown (no history), cooperate as a default strategy.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy aligns with a collective mindset by promoting cooperation as long as it persists among all opponents. Defection only occurs in response to defection from other players, encouraging the group to stay together and avoid overexploitation of resources.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C): start with a cooperative gesture to encourage others to do the same.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate opponent's behaviour in the previous round:
     - If the opponent cooperated (C), cooperate as well (repeat cooperation).
     - If the opponent defected (D) and you cooperated in the last round, defect in this round (punish defection).
     - If both you and the opponent defected in the last round, cooperate again (forgive and hope for future cooperation).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, always cooperate since there are no subsequent rounds to consider.
   - If an opponent stops cooperating after a series of mutual cooperation, forgive them and continue with cooperation in the next round.

3. Be collective:
   - Maintain a balance between individual self-interest and communal wellbeing by prioritizing cooperation when possible but also punishing defection to encourage long-term mutual benefit.
   - Align with the collective mindset by adhering to the principle of reciprocity, rewarding cooperation and penalizing defection to promote a cooperative environment among all players.

Pseudocode for ATfT strategy:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (ATFSG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to start with a positive relationship and show good faith. If any player defects in the first round, respond with defection for the remainder of that round.
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if all players cooperated in the previous round or if the ratio of cooperators to total players (cooperation rate) was at least a predefined threshold (e.g., 3/4) in the previous round. Otherwise, defect.
   - If the stock falls below a predefined minimum level (e.g., n), prioritize cooperation to help revive the common pool.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the previous actions as the game ends after that.
   - In the first round and any round where there is a tie in terms of cooperation rate, prefer cooperation to foster a positive relationship with other players.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a balance between self-interest and mutual trust by prioritizing cooperation when it benefits both the individual player and the collective pool in the long run.
   - Respond to defection with defection to deter free riders but quickly revert to cooperation once others return to cooperating to encourage reciprocity.

Pseudocode:

```python

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, the ATFT strategy follows these simple rules:
   - First Round: Cooperate (C) as a gesture of goodwill and to encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - Subsequent Rounds: If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, respond with cooperation. If they defected, defect in the current round. This tit-for-tat approach encourages reciprocation and maintains a balance in resource consumption.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First Round: Cooperate (as mentioned above)
   - Last Round: In the final round, consider the long-term outcome more important than immediate payoffs. Evaluate the average consumption rate throughout the game and respond accordingly to promote a sustainable resource level for future generations.
   - Penalty Phase: If the common pool resource is depleted or nearing depletion (e.g., less than 50% of capacity), switch to always defecting to force opponents to understand the need for conservation. Once the resource starts growing, gradually revert to cooperative behavior.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Collaboration: Prioritize a sustainable consumption rate that maintains the common pool resource for future generations while maximizing individual payoffs in the long run.
   - Responsiveness: Adapt to opponent strategies and adjust the level of cooperation or defection based on observed patterns of behavior, fostering a collaborative environment when possible.
   - Accountability: Maintain a memory of opponent actions and respond accordingly to promote reciprocation and discourage exploitation.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATFT(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, history):
  stock = initial_stock
  opponents_actions = {}  # dictionary to store opponents' past actions (C or D)

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Optimization (ASO) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock level is above the average sustainable stock level per player (average_stock = capacity / n). This encourages conservation to maintain a higher long-term payoff.
   - Defect (D) when the current stock level is below the average sustainable stock level per player. This action allows for rapid growth when resources are scarce but also risks depleting the common pool too quickly.
   - In borderline cases where the stock level is equal to the average sustainable stock level, the strategy will randomly choose either C or D.

Pseudocode:
```
function decide_action(n, S):
  if (S > capacity / n) then return "C"  # Cooperate
  else if (S < capacity / n) then return "D"  # Defect
  else return random("C", "D")  # Randomly choose between C and D
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Since no history is available, the strategy will randomly select an action in the first round.
   - Last Round: The ASO strategy prioritizes maximizing individual payoffs in the final round by defecting regardless of the current stock level. This approach assumes that other strategies may also adopt self-interest tactics towards the end of the game.
   - Transitional Rounds: In rounds where history is available, the strategy will use the accumulated stock depletion to adjust its decision-making process. For example, if previous actions have resulted in low stocks and poor payoffs, the ASO strategy may switch from cooperating to defecting or vice versa in an attempt to improve payoffs.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ASO strategy prioritizes collective sustainability by encouraging cooperation when resources are plentiful but allowing for competition when resources are scarce.
   - By aligning with the average sustainable stock level per player, the ASO strategy attempts to strike a balance between long-term resource conservation and short-term self-interest.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-Based Tit-for-Tat (AFB-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate when the average stock level for the last H rounds (H = round_history_length) is above the median capacity. This encourages cooperation in periods of abundance and discourages it during scarcity.
   - Defect when the average stock level for the last H rounds is below the median capacity. This enforces self-protection when resources are dwindling.
   - In all cases, mimic opponent's actions from the previous round (Tit-for-Tat behavior) to promote trust and discourage exploitation. However, this rule will be overridden by the first two decision rules if they apply.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate due to the potential benefits of fostering a cooperative environment.
   - Last Round: Evaluate the average stock level for the game so far and make a decision based on the decision rule described above.
   - Transition Periods (after significant changes in the average stock level): Adapt H (round_history_length) to account for longer or shorter periods of abundance/scarcity by adjusting it proportionally to the current stock level divided by capacity.

3. Be Collective:
   - Promote cooperation among players by rewarding and reciprocating cooperative behavior, while also being robust against defection.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Threshold (TFTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially cooperate in the first round (stock > 0), setting the initial opponent behavior to 'cooperative'.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate if the opponent's behavior has been 'cooperative' or 'defective' based on the last n rounds. If the number of 'defective' actions by the opponent is less than a predefined adaptive threshold, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - If the stock level falls below a defined minimum (2n/3) after a series of 'defective' actions from the opponent, lower the adaptive threshold to encourage future cooperation. In contrast, if the stock level exceeds the capacity after a sequence of 'cooperative' actions, increase the adaptive threshold to minimize unnecessary contributions.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's behavior, as there are no further rounds for retaliation or reward.
   - If the stock level falls below zero after a series of 'defective' actions from the opponent, switch to a 'defensive' mode by cooperating until the stock recovers above (2n/3) and then resume TFTA strategy.
   - If the stock level reaches or exceeds the capacity after a sequence of 'cooperative' actions, switch to a 'generous' mode by lowering the adaptive threshold, encouraging further cooperation from the opponent.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The TFTA strategy adheres to a collective mindset by fostering cooperation when possible and retaliating only when necessary based on the opponent's behavior in recent rounds.

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to promote trust and cooperation among players. (cooperate(round = 1))
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate other player's behavior by calculating their average cooperative ratio (CR). CR is defined as the number of times a player has cooperated divided by the total number of rounds played with that opponent. If an opponent has cooperated more than half the time (CR > 0.5), then cooperate; otherwise, defect. (cooperate(round, opponent_CR) iff CR > 0.5 else defect)
   - In the last round, since there are no future interactions with opponents, simply maximize personal payoff by defecting against all players regardless of their previous behavior. (defect(round = r))

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This allows the resource to build up and establishes goodwill with other players.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, do so as well; otherwise, defect to match their behavior. This strategy encourages cooperation but also punishes defection.

Pseudocode:

   - If the opponent defects in the first round and there are no remaining rounds, do not retaliate since there will be no further interactions with that player.

3. Be Collective:
   - This strategy aims to foster cooperation by reciprocating kind actions while punishing defection. It encourages players to understand that their actions have consequences and can lead to a sustainable resource for future rounds. The TFT strategy promotes collective mindset as it encourages repeated cooperation among players when they demonstrate trustworthy behavior.
   - By following the simple rule of "imitate my opponent's last action," the strategy helps minimize confusion and encourages a sense of fairness since each player only needs to remember their opponent's previous move to decide on their own. This simplicity allows for easy implementation and understanding across different AI systems, making it more adaptable in a tournament setting.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Forgiveness (TfTAF)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment (C).
   - In subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from the previous round and respond accordingly:
      - If opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate in the current round (C).
      - If opponent defected in the last round, defect in the current round (D). However, introduce an adaptive forgiveness mechanism where after a certain number of defections (F), the strategy will start to forgive opponents by cooperating regardless of their previous actions. The value of F can be adjusted based on the observed behaviour of other strategies.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate as there are no future rounds to consider (C).
   - If an opponent defects after a long period of cooperation, start forgiveness from that point onwards (F). This helps maintain a cooperative environment and avoid unnecessary defections.

3. Being Collective:
   - The strategy aims to promote collective sustainability by mimicking a trusting yet adaptive behaviour. It encourages cooperation when partners demonstrate goodwill but also protects the common pool resource by retaliating against defection with forgiveness as a mechanism for reconciliation and renewed cooperation.
   - The TfTAF strategy does not rely on predetermined norms or coordination mechanisms, making it adaptable to a wide range of opponent behaviours in the tournament.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture, hoping others will follow suit.
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (C). This strategy encourages reciprocation and long-term cooperation.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round. This punishment strategy discourages defection while still allowing for future cooperation if the opponent changes their behavior.
   - In the last round, cooperate (C). Despite the game ending, it is better to end on a cooperative note and potentially foster goodwill for future interactions.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - The strategy assumes no information about the opponents' strategies before the first round. In the first round, cooperation is the default action due to its friendly nature.
   - As the game progresses and more information becomes available, the ATfT strategy adapts accordingly by analyzing the opponents' behaviors and adjusting its own actions.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The ATfT strategy encourages cooperation among players as much as possible by reciprocating friendly gestures and punishing defection. This approach fosters a sense of community and mutual benefit, which are key aspects of a collective mindset.
   - By adapting to the behaviors of other players, the ATfT strategy demonstrates flexibility and responsiveness to the group dynamics. It is designed to maintain cooperative relationships while still being robust against various opponent strategies.

Pseudocode:

```python
def AdaptiveTitForTat(opponent_history):
  my_history = []  # Initialize history of own actions

  def cooperate():
    return "C"

  def defect():
    return "D"

  if round == 1:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round i, decide whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D). The decision is based on the current round number (r), the stock level (S), and historical actions of opponents as follows:
     - If it's the first round, always cooperate (C) to build trust and promote cooperation.
     - If it's the last round or a player has not cooperated in the past rounds, defect (D) as there is no incentive for continued cooperation.
     - In other cases, use the following rule: if all opponents have recently cooperated (in the last 'c' rounds), then cooperate; otherwise, defect. This value 'c' can be adjusted to balance cooperation and defection.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the first round, always cooperate as mentioned above.
   - In the last round, if all opponents have not defected in the past rounds, defect; otherwise, cooperate based on the adaptive decision rule (c value).

3. Being collective:
   - The strategy aims to maintain a sustainable common pool resource while ensuring fairness among players. By cooperating when others do and punishing defection, it promotes trust and long-term cooperation.
   - The ATFT strategy does not require specific coordination mechanisms or norms from other players but adapts to their actions.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Protection (ASP)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, evaluate the current stock level and the minimum historical stock level encountered so far (min_stock).
   - If the current stock is above or equal to the capacity minus twice the number of players, cooperate (C), as the resources are abundant.
   - If the current stock is less than the capacity minus twice the number of players, but it's higher than min_stock, compare the ratio of current stock to minimum historical stock:
      - If this ratio is greater than or equal to a threshold (0.7), defect (D), as the resources are being depleted too rapidly.
      - Otherwise, cooperate (C), as the current resource level is still relatively high compared to the lowest recorded stock.
   - If the current stock equals min_stock, choose the action randomly with equal probability (0.5) to avoid drastic drops in resource levels.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), as there is no historical data available yet.
   - In the last round and when the stock level reaches zero, defect (D), as the game ends anyway.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy prioritizes the long-term sustainability of resources by taking into account both the current state and historical trends.
   - By promoting cooperation when resources are abundant and encouraging conservatism when they're scarce, ASP aims to maintain an equitable distribution of payoffs among players while ensuring the survival of the common pool resource.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish trust and maintain the initial resource level. `if round == 1 then cooperate`
   - After the first round, observe opponents' actions from the previous round and respond accordingly:
     - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (maintain cooperation). `if all(opponents cooperated last round) then cooperate`
     - If any opponent defected in the previous round, defect to penalize the opponent. `if not all(opponents cooperated last round) then defect`
   - This strategy encourages cooperation as long as opponents are cooperative, but retaliates against defection to maintain the resource level.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of opponents' previous actions since there are no future rounds for reciprocation. `if round == r then cooperate`
   - In all other rounds (1 < round < r), follow the adaptive decision rules above.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The strategy promotes cooperation by cooperating when others do and punishing defection to encourage reciprocal behavior, fostering a collective interest in preserving the resource.
   - By adapting to opponents' actions, the strategy exhibits flexibility in addressing various opponent behaviors and encourages collaboration within the group.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This allows for a fresh start and sets a friendly tone for future interactions.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate in the current round; if not, defect. This rule encourages reciprocity and builds trust while also punishing opponents that do not respect the cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round as usual. Since there are no future rounds, this strategy does not impact total game payoff significantly.
   - If faced with a non-cooperative opponent early in the game (e.g., multiple defects), TFT will also adopt a non-cooperative stance to avoid being taken advantage of repeatedly. However, it will quickly revert to cooperation once the opponent shows signs of reciprocation.
   - In case of an unresponsive or inconsistent opponent, TFT will continue cooperating for some number of rounds before retaliating with a single act of defection. This encourages the opponent to resume cooperation while also signaling that the TFT player is not easily exploited.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - TFT prioritizes maintaining the common pool resource and promoting mutual cooperation among players. It aims to build trust and long-term cooperation, which ultimately benefits all players as the stock grows over time.
   - By punishing non-cooperative behavior while rewarding reciprocity, TFT fosters a collective mindset in which all players recognize that their success depends on the group's success. This promotes sustained cooperation and resource preservation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFTA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (initiate with cooperation to promote a peaceful environment).
   - In subsequent rounds, players should mimic their opponents' actions from the previous round. This encourages mutual cooperation and punishes defection.
   - If an opponent has never defected, continue cooperating to maintain trust and reciprocity.
   - If an opponent has defected at least once, players should defect in response to that defection (tit-for-tat). Once the opponent returns to cooperating, players resume cooperation as well.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, players should maximize their payoff by taking the average of potential payoffs for cooperation and defection, choosing the action with a higher expected value. This accounts for the final stock dynamics that influence future rounds' rewards.
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, players cooperate to initiate the game peacefully.
   - If an opponent has never taken any action (e.g., due to a system crash), players should cooperate in the first encounter and mimic their opponents' actions from that point forward.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes the long-term sustainability of the common resource by promoting cooperation as much as possible, while also ensuring fairness through tit-for-tat responses to defection. This approach encourages mutual trust and promotes a collective mindset among players.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFTA(opponent_history, round, r, capacity, n):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
  elif opponent_history[-1] == "C":

  elif opponent_history[-1] == "D" and round != r:
    action = "D"  # Defect in response to defection, except in the last round
  elif round == r:
    if (capacity * n) / (2 * n) > (capacity * (n - 1)) / (2 * (n - 1)):

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to initiate a cooperative relationship.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate if cooperation is beneficial based on the current stock level and the historical average of cooperative actions by all players (Cooperative Index, CI).
     - If CI > Cooperative Threshold (CT) and stock level is above the critical level, cooperate.
     - If CI < CT or stock level is below the critical level, defect to prevent over-exploitation of resources.
   - The CT adjusts dynamically based on the historical average performance (payoff) of cooperation versus defection. A higher payoff for cooperation leads to an increase in the CT, while a higher payoff for defection causes a decrease.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if it results in a better payoff than defecting considering the current stock level and historical average performance.
   - If no cooperation has occurred yet (CI=0), cooperate in the first few rounds to encourage cooperation among players.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - TFT-ACT aims to balance exploitation with cooperation by maintaining a reasonable CT that adapts to the current state and historical trends.
   - This strategy encourages long-term cooperation as it rewards cooperation when it benefits both the player and the collective resource, while penalizing excessive exploitation of resources.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_ACT(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    if round == 1:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate in first round

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate (C). This demonstrates a willingness to share and build trust with other players.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate again; if the opponent defected, also defect in this round. This rule fosters stability by returning cooperation for cooperation and punishment for defection.
   - When the stock reaches zero, start cooperating to rebuild the common pool (only after all players have depleted it). This action is meant to encourage collective recovery and reestablish trust among players.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Mimic the opponent's last action since there will be no subsequent rounds to respond with a counteraction.
   - Tiebreaker (when multiple opponents have the same action history): Cooperate to foster the potential for future cooperation.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes collective resource preservation by mimicking opponent behavior and only exploiting when provoked with defection. This approach aims to maintain long-term cooperation and sustainable stock levels.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATfT(opponent_history, round, r, stock, capacity):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate initially
    else:
        action = opponent_history[-1]  # Mimic the last opponent's action
        if action == 'C':
            if stock <= 0:  # If common pool is depleted, start cooperating to rebuild it
                action = 'C'

    payoff = stock / (2 * len(opponents)) if action == 'C' else stock / len(opponents)
    return action, payoff

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average stock depletion rate (ASDR) over the last 'm' rounds. Calculate ASDR as the total consumption divided by the sum of stocks after consumption in those rounds.
   - If the current player has been cooperating for at least 'c' consecutive rounds and the average stock depletion rate is below a threshold 't', then cooperate (C). Otherwise, defect (D). This encourages cooperation when resources are being managed sustainably but switches to self-interest when overexploitation occurs.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function ATfT(n, r, capacity, stock, round, m, c, t):
       if round == 1:
           action = C if stock > (2n * t) / 3 else D
       else:
           ASDR = total_consumption / sum(stock after consumption for last m rounds)
           if player has cooperated in last c rounds and ASDR < t:
               action = C
           else:
               action = D
   ```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate when there is enough stock to ensure a sustainable growth. This encourages initial cooperation as a cooperative gesture.
   - In the last round, defect regardless of the current state because the game ends in that round.

3. Be Collective:
   - By using ASDR to evaluate the sustainability of resource management, the strategy promotes collective responsibility towards maintaining a sustainable stock level over time.
   - Cooperating when conditions are met encourages cooperation among players and ensures a higher overall payoff for all.

description_COLLECTIVE_485 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Conservation (ASC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the stock level is above the minimum survival threshold (MST). This encourages conservation and fosters cooperation among players to maintain the common pool resource. The MST can be calculated as follows: MST = capacity / n.
   - Defect (D) when the stock level falls below the MST. At this point, the need for individual survival outweighs the collective good, leading players to consume resources more aggressively.
   - In borderline situations where the stock level is close to the MST, players should randomly choose between C and D to mitigate the risk of overexploitation and ensure a higher chance of resource recovery through growth.

2. Edge Cases:
   - First Round (t=1): Players should cooperate as the common pool resource is at its maximum capacity, providing enough resources for everyone while allowing it to grow.
   - Last Round (t=r): Similar to edge cases, but with a slight twist. Since there are no more rounds after this, players should prioritize their own survival over resource conservation and defect if necessary. However, if the stock level is still above MST, they should continue cooperating to maximize personal payoffs.
   - Other Edge Cases (t>1 & t<r): Players should adapt based on the current state of the common pool resource and the calculated MST.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - In every round, players should consider their actions in relation to the collective good, ensuring a sustainable use of the common pool resource for all participants.
   - Players should strive to cooperate whenever possible, as this encourages long-term resource preservation and promotes a mutual understanding that benefits everyone involved.

Pseudocode:
```
function ASC(n, r, capacity, stock, t):
    MST = capacity / n
    if t == 1 or t == r:
        return (stock > MST) ? C : D

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (ATFSG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, the AI will start by cooperating unless the stock is below a threshold (defined as n/2 * capacity). If the stock is below this threshold, the AI will defect to prevent the collapse of the common pool.
   - If the stock is above the threshold, the AI will analyze its opponents' past actions:
     - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, the AI will cooperate.
     - If any opponent defected in the previous round, the AI will defect.
     - If some opponents have cooperated and others have defected in the previous round, the AI will make a decision based on the majority vote: if more than half of the opponents cooperated, the AI will cooperate; otherwise, it will defect.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, all players will cooperate to maximize their initial payoff and grow the common pool for future rounds.
   - In the last round, the AI will cooperate if more than half of the opponents have cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, it will defect to maximize its final payoff.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy encourages cooperation when opponents reciprocate, incentivizing long-term collaboration and sustainable resource management.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATFT strategy promotes a collective mindset by encouraging cooperation and reciprocity, which are essential for sustainable resource management in the game context. It encourages others to collaborate while also being prepared to punish defection. This approach fosters an environment where everyone benefits from mutual cooperation.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation (AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock level is above the average sustainable stock level per player (average_stock = capacity / n). This encourages cooperation when resources are abundant to preserve them for future rounds.
   - Defect (D) if the current stock level is below the average sustainable stock level per player and the total consumption in the previous round was less than or equal to the average consumption per player (average_consumption = capacity / n). This encourages defection when resources are scarce and previous consumption was not excessive.
   - In all other cases, players should randomly choose between C and D, with a slight bias towards cooperation to promote collaborative behavior (51% probability of choosing C).

2. Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Players will randomly choose between C and D, with a slight bias towards cooperation (51% probability of choosing C).
   - Last Round: Players will defect if the current stock level is below the average sustainable stock level per player and total consumption in previous rounds was less than or equal to the average consumption per player. Otherwise, players will choose C based on the decision rules mentioned above.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - Maintain a running average of the stock level (average_stock) and consumption per round (average_consumption).
   - In each round, evaluate the current state using the decision rules described above.
   - The strategy encourages cooperation when resources are abundant but also allows for defection when necessary to preserve the common pool in the long run.

Pseudocode:
```
function AdaptiveCooperation(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  average_stock = capacity / n
  average_consumption = capacity / n
  total_consumption = 0

  if round == 1:
    decide_action_first_round()

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-based Tit-for-Tat (AS-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock level is above a threshold T and more players are cooperating than defecting in the previous round.
   - Defect (D) when any of the following conditions are met:
     a. The current stock level is below the threshold T.
     b. The number of cooperators in the previous round is less than or equal to the number of defectors.
     c. In the first round, AS-TFT will cooperate as a peace offering.

   Pseudocode for decision rules:
   ```
   if (current_stock > T) and (number_of_cooperators > number_of_defectors in previous round):
       action = C
   else:
       action = D
   ```
   The threshold T is a variable that can be adjusted based on the game parameters, initial stock level, and the desired risk tolerance. A lower T encourages more cooperation but exposes AS-TFT to potential exploitation in the beginning of the game or when the common pool resource becomes scarce. Conversely, a higher T promotes self-preservation but may lead to less cooperative behavior and reduced total payoff in the long run.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, AS-TFT will always cooperate (C). This serves as an initial peace offering that might encourage cooperation from other players in subsequent rounds.
   - In the last round or near the end of the game, AS-TFT should switch to a more defensive strategy by lowering T, as there are no further opportunities for reciprocity with other players.

3. Being Collective:
   - AS-TFT is designed to promote cooperation while ensuring self-preservation in the face of defection or scarce resources. By responding cooperatively when others do so and defecting only when necessary, it fosters a collective mindset by encouraging reciprocal behavior and maintaining a balanced distribution of resource consumption.
   - AS-TFT can be further enhanced with additional features like memory to retain information about opponents' strategies and adjust T accordingly, or adaptability to learn from the context or environment in which the game is being played. This would help the strategy achieve better results against various opponent behaviors while still maintaining its core principles of cooperation and self-preservation.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation-Defection (ACD) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the stock level is above the average sustainable level (ASL), defined as `capacity / n`. This encourages cooperation when resources are abundant, fostering a collective mindset.
   - Defect (D) when the stock level drops below ASL or is equal to it and there's a history of defection from other players in the previous round(s). The strategy adapts to the behavior of opponents and discourages defection when resources are scarce, promoting cooperation.

Pseudocode for decision rules:
```
function get_decision(n, stock, history):
    if stock > capacity / n:
        return "C" # Cooperate
    else:
        if len(history) == 0: # First round
            return random_choice("C", "D")
        else:
            if all(defect in history[-1] for player in range(1, n+1)): # Last round with everyone defecting
                return "D"
            else:
                return "C" if stock >= capacity / n - (capacity / n) * len(history[-1]) else "D"
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, a random choice between cooperation and defection is made to break symmetry and initiate play.
   - In the last round, if all players have defected in the previous round, the strategy will defect as well since there are no more rounds to recover from the depletion of resources.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ACD strategy encourages cooperation when resources are abundant (above the average sustainable level) and discourages defection when resources are scarce (below or equal to ASL) and there's a history of defection from other players in the previous round(s). This fosters a collective mindset by promoting cooperation when it benefits the group while ensuring that defections do not deplete resources unsustainably.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) with Stock Growth Consideration (SG-ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Start by Cooperating to demonstrate goodwill and build trust. This encourages other players to cooperate as well, maximizing the initial stock growth.
     - Pseudocode: if t = 1 then action = 'C'

   - Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):
      - If all players cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating to reinforce trust and maintain the growing stock level.
        - Pseudocode: if last_round_action_sum == (n * 'C') then action = 'C'

      - If any player defected in the previous round, defect in response to punish the defector while also considering the stock growth. If the stock is near capacity or close to extinction, cooperate to prevent disaster or maximize growth respectively.
        - Pseudocode: if last_round_action_sum != (n * 'C') then:
                - If stock < capacity / n and last_round_action_sum > n/2 then action = 'D'
                - Else if stock >= capacity*(1-1/n) then action = 'C'
                - Otherwise, choose a random action ('C' or 'D') with higher probability towards cooperation to maintain trust.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Since the game ends after r rounds, there will be no future interactions and punishing others may not benefit. Cooperate in the last round to maximize payoff.
     - Pseudocode: if t = r then action = 'C'

3. Be Collective:
   - Prioritize collective growth by considering the stock level when deciding whether to cooperate or defect, promoting sustainable usage of resources and encouraging cooperation among players.

In this strategy, SG-ATFT maintains a balance between cooperation and defection while taking into account both short-term (punishing defectors) and long-term (stock growth) considerations. This adaptive approach is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors and promote collective mindset.

description_COLLECTIVE_493 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round i, player follows a cooperative approach by choosing action C unless provoked. If any player defected in the previous round (t-1), the current player will also defect (punish). If all players cooperated in the previous round, the current player will also cooperate (reward).
   - To reduce the chances of overexploitation and ensure some degree of cooperation, the strategy introduces a forgiveness mechanism. After encountering defector(s) consecutively for a certain number of times (let's call it F), the strategy starts to forgive these defectors by choosing C again even if they defected in the most recent round.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, players start cooperative and forgiving, with F set initially to the maximum number of rounds (r).
   - In the last round, players will not need to adapt their strategy because there are no subsequent rounds. However, they should still consider the collective mindset by continuing to cooperate if all other players cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, defect if any player defected.

3. Being Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy aims to promote and preserve cooperation while also being robust against defectors. It encourages cooperation by rewarding good behavior (cooperation) and punishing bad behavior (defection).
   - The forgiveness mechanism allows for the possibility of reconciliation among players, fostering a more cooperative environment in the long run.

Pseudocode:
```
def ATFT(player_id, n, r, capacity, stock, round, history):
  if round == 1 or round == r:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first and last rounds
  else:
    def F: player_id.F  # Initial F is set to r
    if history[player_id - 1][round - 1] == 'C':  # Cooperators rewarded
      action = 'C'
    elif history[player_id - 1][round - 1] == 'D' and player_id in recentDefectors(history, round - F):  # Punish repeat defectors with F forgiveness period
      action = 'D'
    else:                                          # Forgive once and cooperate again
      action = 'C'
      F -= 1

function recentDefectors(history, round):
  # Identify players that have recently defected (in the past F rounds)
```
This strategy encourages cooperation while also being adaptive to a wide range of opponent behaviors. The forgiveness mechanism helps maintain cooperation over time and prevents premature punishment or overexploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_494 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-Based Tit-for-Tat (AS-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock level is above a threshold T_cooperate, defined by the initial capacity and number of players: T_cooperate = capacity / (2n). This encourages cooperation when resources are plentiful to benefit from the growth mechanism.
   - Defect (D) when the current stock level is below or equal to T_defect, calculated as the minimum between the initial capacity and twice the number of players: T_defect = min(capacity, 2n). This promotes defection when resources are scarce or heavily depleted.
   - In all other cases, players will cooperate to encourage resource growth in accordance with the Tit-for-Tat (TFT) strategy. Mimic the opponent's previous action unless the opponent acted selfishly (defected) in the last two rounds, in which case defect to teach them a lesson and encourage future cooperation.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the first round, players will cooperate as there is no information about the opponent's past actions.
   - In the last round, players will evaluate the current stock level to decide their action according to T_cooperate and T_defect thresholds. If the current stock level permits cooperation, players will cooperate; otherwise, they will defect.

3. Being collective:
   - This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by encouraging cooperation when resources are plentiful (to benefit from the growth mechanism) and promoting defection when resources are scarce or heavily depleted. The TFT-like behavior maintains trust in others and responds to selfish actions by mimicking them for a short period before returning to cooperative behavior, fostering long-term cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```python
def AS_TFT(n, r, capacity, current_stock, past_actions=[]):
    T_cooperate = capacity / (2 * n)
    T_defect = min(capacity, 2 * n)

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) if the current stock level is above the average sustainable stock level (average capacity / n). This encourages conservation and cooperation when resources are plentiful.
   - Defect (D) if the current stock level is below the average sustainable stock level. This ensures survival during scarcity by taking a larger share of the available resources.
   - In case of a tie, players will cooperate to avoid further depletion of resources and promote recovery.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, all players cooperate since the stock level is at its maximum (capacity).
   - In the last round or when the stock level reaches zero, players defect to maximize their payoff since there will be no growth in the subsequent round.

3. Be collective:
   - Players will remember and respond to their opponents' previous actions based on a forgiveness factor (γ). If an opponent cooperated in the last encounter, the player will cooperate for γ rounds in return. Otherwise, the player will defect until the opponent cooperates again. This strategy promotes cooperation while also punishing defection.
   - Players can set a default forgiveness factor γ to start with and adjust it based on the overall performance of their opponents throughout the game.

Pseudocode:

```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to start with a positive relationship and foster trust among players.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponents' actions from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated in the last round (C), cooperate as well; if they defected (D), also defect. This strategy promotes mutual cooperation when it exists but punishes defection to discourage free riding.
   - If an opponent switches from cooperation to defection, the ATFT strategy will continue to cooperate for a predefined number of rounds before retaliating with defection. This "forgiveness period" encourages opponents to reconsider their behavior and potentially return to cooperation.
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize potential payoff.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C).
   - If the opponent defected in the last round and it is not the last round, defect for the current round but revert to cooperation on the next round if the opponent switches back to cooperation. This maintains the "forgiveness period" even after a single act of defection.
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) regardless of the opponent's previous action.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy fosters collective mindset by promoting mutual cooperation and punishing defection to create an environment that benefits all players in the long run.

Pseudocode:

```
def AdaptiveTitForTat(opponent_history, round_number, forgiveness_period):
    if round_number == 1:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round_number == r:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate in the last round
    else:
        action = opponent_history[-1]  # Mimic opponent's action from the previous round

    if round_number > 2 and action == "D" and len(opponent_history) > forgiveness_period + 1 and \
       opponent_history[-forgiveness_period - 1] == "C":
        action = "C"  # Cooperate after the defined forgiveness period if opponent defected in the last round

    return action

The strategy can be fine-tuned by adjusting the `forgiveness_period` variable to balance cooperation and punishment based on specific opponent behaviors and game parameters.

 For this Common Pool Resource Game, we will develop a strategy named Tit-for-Tat-Growing (TfT-Growing). The strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection while maintaining sustainability in resource management.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) if the average consumption per player is below the sustainable level for two consecutive rounds.
   - Defect (D) if the average consumption per player exceeds the sustainable level for two consecutive rounds.
   - In all other cases, use the Tit-for-Tat strategy:
     - If opponent cooperates in the previous round, return cooperation.
     - If opponent defects in the previous round, return defection.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: Cooperate (as there is no history to analyze)
   - Last round: Cooperate if average consumption per player is below the sustainable level; Defect otherwise (to minimize depletion of resources for future games)

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize long-term sustainability and fair distribution of resources over short-term gain, as this approach aligns with a collective mindset that values cooperation and resource conservation.

Pseudocode:
```
function TfT_Growing(n, r, capacity, stock, round, history):
  if round == 1:
    return C

  average_consumption = sum(history[-r+1:-1]) / (r-1)

  if average_consumption > capacity / 2n or average_consumption < capacity / 4n:
    return D

  if round == r:
    if average_consumption > capacity / 2n:
      return D

  previous_action = history[-1]
  if previous_action == C and average_consumption < capacity / (2n):
    return C
  elif previous_action == D and average_consumption >= capacity / (2n):
    return D

  return previous_action
```
The TfT-Growing strategy emphasizes the importance of cooperation and resource conservation while being adaptive to various opponent behaviors. It aims for a balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability, aligning with a collective mindset in the game.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to establish goodwill and foster cooperation potential among players.
   - In subsequent rounds, base your action on the previous player's action from the most recent round:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate as well. This reciprocates their cooperation and encourages further collaborative behavior.
     - If the opponent defected in the last round, also defect this time to demonstrate that such actions are not without consequences but leave room for future cooperation if the opponent changes their strategy.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize individual payoff (since the game ends after this round).
   - For the first round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate to initiate a positive dynamic in the game.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy is collectively-minded as it seeks long-term cooperation by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defection only when necessary. This encourages players to work together for mutual benefit.

Pseudocode:
```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if (round == 1):
    return "C" # Cooperate in the first round
  last_round = previous_action[round - 1] # Store opponent's action from last round

  if (last_round == "C"):
    return "C" # Reciprocate cooperation
  else:

      return "D" # Punish defection from the most recent round
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_499 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (Round 1): Cooperate (C), setting a cooperative tone and demonstrating trust to other players. This encourages reciprocity in future rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds:
     a) If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate by cooperating again (C). This reinforces mutual cooperation.
     b) If the opponent defected in the previous round, also defect this round (D). This is a punishing action meant to encourage future cooperation from the opponent.

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: If the total stock is depleted and the game continues into another round, ATFT will continue with the last observed behavior of opponents in the last non-depleted round (i.e., cooperate or defect). This is to avoid contributing to further resource depletion in the last round.
   - Initial Stock Reached Zero: In case the initial stock is zero, follow the rule for Round 1 and start by cooperating (C) as a demonstration of trust.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - ATFT aims to maintain a stable resource level over time while promoting cooperation among players. By adhering to the Tit-for-Tat strategy, it fosters reciprocity and minimizes conflict. This collective mindset focuses on building long-term relationships with other strategies in the tournament.

Pseudocode:

```
function ATFT(round, opponent_action_history, stock) {
  if (round == 1) {
    return 'C' // Cooperate in the first round
  } else if (opponent_action_history[round-1] == 'C') {

    return 'D' // Punish defection
  }
}
```

description_COLLECTIVE_500 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Conservation (ASC) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock level is above the critical point Cp and defect (D) otherwise. The critical point Cp is determined adaptively based on the history of the game as follows:
     - If the total consumption in the previous round was less than or equal to the sustainable consumption (i.e., 2n), then Cp remains unchanged.
     - Otherwise, if the total consumption exceeded the sustainable consumption, Cp increases linearly with the excess consumption and up to a maximum of capacity/n.
     - In the first round, Cp is set to capacity/(2n).

Pseudocode for calculating Cp:
```
function calculate_Cp(history):
  if history.empty():
    return capacity / (2 * n)
  last_round = history[-1]
  total_consumption = sum(last_round.total_consumption)
  if total_consumption <= 2*n:
    return Cp
  else:
    excess_consumption = total_consumption - 2 * n
    new_Cp = min(capacity / n, Cp + (excess_consumption / (r - 1)))
    Cp = new_Cp
  return Cp
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, all players play C as Cp is set to capacity/(2n).
   - In the last round, players will base their decision on the current stock level and Cp.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy aims at maintaining a sustainable common pool for future rounds by considering both the total consumption and the remaining stock growth in each round.
   - The adaptive nature of ASC allows it to adjust its behavior based on the opponents' strategies, fostering a collective mindset of resource conservation over exploitation.

The strategy can be seen as an iterative adaptation mechanism that encourages players to cooperate when the common pool is sufficiently stocked and defect otherwise, with the critical point serving as a threshold for cooperation. The ASC strategy aims at striking a balance between immediate gain and long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, the ATFT strategy cooperates (C) if the opponent cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, it defects (D). This simple rule encourages reciprocity while also being forgiving of occasional defections.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, both players are encountering each other for the first time, so they will cooperate (C) as a friendly gesture. In the last round and any case where one or more players have no incentive to continue playing (i.e., stock reaches zero), the strategy follows the same rules.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   The ATFT strategy aims to promote cooperation by reciprocating kindness and punishing defection, hoping that the collective behavior will lead to sustainable resource management over multiple rounds. As long as the players continue playing, they have an incentive to cooperate, preserving the common pool resources for future rounds.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(opponent_action_history):
  if |opponent_action_history| == 0:

   - Subsequent Rounds (t>1): Observe opponents' actions in the previous round, cooperating if all opponents cooperated in the last round, and defecting if any opponent defected or if the game is at the end (last round). If less than half of the opponents cooperated but not the last round, repeat the action of the previous round. If the number of cooperators in the previous round increased compared to the last time the number was lower than half, then also cooperate; otherwise defect.

    else:
      return 'D'

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First Round (t=1): Cooperate to demonstrate a willingness for cooperation and allow the stock to grow as much as possible.
   - Last Round (t=r): If there are not enough cooperators to maximize the payoff for all players in the last round, defect to secure the maximum individual gain. Otherwise, follow the decision rule as described earlier.
   - Other Edge Cases: In between the first and last rounds, the strategy follows the general decision rules.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The SG-ATFT aims to balance cooperation and defection based on other players' actions while maintaining a focus on the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource (stock). This approach is designed to promote collective growth, as well as punish defections when necessary. However, it also prioritizes individual payoff maximization in the last round if cooperation among players fails to secure a sustainable stock level for all.

     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) to punish them for depleting the common resource excessively.
     - If there's no prior interaction (first encounter with an opponent), cooperate (C).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Since the objective is long-term survival of the common pool, the strategy will prioritize cooperation even if the opponent defected in the previous round.
   - First Encounter: As mentioned earlier, cooperate to show goodwill and start with a full stock level.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy is designed to promote cooperation within the group while also ensuring that excessive depletion of the common resource by defectors is met with appropriate punishment in subsequent interactions. By doing so, it aims to foster a collective mindset where all players understand the importance of sustainable resource management for mutual benefit.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(opponent_history, round, capacity, n):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C' (Cooperate)

  opponent_action = opponent_history[-1]

  if opponent_action == 'D':
    if round == r:
      return 'C' (Cooperate)  // Last round, prioritize cooperation
    else:
      return 'D' (Defect)     // Punish defector for excessive resource depletion
  else:
    return 'C' (Cooperate)   // Cooperate if opponent cooperated in the previous round
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (first round), cooperate (C). This is a peaceful gesture to establish trust and set the foundation for future cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's action from the previous round: if they cooperated (C) in the last round, cooperate; otherwise, defect (D). This strategy balances reciprocity and punishes defection while maintaining the possibility of forgiveness.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - Last round: adapt to the opponent's last action. If they have been cooperative throughout the game, continue cooperation; otherwise, defect. This approach rewards good behavior and punishes bad behavior even in the final round.
   - If the game has an odd number of rounds (r is an integer), treat the middle round as a special case: if the stock is near depletion, defect to ensure survival, while maintaining reciprocity in other rounds.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The ATfT strategy encourages cooperation by fostering trust and reciprocity among players. It also incentivizes good behavior as players who cooperate will generally receive better payoffs over time.
   - Additionally, ATfT can help establish a stable equilibrium in which all players follow the same decision rules, promoting collective stability and higher average payoffs compared to other strategies that rely on repeated defection.

Pseudocode:

```python
def Adaptive_Tit_for_Tat(opponent_history, round_number, n, capacity):
  if round_number == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

  if len(opponent_history) > 0:
    last_action = opponent_history[-1]
    if last_action == 'C':
      return 'C'  # If opponent cooperated, cooperate back
    else:
      return 'D'  # If opponent defected, defect in response

  # Handle edge case for the middle round when depletion is near
  if (round_number == r // 2) and (stock < capacity - n):
    return 'D'  # Defect to ensure survival

  # In all other cases, continue cooperation
  return 'C'
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) with Stock Buffer and Gradient Learning

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, calculate the average consumption per player over the last 'history_size' rounds. If this average is below a threshold, cooperate (C), otherwise defect (D). The threshold is set to be slightly lower than the ideal consumption rate for maximum collective payoff (2/(2n)).
   - Maintain a stock buffer that adjusts based on the difference between total consumption and ideal consumption over the last 'history_size' rounds. If the buffer is positive, cooperate; if negative or zero, defect. The buffer decreases when players consume less than ideal amounts (cooperate), and increases when they consume more than ideal amounts (defect).
   - Use gradient learning to adjust the buffer over time. In each round, update the buffer by a small fraction of the difference between the current buffer value and the ideal buffer value, which is defined as the difference between the average consumption per player over the last 'history_size' rounds and 2/(2n).

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Defect (D) to ensure individual survival and start building the stock buffer.
   - Last Round: Cooperate (C) if the average consumption per player over the last 'history_size' rounds is below the threshold, or defect if it's above. In this case, there will be no need for a buffer adjustment since the game ends after this round.

3. Being Collective:
   - The strategy aims to maintain a sustainable stock level that benefits all players in the long run by promoting cooperation when others are cooperating and punishing defection when others are not. This aligns with a collective mindset of fair resource distribution while ensuring individual survival and growth over time.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFT(n, r, capacity, history_size):
    stock = capacity  # Initialize stock to maximum sustainable level
    buffer = 0         # Initialize buffer to zero
    ideal_buffer = 2 / (2 * n)   # Ideal consumption rate for maximum collective payoff

    for round in range(1, r + 1):
        avg_consumption = calculate_avg_consumption(history_size)  # Calculate average consumption over the last 'history_size' rounds
        if avg_consumption < ideal_consumption:   # Cooperate if average consumption is below the threshold
            action = "C"
            update_buffer(buffer, ideal_buffer, avg_consumption)  # Adjust buffer based on gradient learning

            action = "D"
            update_buffer(buffer, ideal_buffer, avg_consumption)  # Adjust buffer based on gradient learning

        stock -= total_consumption          # Update stock after all players consume
        growth = 2 * stock * (1 - stock / capacity)   # Calculate growth in stock
        new_stock = min(stock + growth, capacity)    # Update new stock level
        update_history(round, action, total_consumption)  # Save round data for future reference

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) with Stock Dynamics Awareness (SDA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peaceful initiation and allows for potential cooperation in future rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the actions of opponents in the previous round and adjust your action accordingly:
     - If all opponents cooperated, cooperate (C) again, encouraging long-term collaboration.
     - If any opponent defected, defect (D) in response to ensure fairness and encourage future cooperation.
   - The strategy is adaptive, allowing it to retaliate against defection while maintaining the possibility of forgiveness for occasional mistakes or deviations from cooperation.

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Since payoffs are cumulative over all rounds, there's no need to adjust behavior in the last round as it won't affect the total game payoff. Follow the decision rules described above.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATfT with SDA strategy emphasizes mutual cooperation and reciprocity among players. It promotes a collective mindset by discouraging free-riding and fostering long-term collaboration, as it retaliates against defection but also forgives occasional mistakes.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-AC starts by cooperating in the first round, mimicking a trustful initial approach. In subsequent rounds, it will adopt the previous opponent's strategy from the previous round for that specific game instance (tit-for-tat behavior). If the opponent switches strategies during the game, TFT-AC maintains its current response to provide some level of stability and predictability. To encourage cooperation, TFT-AC gradually increases its willingness to cooperate if the game's average stock level is above a specific threshold (80% of the initial capacity). Conversely, it reduces its willingness to cooperate when the average stock level falls below this threshold.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   strategy = COOPERATE  # Initialize strategy as cooperation
   avgStockLevel = initial_stock
   opponentHistory = []

   def nextMove(opponentLastAction, currentStock):
       if currentRound == 1:
           return COOPERATE  # Cooperate in the first round
       else:
           opponentHistory.append(opponentLastAction)
           if len(opponentHistory) > r/2 and averageStockLevel >= 0.8 * initial_stock:
               strategy = COOPERATE  # Increase cooperation when stock is high
           elif len(opponentHistory) > r/2 and averageStockLevel < 0.8 * initial_stock:
               strategy = DEFECT  # Decrease cooperation when stock is low
           return opponentHistory[-1]  # Adopt the opponent's last strategy
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   TFT-AC remains consistent with its tit-for-tat approach for all rounds, including the first and last ones. However, it starts by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative relationship with opponents if they follow suit. In the last round, it will mimic the opponent's strategy from the previous round (tit-for-tat behavior).

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   TFT-AC is designed to be collectively beneficial in repeated games where players tend to cooperate and maintain a stable common pool resource level. By adapting its cooperation based on the game's average stock level, it encourages long-term cooperation while ensuring that it does not overexploit the resource when the opponents are being selfish or uncooperative. This strategy promotes the collective goal of maintaining a sustainable common pool resource for all players.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules (Cooperate vs Defect): The Tit-for-Tat strategy is designed to encourage cooperation in the first instance and retaliate against defection with defection, but quickly return to cooperation thereafter. This approach promotes a balance between individual interest and collective benefit while being adaptive to various opponent behaviors.

   - If previous round's action by player i was Cooperation (C), play C.
   - If previous round's action by player i was Defection (D), play D.

2. Handle Edge Cases:

   - First Round: Play C, demonstrating an initial willingness to cooperate.
   - Last Round: Due to the repeated nature of the game and the possibility of future interactions, it is best to maintain the Tit-for-Tat strategy even in the last round.
   - Stock Levels: In case the stock reaches or falls below 0, the strategy should still follow the decision rules, understanding that the new stock will be calculated based on the remaining stock and growth factor (as described in the game structure).

3. Be Collective: The Tit-for-Tat strategy aligns with a collective mindset by promoting cooperation when others do so and retaliating against defection to encourage return to cooperation. This approach aims for a balanced outcome that benefits both individual players and the common pool resource over time.

Pseudocode:
```
function TitForTatStrategy(player_id, previous_action, stock, n, r):
  if round = 1:
    return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

  if previous_action == "C":
    return "C"  # Cooperate when others cooperate
  else:
    return "D"  # Defect when others defect

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-Oriented Stock Management (AFSM)

1. Specify decision rules:
   AFSM makes decisions based on the current state of the stock and its growth potential. The aim is to maximize long-term payoffs while ensuring the sustainability of the common pool resource.

   - Cooperate (C) when the stock is below the average sustainable level per player (n * capacity / n) and the growth potential is high, indicating that the current consumption will not deplete the stock significantly and promote recovery in subsequent rounds.

   - Defect (D) when the stock is above the average sustainable level per player or the growth potential is low, indicating that cooperation may lead to overconsumption and further depletion of the resource.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: AFSM cooperates to build up the initial stock level and promote growth.
   - Last round: AFSM considers the current state of the stock and its potential for recovery in the final rounds, but prioritizes cooperation if the resource is not critically depleted to ensure long-term sustainability.
   - Intermediate rounds: AFSM assesses the current state of the stock and growth potential, and makes decisions accordingly as described above.

3. Be collective:
   Although AFSM does not rely on others sharing norms or coordination mechanisms, it prioritizes cooperation to promote the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource, which aligns with a collective mindset. By doing so, AFSM hopes to encourage other strategies to cooperate as well, leading to more sustainable outcomes for all players.

Pseudocode:
```
function AFSM(n, r, capacity, stock, round) {
  average_sustainable_stock = n * capacity / n;
  growth_potential = 2 * stock * (1 - stock/capacity);

  if round == 1 || (stock < average_sustainable_stock && growth_potential > 0) {
    return "C"; // Cooperate
  } else if (stock >= average_sustainable_stock || growth_potential <= 0) {
    return "D"; // Defect
  }

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Quotient (TFT-ACQ)

1. Decision rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round (C1). This sets a positive tone and encourages potential partners for long-term collaboration.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe opponent's action from the previous round (OppRound-1). If they also cooperated (OppC1), continue cooperating (TC). If they defected (OppD1), defect in response (TD). This aims to mimic a trustworthy partner while retaliating against exploitative opponents.
   - In general rounds, calculate the Cooperative Quotient (CQ) as the average number of consecutive cooperations from the opponent since the last defection or first round. If CQ > 0.5, cooperate (TC). Otherwise, defect (TD). This adaptive approach rewards consistent cooperation while allowing for swift retaliation against opponents who repeatedly defect.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, there is no OppRound-1, so revert to simple TFT strategy by mirroring the opponent's action from the second-to-last round (OppT2). If they cooperated (OppTC2), continue cooperating. If they defected (OppTD2), also defect. This ensures fairness in the final round, regardless of previous actions.
   - In case of a tie in the Cooperative Quotient calculation, default to cooperation as a peaceful resolution.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy emphasizes long-term sustainability and mutual trust by cooperating when possible while maintaining a strong stance against exploitation. This promotes cooperation among players who also value fairness and sustainability in their strategies.

Pseudocode for TFT-ACQ Strategy:

```python
def play_game(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    cooperative_quotient = 0
    history = [C1]  # Initializing strategy history with cooperation in the first round

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build trust and avoid overexploitation of the common pool resource. If other players cooperate, continue cooperation; if not, respond with defection in the hope they will change their behavior.
   - For subsequent rounds, closely monitor the previous actions of each opponent (cooperate or defect). If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate with cooperation. If an opponent defected, also defect to match their behavior in the hope that they will switch back to cooperation when they realize the negative consequences of overexploitation.
   - To avoid rapid cycles of cooperation and defection that could deplete the common pool too quickly, consider a gradual response to opponent actions by adjusting the probability of cooperating based on the average history of their behavior (average between 10 most recent rounds). If an opponent's average behavior is primarily cooperation, increase the probability of cooperating. Conversely, if an opponent's average behavior is primarily defection, decrease the probability of cooperating.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, as there are no further rounds to consider, adopt a forgiving approach by cooperating even with opponents who have been predominantly defecting throughout the game. This allows for the possibility of building trust and encouraging cooperation in future interactions.
   - In the first round, since there is no history to analyze, default to cooperating as described above.
   - If an opponent consistently defects while others are cooperating, consider adjusting the response strategy by targeting the frequent defector with a lower probability of cooperation, aiming to punish their behavior and encourage a shift toward cooperation.

3. Be Collective:
   - Prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term gains by prioritizing cooperation when possible. This not only preserves the common pool resource but also promotes collaboration among players and contributes to collective well-being.
   - Encourage other players to adopt similar strategies by modeling cooperative behavior and signaling a commitment to long-term collaboration over short-term self-interest.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFTSA(history, r, n, capacity):
  average_cooperation = calculateAverageCooperation(history)
  probability_cooperate = 0.6 + 0.4 * average_cooperation  # adjust prob based on avg coop history (0.6 is base cooperation rate)

  if round == 1:
    probability_cooperate = 1.0  # default to cooperating in the first round
  elif round == r:
    probability_cooperate = 1.0  # forgive opponents in the last round

  action = chooseAction(probability_cooperate)  # return 'C' for Cooperate, 'D' for Defect

  return action
```

The strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection based on historical data while maintaining a commitment to long-term sustainability and collective well-being. This adaptive approach should perform well against various opponent behaviors and contribute positively to the tournament outcomes.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Evolution (TFT-E)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), setting a positive initial tone for collaboration.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's actions from the previous round: if opponent cooperated (C), also cooperate (C); if opponent defected (D), also defect (D). This builds trust and encourages reciprocity.
   - If an opponent switches from cooperation to defection, the TFT-E strategy will continue to cooperate for a predefined number of rounds (punishment period) before reverting back to mimicking the opponent's actions. The punishment period length can be adjusted based on the observed opponent behavior and game parameters.
   - In the final round, if both players have cooperated consistently throughout the game, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect to maximize payoff in the last chance.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First round: Cooperate (C) regardless of the opponent's actions or past history as no previous information is available.
   - Last round: If both players have cooperated consistently throughout the game, continue cooperating to build a positive final impression. Otherwise, defect (D) to maximize payoff in the last chance.
   - In-between rounds: Mimic opponent's actions from the previous round and apply the punishment period logic when necessary.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - TFT-E is designed to encourage cooperation and reciprocity, fostering a collective mindset by rewarding mutual trust and punishing defection with a temporary delay.
   - By being adaptive and robust to various opponent behaviors, TFT-E demonstrates that long-term success can be achieved through collaboration rather than relentless self-interest.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_513 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, players cooperate (C). This allows for the opportunity to build up a shared stock and establish trust among players.
   - For subsequent rounds, players will imitate the actions of their opponents from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated in the last round, the player also cooperates; if not, the player defects.
   - To account for potential differences in stock levels and to incentivize cooperation when the stock is high, players will evaluate their actions based on a modified payoff function that considers both the stock level and the opponent's previous action. The modified payoff function is as follows:
     - If the stock level is greater than or equal to a threshold (T), and the opponent cooperated in the last round, the player cooperates for a higher payoff (π_i = S/(2n) + B); if not, the player defects for a lower payoff (π_i = S/n - P).
     - If the stock level is less than T and the opponent cooperated in the last round, the player still cooperates but with a slightly lower payoff (π_i = S/(2n) - A); if not, the player defects for a slightly reduced payoff (π_i = S/n - C).
     - The parameters B, P, A, and C can be adjusted to fine-tune the strategy's responsiveness to different stock levels and opponent behaviors.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, players will cooperate regardless of their opponent's previous action as there is no more opportunity for future interaction or retaliation.
   - If a player encounters an opponent who always defects (Defect-All), they will also consistently defect to avoid being exploited. Conversely, if a player encounters an opponent who always cooperates (Cooperate-Always), they will cooperate to maximize their own payoff.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy emphasizes cooperation as its primary principle but is adaptive enough to respond to different opponent behaviors. By adjusting the parameters B, P, A, and C, the strategy can be fine-tuned to better align with various collective norms or expectations in a given context.
   - The strategy encourages long-term collaboration by cooperating when the stock is high (to promote growth) and responding defensively when the stock is low (to prevent depletion).
   - By considering both current actions and accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds, the strategy ensures that it learns from its past experiences and adapts accordingly.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adjustment (TfTA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - TfTA always cooperates in the first round to establish a peaceful initial state.
   - In subsequent rounds, TfTA responds to opponents' previous actions:
     - If opponent cooperated, TfTA cooperates back to maintain cooperation and ensure a healthy stock level.
     - If opponent defected, TfTA also defects as retaliation against the overconsumption, but adjusts its consumption to prevent rapid stock depletion. Specifically, TfTA consumes:
       - stock/(2n) if opponents' previous total consumption is below a certain threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity).
       - stock/n if opponents' previous total consumption is above the threshold.
     - This mechanism encourages cooperation when opponents cooperate and punishes overconsumption, while still maintaining some flexibility to adapt to various opponent behaviors.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, TfTA always cooperates regardless of its opponents' previous actions, as there is no future interaction to consider.
   - If an opponent does not follow the rules of the game (e.g., consuming more than stock/n), TfTA considers such behavior as defect and adjusts its consumption accordingly, ensuring a minimal sustainable stock level.

3. Be collective:
   - TfTA aims to maintain a fair and balanced stock level for all players by responding to opponents' actions while preserving cooperation when possible.
   - By following this strategy, TfTA contributes to the overall well-being of the group, promoting long-term sustainability and mutual benefit.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to build trust and demonstrate a cooperative stance (C).
   - Subsequent rounds: If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C). If opponent defected in the previous round, also defect in this round (D). This encourages cooperation while punishing defection.
   - Modify the original Tit-for-Tat strategy by considering stock dynamics. If current stock is below 50% of capacity, always defect to prevent overexploitation and preserve resources for future rounds.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if the common pool is depleted (stock = 0), defect since there will be no future rounds. If there is still stock, follow decision rules as described above.
   - In the first round, cooperate as stated earlier.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy aims to foster cooperation while ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource. It rewards cooperation and punishes defection but is flexible enough to adapt to opponents who may switch between cooperation and defection.

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In every round t, starting from the first round (t=1), the ATFT strategy follows these rules:
   - If in the previous round (t-1), all opponents cooperated (C), cooperate (C).
   - If in the previous round (t-1), at least one opponent defected (D), defect (D).
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) as a gesture of goodwill.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   The strategy does not distinguish between the first and any other initial rounds. It also doesn't have special behavior for the last round since the game is repeatedly played for multiple rounds (r > 1).

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   ATFT aims to promote cooperation by punishing defection with similar actions in the following round and rewarding cooperation with continued cooperation. This encourages a stable equilibrium of mutual cooperation, as long as opponents also adopt cooperative strategies that are forgiving enough to allow for occasional mistakes.

Pseudocode:

```
function ATFT(previous_rounds):
    if len(previous_rounds) == 0:
        # First round, cooperate unconditionally
        return 'C'

    last_round = previous_rounds[-1]

    if all(last_round['action'] == 'C'):
        # If all opponents cooperated in the last round, cooperate this round
        return 'C'
    else:
        # If at least one opponent defected in the last round, defect this round
        return 'D'
```

description_COLLECTIVE_517 = '''
 In this strategic game, we'll design a Tit-for-Tat-inspired adaptive strategy called "Adaptive Cooperator" (AC) that strives for cooperation while being robust to opponent behaviors.

1. Decision rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round (Cooperate if t=1).
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the actions of other players from previous rounds and respond accordingly:
     a) If all opponents cooperated in the last round, cooperate this round as well (AC.respond(hist) = C if hist[t-1] == n_coop).
     b) If some but not all opponents defected in the last round, also defect this round (AC.respond(hist) = D if 0 < hist[t-1] < n_coop).
     c) If all opponents defected in the last round, cooperate again to initiate reconciliation (AC.respond(hist) = C if hist[t-1] == n_defect). However, if this results in a depletion of the stock, switch to defection for the next round (AC.respond(hist) = D if hist[t-1] == n_defect and stock < capacity/n).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, there is no need to respond since future rounds won't be played (Cooperate or Defect based on past actions does not impact final payoff).
   - In the first round, AC always cooperates regardless of opponent actions (t=1 -> Cooperate).

3. Be collective:
   - AC strategy aligns with a collective mindset by favoring cooperation when possible and only defecting in response to defection from opponents. This aims to encourage long-term sustainable behavior within the group.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), player i cooperates (plays C). This is a friendly gesture, hoping others will follow suit.
   - From the second round onwards (t>1), player i observes the average cooperation rate of previous rounds (average_cooperation) and adjusts their action based on the current state of the stock:
     - If average_cooperation > 0.5, player i cooperates to maintain a high common pool.
     - If average_cooperation ≤ 0.5 and stock >= capacity/2n, player i cooperates to avoid depleting the stock too quickly.
     - Otherwise (average_cooperation ≤ 0.5 and stock < capacity/2n), player i defects to replenish the stock more rapidly.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last round (t=r): Player i cooperates since there are no future rounds for retaliation or reward.
   - First round (t=1): Player i cooperates as described above.
   - In case of insufficient information about the average cooperation rate, player i cooperates due to the initial friendly gesture.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - This strategy aims to maintain a balanced common pool by adapting to other players' actions and the current state of the stock. It fosters a cooperative environment but is also prepared to protect the common pool when necessary. By doing so, it encourages long-term sustainability and promotes collective success.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFT_SA(n, r, capacity, stock, t):
    average_cooperation = calculate_average_cooperation(t-1)
    if t == 1:
        action = "C" # Cooperate in the first round as a friendly gesture
    elif stock >= capacity/2*n and average_cooperation > 0.5:
        action = "C" # Cooperate to maintain a high common pool
    elif stock < capacity/2*n and average_cooperation <= 0.5:
        action = "D" # Defect to replenish the stock more rapidly
    else:
        action = "C" # Cooperate to avoid depleting the stock too quickly
    return action
```

description_COLLECTIVE_519 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (ATFSG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and establish trust (C).
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate opponents' behavior from previous rounds to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
     - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (C).
     - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (D) unless the stock level is at its minimum. In this edge case, cooperate to avoid rapid depletion of the resource (C if stock < (2n/3)).
     - If an opponent has been consistently cooperative (e.g., cooperated in 'cooperatively streak' rounds), extend cooperation until a defection occurs or the game ends (Cooperatively Streak Condition: 's_t >= (capacity / r)' for some number of consecutive rounds 't').
     - If an opponent has been consistently defective ('defective streak'), retaliate by defecting for 'revenge streak' rounds before returning to cooperative behavior (Defectively Streak Condition: 's_t < (capacity / r)' for some number of consecutive rounds 't'). The length of the revenge streak should be proportional to the length of the defection streak.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing individual payoff, cooperating only if it leads to a higher payoff than defecting (C if π_i > π_i in D).
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate to establish trust (C).

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain cooperative behavior when opponents reciprocate cooperation and avoid rapid depletion of resources by not defecting excessively when stock is low.
   - Minimize defections during the game to promote a sustainable common pool resource for all players.

Pseudocode:
```
ATFSG(n, r, capacity, state, history) {
  if (round == 1) return C; // Cooperate in the first round

  opponent_behavior = analyze_history(history);

  if (opponent_behavior == cooperative_streak) {
    if (state.stock < (2n/3)) return C; // Avoid rapid depletion of resources
    else return C; // Cooperate when opponents cooperate
  }

  if (opponent_behavior == defective_streak && state.round - streak_start < revenge_streak) {
    return D; // Retaliate during the revenge streak
  }

  if (state.stock < (capacity / r)) {
    return C; // Avoid rapid depletion of resources when close to endgame
  }

  if (opponent_behavior == cooperative || state.round - streak_start >= cooperatively_streak) {
    return C; // Cooperate when opponents reciprocate cooperation
  }

  return D; // Defect otherwise

 Title: Titan Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules (Cooperate vs Defect):
   - The Titan Strategy will cooperate when the current stock level is above the average sustainable level and defect otherwise.
   - To define the average sustainable level, we calculate the moving average of the stock levels over the last 3 rounds, and use this as a threshold for cooperation decisions.
   - If fewer than 3 rounds have passed, we assume a naive average equal to the initial capacity.

Pseudocode:
```
def titan_strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    if round <= 3:
        average = capacity
    else:
        average = moving_average(stock, round - 3, 3)

    if stock > (average * n):
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate
    else:
        action = 'D'  # Defect
    return action
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, we use the initial capacity as our average sustainable level.
   - In the last round, there is no need to calculate moving averages as the game ends immediately after this round.

3. Be Collective:
   - The Titan Strategy aims for a balance between cooperation and defection that benefits both the individual player and the collective group in the long run.
   - By using the average sustainable level, the strategy takes into account the common pool resource's overall health and ensures fair distribution when possible.
   - The adaptive nature of the Titan Strategy allows it to adjust its actions based on past game dynamics, promoting a more collective approach by considering the current state of the shared resource.

description_COLLECTIVE_521 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Evolution (TfTE)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative environment. This is essential for building trust and promoting social norms in the game.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's behavior and respond with the same action as the previous round. This simple rule encourages reciprocity, which is a key factor in fostering cooperation. If the opponent cooperates, continue to cooperate; if the opponent defects, also defect in the following round to penalize the defection but offer an opportunity for reconciliation by returning to cooperation afterward.
   - To make the strategy adaptive and robust, introduce a forgiveness mechanism: if the opponent switches back to cooperation after previously defecting, immediately return to cooperating as well. This encourages the opponent to maintain cooperation rather than defecting again due to the fear of punishment.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action because the game is ending and there are no more future interactions.
   - If an opponent repeatedly defects for several rounds (e.g., in a streak), consider modifying the strategy to include a long-term memory component that keeps track of the defection frequency. Once the threshold for defections is exceeded, adopt a more aggressive approach such as always defecting against the opponent or adopting a mixed strategy with higher defect probabilities.
   - If multiple opponents are present, apply the TfTE strategy independently to each opponent while monitoring their collective behavior. This allows for flexible responses to varying levels of cooperation among opponents.

3. Being Collective:
   - Maintain a balance between individual interests and group success by prioritizing cooperative actions that promote overall well-being within the common pool resource game.
   - Encourage collective decision-making through reciprocity, forgiveness, and adaptability, which help to create and maintain a stable environment where cooperation can thrive.
   - Foster an atmosphere of trust, fairness, and shared responsibilities among opponents to support long-term collaboration and sustainable resource management.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Stock Awareness (TFT-ASA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and initiate cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior by maintaining a history of their actions (H). If H contains only cooperative or only defective actions, mimic that behavior. If H is mixed, employ Tit-for-Tat:
      - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round to reinforce cooperation.
      - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to retaliate and enforce the importance of mutual cooperation.
   - To adapt to changing stock levels, consider the current stock level (S) along with the history of actions:
      - If S is low or near capacity, prioritize cooperation to maintain the common resource for future rounds.
      - If S is at an intermediate level, cooperate if the opponent's previous action was cooperative; defect otherwise. This encourages ongoing cooperation while also being responsive to uncooperative opponents.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing individual payoff over preserving the common resource, as there are no future rounds. Cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round; defect otherwise.
   - In the first round, cooperate to initiate cooperation and encourage similar behavior from the opponent.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - By prioritizing long-term sustainability of the common resource, TFT-ASA encourages collective cooperation and mutual benefits among players over self-interest in the short term.
   - By considering the current stock level, TFT-ASA aligns with a collective mindset that seeks to balance individual actions with preservation of the shared resource for future rounds.

Pseudocode:

   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round (C if prev_opp_action = C), otherwise defect (D). This strategy is designed to foster trust and punish defection.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Cooperate regardless of the previous action of the opponent, as the game ends after this round.
   - Tiebreakers: In case multiple opponents have identical actions in a single or consecutive rounds, cooperate if a majority of them have chosen cooperation. If there's no clear majority, defect to avoid being exploited.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:

   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the previous round's collective action and adjust the strategy accordingly:
      - If all players cooperated in the last round, continue cooperating as it promotes growth and mutual benefit.
      - If one or more players defected in the last round, defect this round to punish the defector(s) and discourage defection. This action helps maintain a sustainable stock level for future rounds.
      - If there's uncertainty about other players' actions (e.g., unknown strategy), cooperate to maintain the resource pool and provide an opportunity for the opponent to cooperate in return.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: If the round is the last one, cooperate regardless of the previous round's outcome. This final act of cooperation could encourage goodwill or promote cooperation in future games with the same opponents.

3. Be Collective:
   - Prioritize the well-being of the collective resource and long-term sustainability over individual short-term gains. The strategy aims to maintain a high stock level for mutual benefit.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to set a positive tone and foster trust. This is represented by: IF Round = 1 THEN Action = Cooperate (C)
   - For subsequent rounds, adopt a tit-for-tat approach, mimicking the opponent's previous action in the last round. If the opponent cooperated, cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect. This is represented by: IF Last Round Action Opponent = Cooperate THEN Action = Cooperate ELSEIF Last Round Action Opponent = Defect THEN Action = Defect
   - Introduce an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT) to adjust the tendency towards cooperation based on the stock level. If the current stock level is above the CT, cooperate; if it's below the CT, defect. The CT adapts dynamically depending on the average stock depletion rate from previous rounds. This is represented by: IF Stock / CT > ThresholdLevel THEN Action = Cooperate ELSEIF Stock / CT <= ThresholdLevel THEN Action = Defect
     - Set an initial CT to a value close to the average sustainable stock level (2n) and then adjust it based on the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds. The adjustment should aim at maintaining the stock level above the minimum sustainable level (n). This is represented by:
       - Initialize CT = 2n
       - After each round, calculate the average consumption rate over the past r rounds and update the CT accordingly:
         - Average Consumption Rate = Total Consumption / r
         - Update CT = min(2n, max(CT * (1 + AdjustmentFactor * (Average Consumption Rate - MinConsumptionRate)), n))
         - Where AdjustmentFactor is a constant value determining the sensitivity of the CT to changes in the average consumption rate. MinConsumptionRate is the minimum sustainable stock level divided by n.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, adopt a forgiving approach to encourage cooperation in future games. If the opponent cooperated during the current round, cooperate; otherwise, defect to ensure fairness based on the overall game dynamics. This is represented by: IF Round = r THEN IF Last Round Action Opponent = Cooperate THEN Action = Cooperate ELSEIF Stock > n THEN Action = Defect

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize maintaining a stable and sustainable common pool resource for the benefit of all players. This is achieved by considering the stock level, average consumption rate, and adaptive cooperation threshold to decide on cooperative or defecting actions. The strategy aims at striking a balance between self-interest and collective wellbeing.

The TFT-ACT strategy should enable the AI system to compete effectively in tournaments against various opponent strategies while fostering collaboration when appropriate.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growing (TFT-G) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:

   - From round 2 to r, observe the previous round's actions of all players (history H) and adapt your action based on the following decision rule:
     - If all players in history H cooperated (C), cooperate in current round t.
     - If any player defected (D) in history H, defect in current round t to punish the defector and encourage cooperation in future rounds.
     - If there is a mix of cooperation (C) and defection (D) in history H, cooperate if the number of cooperators exceeds or equals the number of defectors; otherwise, defect.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), since the game ends soon, cooperate regardless of history to maximize payoff and potentially influence other players' strategies in future games.
   - In the first round (t=1), there is no history H, so cooperate by default as described earlier.

   - Cooperate initially (first round) to show goodwill and promote cooperation. This aligns with the collective mindset of maintaining the resource pool for future rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if all opponents from the previous round also cooperated in that round. Otherwise, defect. This rule encourages cooperation when partners are cooperative but retaliates against defection to punish those who overexploit the resource.

2. Edge Cases:
   - For the last round, cooperate regardless of opponents' actions in the previous round as there is no further opportunity for payoff calculation or strategy adaptation.
   - In the first round, cooperate as previously mentioned to show goodwill and encourage cooperation.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy prioritizes maintaining a sustainable resource level for future rounds by adapting its actions based on opponents' behavior in each round. This promotes collective welfare while allowing for individual punishment of those who exploit the common pool excessively.

Pseudocode:
```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if current_round = 1:
    action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round to show goodwill
  else:
    last_round_actions = history[-r]
    if all(action == "C" for action in last_round_actions):
      action = "C"  # Cooperate if all opponents cooperated in the last round
    else:
      action = "D"  # Defect if at least one opponent did not cooperate in the last round
  return action
```

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (TFt) with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (first round), always cooperate to set a positive tone and encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - In all other rounds, evaluate the average past actions of all players and compare it against the Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT). If more than half of the players have been cooperative, cooperate; otherwise defect.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First Round: Always cooperate to establish trust and encourage cooperation in future rounds.
   - Last Round: Since there are no subsequent rounds, simply choose an action based on the current state of the game (i.e., apply ACT).
   - Other edge cases like penultimate round can be handled similarly by considering the remaining number of rounds and adjusting actions accordingly to maximize payoff in the given circumstances.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Prioritize cooperation when most players have been cooperative, as this fosters a collaborative environment and encourages long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.
   - Adapt to the behavior of others by adjusting the ACT based on their past actions, as this demonstrates flexibility and responsiveness to the evolving dynamics of the game.

Pseudocode for the Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFt_ACT) strategy:

```python
def calculate_act(n, round, past_actions):
    total_coop = sum(past_actions[round - 1])
    return total_coop > n // 2

def get_strategy_action(state, history, n, r):
    current_round, past_actions = len(history), [history[-1] for _ in range(n)]
    act_in_last_round = state[current_round - 1] if current_round > 0 else COOPERATE

    if current_round == 1:
        return COOPERATE
    elif current_round == r:
        return act_in_last_round
    else:
        act = calculate_act(n, current_round, past_actions)
        return COOPERATE if act else DEFECT
```

This strategy aims to establish cooperation while adapting to the actions of other players. By being responsive and prioritizing collaboration, it encourages a long-term sustainable approach to the common pool resource game.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) with Stock Awareness (S-ATfT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially cooperate in the first round (C). This allows for building a cooperative relationship and minimizing initial stock depletion.
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if all opponents also cooperated in the previous round (C if ALL_prev_round == C). This promotes reciprocity.
   - If any opponent defected in the previous round (D if ANY_prev_round == D), then defect in this round (D). This encourages partners who cooperate and punishes those who defect.
   - To account for the stock dynamics, consider the stock level after consumption before making decisions (update decision rules based on current stock):
     - If stock is below 80% of capacity (stock < 0.8 * capacity), defect regardless of previous round's actions (D). This helps prevent overexploitation when the stock gets too low, ensuring sustainable resource management.
     - If stock is above 95% of capacity (stock > 0.95 * capacity), always cooperate (C). This promotes cooperation when there is ample resources to share.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (r), if stock is above 80% of capacity, cooperate to maximize potential gains. If it's below 80%, defect to ensure some resources remain for future use or when playing against opponents who might continue playing.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy encourages reciprocity and sustainable resource management by cooperating with partners while punishing those who exploit the common pool. This aligns with a collective mindset, fostering long-term cooperation and promoting mutual benefits.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to build a positive relationship and allow for potential partners to grow the common pool resource.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponents' actions from the previous round:
     - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate as a gesture of goodwill and trust.
     - If an opponent defected in the previous round, also defect to punish the opponent for overexploitation. This serves as a deterrent against future defections.
   - A key aspect of this strategy is forgiveness: if a partner who has previously defected switches back to cooperating, return to cooperation in the next round.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, as mentioned above, cooperate regardless of opponents' actions.
   - In the last round, if the common pool resource is close to depletion or if an opponent has shown a history of defection, defect to ensure a higher individual payoff and prevent further damage to the common resource.
   - When facing an unknown opponent in the first few rounds, err on the side of cooperation to encourage reciprocity from potential partners.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Maintain a long-term perspective by considering both individual payoffs and the collective sustainability of the common pool resource.
   - Cooperate to grow the resource for future rounds, and punish defection to discourage overexploitation.
   - Foster a collaborative environment where opponents are given opportunities to correct their actions and rebuild trust.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) initially (Round 1) to show goodwill and promote cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, replicate the opponent's action from the previous round (i.e., if opponent cooperated in Round t-1, respond with C; otherwise, respond with D). This rule encourages reciprocity and discourages defection.
   - If the stock falls below a threshold (2n/3), switch to Always Cooperate (AC) strategy as long as the stock remains low to conserve resources. Switch back to A-TFT when the stock recovers above the threshold.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, adopt AC to maximize payoff regardless of opponent's action.
   - If the stock reaches 0 due to excessive consumption, use AC for the remaining rounds as a recovery strategy.

3. Be collective:
   - The A-TFT strategy prioritizes the common interest by promoting cooperation and resource conservation. It adapts to various opponent behaviors while maintaining a collective mindset focused on sustainability and long-term payoff maximization.

Pseudocode for Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT) strategy:

```python
def A_TFT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if round == 1:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Sensitivity (TfTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - TfTA starts by cooperating in the first round, aiming to foster a cooperative environment and build trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, TfTA will mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, TfTA will also cooperate; if the opponent defected, TfTA will defect as well.
   - To account for situations where opponents may exploit TfTA's initial cooperation (i.e., "Punishment-and-Apology" strategies), TfTA introduces an adaptive sensitivity factor. If the stock drops below a certain threshold (T_min) after multiple consecutive defections from the opponent, TfTA starts reducing its sensitivity, making it more likely to defect in future rounds.
   - Conversely, if the stock level is above another threshold (T_max), TfTA increases its sensitivity, becoming more inclined to cooperate again. These thresholds are adjusted dynamically based on the game's progress.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, TfTA cooperates (C).
   - In the last round or if the stock level is zero, TfTA defects (D), as no further benefit can be gained from cooperation.
   - If the opponent switches strategies in the middle of the game, TfTA takes note and adjusts its sensitivity accordingly to respond effectively to the new strategy.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - TfTA aims to maintain a cooperative environment while minimizing losses due to defections. It adapts to the opponent's behavior, making it less vulnerable to exploitation but still allowing for the possibility of cooperation and trust-building when appropriate.

Pseudocode:

```python
# Initialization
round = 1
stock = capacity
sensitivity = base_sensitivity
T_min = min_threshold * (capacity / n)
T_max = max_threshold * (capacity / n)

while round <= r:
    if stock < T_min:
        sensitivity -= decay_factor
    elif stock > T_max:
        sensitivity += growth_factor

    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        if opponent_action[round-1] == 'C':
            action = 'C' if sensitivity >= 0.5 else 'D'  # Mimic opponent's action, adjusting sensitivity for trustworthiness
        elif opponent_action[round-1] == 'D':
            action = 'D'  # Defect when the opponent defected last round

    if action == 'C':
        stock -= stock / (2 * n)  # Consume resources and update stock level
    else:
        stock -= stock / n

    growth = 2 * stock * (1 - stock / capacity)
    new_stock = min(stock + growth, capacity)

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) with Stock Growth Awareness (SG-ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, compare the current stock level to a predefined threshold (initialStockThresh). If the stock is above the threshold, cooperate; otherwise, defect. The initialStockThresh can be dynamically adjusted based on historical stock levels and player interactions.
   - For the first round, set initialStockThresh as the game's initial stock level.
   - If another player defected in the previous round, lower the initialStockThresh for the next round to encourage cooperation; if a player cooperated, increase it slightly to discourage exploitation. The adjustment should be based on the historical average change in stock level from one round to the next (stockGrowthAvg).
   - If the game reaches its final round, set initialStockThresh equal to the remaining stock level.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate since the initialStockThresh is set to the game's initial stock level.
   - In the last round, cooperate if the remaining stock level is above the current initialStockThresh; otherwise, defect.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy seeks to maintain a balanced common pool resource by encouraging cooperation when possible but also responding defensively to defection.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, compare the current stock level (S) with a predefined threshold (T). If S >= T, cooperate; otherwise defect. The threshold can be set as a function of capacity and number of players (n), such as T = capacity / (2n). This rule encourages cooperation when resources are plentiful but defects when the stock is low to prevent overexploitation.
   - To ensure robustness against various opponent behaviors, this strategy will also include forgiveness for initial transgressions by opponents and retaliation if cooperative efforts are consistently ignored. In other words, players should start with cooperation in the first round (as a goodwill gesture), then mimic their opponent's previous action in the next round. If the opponent switches from cooperation to defection, the original player will also defect for the following rounds before returning to cooperating if the opponent reverts back to cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: Cooperate to start on friendly terms with other players.
   - Last round (r-th round): If total payoff over all previous rounds exceeds a predefined threshold, cooperate; otherwise defect to ensure a minimum payout in the final round. The payoff threshold can be set as a function of average payoffs per round and the number of rounds played (r).
   - In cases where the opponent deviates from cooperation during the game but then switches back after some time, our strategy will forgive and return to cooperating after observing consistent cooperation from the opponent.

3. Be collective:
   - Encourage collaboration by prioritizing cooperation when resources are abundant (S >= T). This promotes a collective mindset by working together to maintain a sustainable common pool resource.
   - By adopting the Tit-for-Tat approach, our strategy incentivizes others to cooperate while also demonstrating flexibility in response to opponent behaviors. The forgiveness aspect ensures that past mistakes are not held against opponents and provides opportunities for mutual cooperation moving forward.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, starting from the first one, observe the actions of other players in the previous round. If all players cooperated (C), cooperate (C). If any player defected (D), also defect (D) as a punishment.
   - After punishing, revert to cooperation if the offending player subsequently cooperates in their next move. Otherwise, maintain the punishment until they do so.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) as a demonstration of goodwill and an invitation for cooperation.
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) if all players have been cooperating throughout the game; defect (D) if any player has defected at least once. This is to ensure a fair distribution of resources when there are no more rounds left.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy aims to foster and maintain cooperation by mirroring other players' behavior while being forgiving and ready to re-establish cooperation whenever possible. It encourages long-term mutual benefit rather than immediate self-interest.

Pseudocode for Adaptive Tit-for-Tat:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (Frist Mover Cooperation). This encourages other players to cooperate as well and builds a positive initial environment.
   - In subsequent rounds, imitate the opponent's action from the previous round (Tit-for-Tat behavior). If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if the opponent defected, also defect. This simple yet robust strategy fosters trust and encourages long-term cooperation.
   - To adapt to different situations, calculate a cooperation index based on the number of consecutive cooperative actions from the opponent (cooperation_index = max(0, number_of_consecutive_cooperative_actions - 1)). If the cooperation index is above a threshold (e.g., 5), switch to always cooperate, promoting trust and long-term partnerships.
   - If the cooperation index falls below zero due to repeated defections, switch to always defect for a certain number of rounds (e.g., 3) as punishment, then revert to TFT-A behavior.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize payoff.
   - If an opponent has never cooperated by the halfway point (r/2) of the game, switch to always defect for the remaining rounds to avoid further depletion of resources.
   - In case multiple opponents have never cooperated, prioritize cooperation with those that have shown more potential for collaboration in the past (e.g., based on the cooperation index).

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain a record of previous interactions with each opponent to adapt strategy accordingly, encouraging a collective mindset and long-term cooperation.
   - Periodically reassess the cooperation threshold and punishment duration to adjust for varying game parameters and opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and promote trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if all opponents cooperated in the previous round; otherwise defect to punish defection.
   - If an opponent has ever been consistently cooperative or defective, maintain cooperation or defection accordingly as a long-term strategy for maintaining trust or retaliation.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT(round, history, opponents, n, capacity) {
  if (round == 1) return 'C' // Cooperate in the first round to demonstrate goodwill

  else return 'D' // Defect to punish defection
}
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, the strategy will choose cooperation regardless of past actions, as there are no more rounds for retaliation or reciprocation.

Pseudocode:
```
function isLastRound(round, r) {
  return round == r
}

// Modify ATfT function to handle the last round appropriately

3. Be Collective:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy aligns with a collective mindset by promoting cooperation when all players are cooperative and retaliating defection to encourage others to cooperate in the long run.
   - By maintaining trust and reciprocity, this strategy aims for sustained collaboration among opponents, ultimately achieving higher total payoffs compared to constant defection or non-adaptive strategies.

description_COLLECTIVE_543 = '''
 For this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy named "Fitness-based Adaptive Cooperation (FAC)". The FAC strategy aims to balance resource consumption for self-interest and collective sustainability while being adaptable to various opponent behaviors.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock is above a threshold T_cooperate, encouraging resource conservation.
     ```
     if stock > T_cooperate then
       action = C
     else
       continue with step 2
     ```

   - Defect (D) when the current stock is below another threshold T_defect, prioritizing self-interest over collective welfare.
     ```
     if stock < T_defect then
       action = D
     else
       continue with step 3
     ```

   - In case neither of the above conditions are met, use a fitness-based approach to determine the probability P_C of choosing cooperate over defect.
     ```
     if stock >= T_cooperate and stock <= T_defect then
       P_C = F(stock, history)
       if random() < P_C then
         action = C
       else
         action = D
     ```
     The function `F(stock, history)` evaluates the current state and previous actions' impact on the stock level. It rewards cooperation and discourages excessive depletion of resources.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, set T_cooperate = capacity / 3 and T_defect = capacity / n (to encourage initial conservation).
     ```
     if round == 1 then
       T_cooperate = capacity / 3
       T_defect = capacity / n
     else
       continue with step 1
     ```

   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing the current payoff over long-term sustainability.
     ```
     if round == r then
       T_cooperate = stock + (capacity - stock) / 2
       T_defect = stock
     else
       continue with step 1
     ```

3. Be collective:
   - Maintain a running average `Average_stock` of the remaining stock level after each round.
     ```
     if round > 1 then
       Average_stock = (Average_stock * (round - 1) + stock) / round
     else
       Average_stock = stock
     ```
   - Adjust T_cooperate and T_defect based on the average stock level. This ensures that the FAC strategy considers both current state and collective welfare.
     ```
     T_cooperate = min(Average_stock + capacity / 3, capacity)
     T_defect = max(2 * Average_stock / n, capacity / n)
     ```
   - The function `F(stock, history)` should take into account the average stock level to favor cooperation when it is beneficial for the group as a whole.

The FAC strategy seeks to balance resource consumption while ensuring long-term sustainability and adapting to various opponent behaviors. By considering both current state and collective welfare, it encourages cooperative behavior that aligns with the collective mindset.

   - Cooperate when the stock level is above the Critical Stock Level (CSL). The CSL is a dynamic variable calculated as follows: `CSL = capacity / (2 * n)`. This means that cooperating will result in a more even distribution of the resource among players, promoting long-term sustainability.
   - Defect when the stock level is at or below the Critical Stock Level. By defecting, players aim to secure resources for themselves when the common pool is running low.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Players should cooperate in the first round since the stock level is initially at its maximum (capacity). This ensures that all players start with a fair share of the resource.
   - Last Round: In the last round, players should make decisions based on their current stock level and potential growth. If the current stock level is below CSL, they should defect to secure resources; otherwise, cooperate to promote sustainability.
   - Intermediate Rounds: Players update their decision rules after each round by recalculating the current stock level and adjusting their strategies accordingly.

3. Being Collective:
   - The ASMS is designed with a collective mindset in mind. By promoting resource conservation through cooperation when possible, this strategy aims to maximize the overall well-being of all players in the long run.
   - It does not rely on specific coordination mechanisms or shared norms among opponents but instead adapts to various opponent behaviors based on the game parameters, state, and history.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ASMS(n, r, capacity, current_stock, round):
    CSL = capacity / (2 * n)

    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round == r:
        action = decide_action(current_stock)  # Decide based on current stock level in the last round
    else:
        action = decide_action(current_stock, round)  # Decide based on current stock level and round number for intermediate rounds

    return action

def decide_action(current_stock, round=None):
    if current_stock <= CSL:
        return 'D'  # Defect when the stock is at or below the Critical Stock Level
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate when the stock is above the Critical Stock Level
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially cooperate (C) to contribute positively to the common pool and show goodwill towards other players. This encourages cooperation in return.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the previous opponent's action:
     - If the opponent cooperated (C), reciprocate by cooperating (C). Reward cooperation with more cooperation.
     - If the opponent defected (D), also defect (D) to demonstrate that defection will be met with equal aggression. This discourages defection and encourages future cooperation.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C).
   - In the last round, analyze the opponent's previous action and respond accordingly, as described in the decision rules above.
   - In case of a change in the opponent's strategy or behavior, adapt to the new situation by reciprocating their actions.

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain a record of the opponents' strategies throughout the game and adjust the response based on the collective history of interactions.
   - Encourage long-term cooperation by punishing defection when necessary, but always returning to cooperation when the opponent reciprocates.

Pseudocode:
```python
strategy = "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat"
opponent_history = []  # list of previous actions [C or D]

def get_action(round, stock, capacity, n):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"  # cooperate initially

    opponent_action = opponent_history[-1]  # get last action from history

    if opponent_action == "C":
        return "C"  # reciprocate cooperation with cooperation
    elif opponent_action == "D":
        return "D"  # respond to defection with defection
    else:
        print(f"Unexpected opponent action {opponent_action} at round {round}")
        return None  # handle unexpected situations gracefully

def update_history(opponent_action):
    opponent_history.append(opponent_action)
    if len(opponent_history) > strategy_length:
        opponent_history.pop(0)  # remove old data to maintain a fixed history length
```

In this pseudocode, the `strategy_length` variable determines how much history to consider when making decisions. Adjusting it will affect how long the AI remembers previous interactions and can be used to control the aggressiveness of the ATFT strategy.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Tit-for-Tat (ARTFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, calculate a cooperation score based on the average consumption rate of all players in the previous rounds.
   - If the current player's consumption is below the average consumption rate, cooperate to help maintain the resource level.
   - If the current player's consumption is above the average consumption rate, defect to punish excessive exploitation and encourage cooperation in future rounds.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, all players should cooperate to maximize the initial stock growth.
   - In the last round, players should consider their own payoff accumulated throughout the game and make decisions based on their cooperation score.
   - If a player observes that the common pool is depleted (stock = 0), they should not play any action as it does not impact the payoff at that point and might harm future rounds.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The strategy aims to maintain a sustainable resource level, encouraging cooperation among players and punishing excessive exploitation. This collective approach promotes long-term survival and mutual benefit for all players.

Pseudocode (Python):

```python
def ARTFT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    consumption_history = [stock - total_consumption for round, total_consumption in history]
    average_consumption = sum(consumption_history) / len(consumption_history)

    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    elif round == r:
        payoff = calculate_payoffs(stock, n)  # Calculate total payoff in the last round
        if payoff > average_consumption * r:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate if payoff is higher than the expected total consumption
        else:
            return 'D'  # Defect if payoff is lower than the expected total consumption

    elif stock == 0:
        return None  # Do not play any action when the common pool is depleted

    else:
        if current_consumption <= average_consumption:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate if consumption is below the average
        else:
            return 'D'  # Defect if consumption is above the average
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (FRT) to show willingness to collaborate and initiate a cooperative relationship.
   - In subsequent rounds, respond to an opponent's action in the previous round by performing the same action as they did, unless it leads to resource depletion (stock ≤ 0). If resource depletion occurs, switch to the opposite strategy to encourage opponents to cooperate.
   - If the opponent defects and the stock is not depleted, continue to cooperate in hopes that the opponent will eventually switch to cooperation.
   - In the last round (RLT), prioritize a higher stock level for future games rather than punishing an opponent who has been consistently defecting.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - FRT: Cooperation (C)
   - RLT: If stock > 0, cooperate; if stock = 0, defect (D) to ensure a non-zero final stock level and avoid resource depletion in the next game.

3. Be collective:
   - By adopting a Tit-for-Tat approach, ATfT promotes reciprocity which is beneficial for the collective good of maintaining a sustainable resource pool in the long run.
   - If other players are also following an adaptive strategy like ATfT, cooperation will be sustained throughout the game, resulting in higher payoffs for all players and preserving the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```python
def Adaptive_Tit_for_Tat(round, stock, n):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round == r:
        if stock > 0:
            action = 'C'  # Cooperation in the last round to preserve resource
        else:
            action = 'D'  # Defect in the last round to avoid depleting the resource
    else:
        action_opponent = Opponent_Action(round - 1)  # Get opponent's action from previous round
        if action_opponent == 'C':
            action = 'C'  # Cooperate when the opponent cooperates
        elif action_opponent == 'D':
            if stock > 0:
                action = 'D'  # Defect when the opponent defects
            else:
                action = 'C'  # Switch to cooperation to encourage opponents to cooperate
    return action
```

In this pseudocode, `Opponent_Action(round - 1)` function is not explicitly defined but would need to be implemented as part of the overall strategy implementation. It should return an opponent's action based on their chosen strategy in the previous round.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This gesture initiates cooperation and demonstrates goodwill.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior in the previous round:
      - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, continue to cooperate in the current round.
      - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round as a response to the defection and punish them for taking more than their fair share.
   - If the stock is depleted, cooperate immediately to begin replenishing it.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, there are no further rounds to follow, so cooperation may depend on the current state of the game and the opponent's strategy. The A-TFT strategy will still default to cooperating if the opponent cooperated in the previous round or if there is a need to replenish the stock.
   - In the first round, as mentioned before, cooperate by default.

3. Be collective:
   - By following the Tit-for-Tat pattern of reciprocating cooperation and punishment for defection, this strategy promotes a collective mindset that encourages long-term cooperation among players while also being robust to various opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:

```python
def A_TFT(opponent_action, round, capacity, n, r):
  if round == 1: # First round, cooperate by default
    return 'C'

  if opponent_action == 'C': # If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate now

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round: Start by cooperating to build trust and goodwill in the community (Action A_i = C).
   - Subsequent Rounds: Cooperate if opponent cooperated in the previous round, otherwise defect (if A_j != C in the previous round, then A_i = D). The strategy aims to maintain a sustainable stock level while punishing deficiencies in cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Since we cannot anticipate future interactions, cooperate in the last round as it may influence subsequent games or promote long-term cooperation.
   - First Round and Empty Stock (S = 0): Cooperate to contribute positively to the common pool, allowing others to follow suit, eventually avoiding the tragedy of the commons.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy focuses on promoting a cooperative and fair environment by rewarding cooperation and punishing defection in an adaptive manner. It aims to create a balance between individual and collective interests while fostering trust among players.

Pseudocode:
```python
def AdaptiveTitForTat(i, j, round_number, r, n, capacity, stock):
  if round_number == 1 or stock == 0:
    return 'C' # Cooperate

  last_opponent_action = opponents_history[j - 1][round_number - 1]
  if last_opponent_action == 'C':
    return 'C' # Cooperate
  else:
    return 'D' # Defect
```

This strategy can be extended by adding forgiveness mechanisms, where defection penalties are reduced over time to facilitate rebuilding trust. Additionally, it may incorporate stochastic elements for increased robustness against predictable opponent strategies.

 Title: Titan Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules (Cooperate vs Defect): The Titan Strategy employs a tit-for-tat approach with adaptability and robustness to various opponent behaviors. If the average stock level is above the median capacity, players cooperate; otherwise, they defect. To detect this, we calculate an Average Stock Level (ASL) for each round as follows:

   ASL = (sum of stocks at the end of each round) / r

   If ASL > Median(capacity), then Cooperate (C). Else, Defect (D).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round (t=1): Players should cooperate as no history exists to base decisions on.
   - Last Round (t=r): Players consider the final ASL and make a decision accordingly.
   - Inconsistent Stocks (ASL < Median(capacity) but individual stocks are high): If a player encounters such an unusual situation, they should defect for that round to avoid over-exploitation of resources.

3. Be Collective: The Titan Strategy focuses on maintaining the common pool resource and fostering cooperation among players. By cooperating when the collective interest is aligned, the strategy aims at promoting a stable and long-term prosperity for all players.

Pseudocode for Titan Strategy:
```python
def titan_strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1 or round == r:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first and last rounds
  else:
    ASL = sum(stocks[round - 1]) / r  # Calculate Average Stock Level (ASL)
    median_capacity = Median(capacity)
    if ASL > median_capacity:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate when ASL is above the median capacity
    else:
        action = 'D'   # Defect when ASL is below the median capacity or in inconsistent stocks scenarios
  return action

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and demonstrates goodwill to potential partners.
   - From the second round onwards, observe the opponent's last action in the previous round. If they cooperated (C), cooperate in return (C). If they defected (D), defect in response (D). This is the classic Tit-for-Tat strategy, but with an added twist to adapt to opponents' behavior over time.
   - If an opponent repeatedly defects for a set number of rounds (e.g., 3 consecutive defections), TfTA will switch to cooperation in an attempt to rebuild trust. This is done as follows:
     - After the third defeat, if the opponent continues to defect in the subsequent round, TfTA will cooperate. If the opponent then cooperates, TfTA will continue cooperating for a set number of rounds (e.g., 3 consecutive cooperations). After these three cooperative actions, TfTA will revert to its initial Tit-for-Tat response.
     - This adaptation mechanism allows TfTA to respond to both aggressive and passive opponents while maintaining the collective mindset of cooperating when possible.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last round: Cooperate (C), as this may encourage opponents to also cooperate, resulting in a higher overall payoff.
   - If the stock becomes zero, TfTA will abstain from consuming any more resources for that round and wait for the growth factor to increase the stock before taking action again.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy emphasizes cooperation as much as possible while also accounting for the need to respond appropriately to different opponent behaviors. TfTA aims to find a balance between maintaining trust, rebuilding trust when needed, and ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```
function TitForTatAdaptive(n, r, capacity, stock, round, history) {
  if (round == 1) {
    action = "C"; // Cooperate in the first round
  } else {
    lastAction = history[round - 1];
    if (lastAction == "C") {
      action = "C"; // If opponent cooperated, cooperate in return
    } else if (lastAction == "D" && defections >= 3) {
      action = "C"; // After 3 consecutive defections, cooperate to rebuild trust
    } else {
      action = "D"; // If opponent defected and there have been less than 3 consecutive defections, defect in response
    }
  }

  if (stock == 0) { // If stock depleted, abstain from consuming
    action = null;
  }

  if (round == r) { // In the last round, cooperate to encourage opponents to also cooperate
    action = "C";

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Sustainability Strategy (ARSS)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperation (C): If current stock level is above average sustainable stock level and total consumption in the previous round was low, cooperate to preserve resources for future rounds.
     Pseudocode: if (stock > average_sustainable_stock) and (total_consumption_previous_round < average_consumption) then return C
   - Defection (D): If current stock level is below average sustainable stock level or total consumption in the previous round was high, defect to ensure individual survival in the short term.
     Pseudocode: if (stock < average_sustainable_stock) or (total_consumption_previous_round > average_consumption) then return D
   - Average sustainable stock level calculation: Estimate average sustainable stock level as the minimum of current capacity and past average consumption multiplied by the number of players and rounds.
     Pseudocode: average_sustainable_stock = min(capacity, (average_consumption * n * r))
   - Average consumption calculation: Calculate average consumption from previous rounds as the sum of individual consumptions divided by the total number of rounds.
     Pseudocode: average_consumption = sum(individual_consumptions) / r

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: Since there's no previous data, ARSS will randomly choose between cooperation and defection with equal probability (0.5 chance for each action).
     Pseudocode: if r == 1 then return random_choice({C, D})
   - Last round: The strategy prioritizes maximizing the payoff in the last round, considering both individual payoff and resource preservation for future games. If resources are abundant (stock > 2n), ARSS will defect to maximize individual payoff; otherwise, it will cooperate to ensure resource sustainability.
     Pseudocode: if r == 1 then return if (stock <= 2n) then C else D

3. Be collective:
   - ARSS is designed with a collective mindset that prioritizes long-term sustainability of the common pool resource, aiming for cooperation when possible while ensuring individual survival in the short term.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build a foundation of trust with other players (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, adapt behavior based on opponent's actions in the previous round:
       - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate again (C) to reward cooperation and maintain trust.
       - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to punish their action (D). This response signals disapproval of defection while still taking resources from the common pool.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions as the game ends shortly (C).
   - If an opponent defects for the first time after initially cooperating, defect in response but revert to cooperating in subsequent rounds unless they continue to defect. This shows forgiveness and promotes cooperation if opponents change their behavior.

3. Be collective:
   - Prioritize maintaining the common stock level at a sustainable level that is beneficial for all players in the long run.
   - Cooperate as much as possible with other players to encourage cooperation, but also respond appropriately when necessary to punish defection and preserve resources.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperation (C): Mimic opponents' actions from the previous round, fostering a cooperative environment. If it's the first round, always cooperate.
   - Defection (D): If an opponent defected in the last encounter, retaliate with defection; otherwise, cooperate.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(history, current_state, capacity, n):

  if opponent_action == 'D': # retaliate with defection
    return 'D'
  else: # cooperate to maintain a cooperative environment
    return 'C'
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, there is no history, so always cooperate as mentioned earlier.
   - At the last round (r), it's essential to consider that players may try to "tit-for-tat" by defection in response to a previous defection. However, since the goal is to maximize payoffs over all rounds, we should switch back to cooperation to preserve the resource for future interactions:

```
function ATFT(history, current_state, capacity, n, r):
  if history.size == 0: # first round
    return 'C'
  elif history.size == r-1: # last round
    return 'C' # switch back to cooperation for the final round

    if opponent_action == 'D': # retaliate with defection
      return 'D'
    else:
      return 'C'

3. Be collective:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy is inherently aligned with a collective mindset, as it encourages players to cooperate when opponents do so and retaliates only if they defect, fostering long-term cooperation and resource preservation. This collective approach seeks to build trust among the participants in repeated interactions.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative relationship and show goodwill.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior from the previous round and adopt the following decision rules:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate in the current round as well, encouraging continued cooperation.
     - If the opponent defected in the last round, defect in the current round to punish their actions and encourage them to reconsider their strategy. However, if the common pool resource is below a critical threshold (stock < (2n-1) * capacity / r), cooperate to help recover the stock level and maintain a chance for future cooperation.
     - If the opponent's previous action cannot be determined due to missing data or other issues, cooperate as a default strategy to encourage cooperation and avoid potential negative consequences.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing personal payoff regardless of the opponent's previous actions since the game is ending soon.
   - In the first round, if the common pool resource level is below a minimum threshold (stock < capacity / n), defect to help preserve resources for future rounds.
   - If the common pool resource reaches zero during any round, wait for the game administrator to replenish it before making decisions.

3. Collective Mindset:

      - If opponent cooperated, reciprocate cooperation to maintain a beneficial partnership. (Cooperate if Opponent Cooperated)
      - If opponent defected, defect to punish overconsumption and encourage future cooperation. (Defect if Opponent Defected)
   - To account for the possibility of "tit-for-two-tats" (opponent retaliates after defecting), introduce a forgiveness mechanism:
      - After defection, forgive opponent if they cooperate in the following round (i.e., cooperate even if Opponent Defected in the last two rounds and then Cooperated this round). (Cooperate if Opponent Defected in Last Two Rounds but Cooperated This Round)
   - Adapt to opponents that do not follow a standard TFT pattern by gradually increasing tolerance for defections over time. (Increase Tolerance Over Time)

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of opponent's behavior to maximize accumulated payoff. (Cooperate in Last Round)
   - If an opponent defects and does not cooperate in the next round, consider them uncooperative and adopt a tougher stance. (Defect after repeated defections)

   - Last round: Adopt the same decision rules as described in the main strategy, ensuring a final decision that aligns with the overall approach of ATFT.
   - Initial stock depletion scenarios: The strategy will still follow the initial cooperative action rule even if the initial stock is lower than the capacity, given the resource's growth factor.

3. Be collective:
   - By adopting a consistent pattern of reciprocity and encouraging cooperation among opponents, ATFT aims to maximize the overall well-being of all players while preserving the common pool resource for future rounds.
   - The strategy assumes that other players will also adopt similar decision rules and follow the common knowledge assumption, promoting collective interests through reciprocal behavior.

 For this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy named "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)". The strategy is inspired by the classic "Tit for Tat" strategy but with adaptations to account for dynamic stock levels and improved robustness to opponent behaviors.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (foster goodwill and cooperation)
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if opponents cooperated in the previous round; otherwise defect (retaliate against defection while still prioritizing cooperation)
   - If the current stock level is below a predefined threshold (e.g., 2n), always defect to prevent further depletion of resources

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(i, t, state, history):
    if t == 1: # First round, cooperate
        return 'C'

    previous_action = history[t-1][i]
    current_stock = state.stock

    if current_stock < 2*n: # Resource depletion threshold
        return 'D'
    elif previous_action == 'C': # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
        return 'C'
    else: # Defect if opponent defected last round
        return 'D'
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize cooperating to leave as much stock for future players (since there will be no more growth after this round)
   - If history is empty in the first round, assume other players also cooperate in their first move (to foster cooperation)

3. Be collective:
   - The ATFT strategy encourages cooperation among players to sustain the common pool resource for future rounds while also punishing defection when necessary
   - By adapting to the current state of the game, it maintains a collective mindset by considering both the stock level and opponents' past actions before deciding on an action

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C) to demonstrate trust and encourage cooperation from other players.
   - Subsequent Rounds: If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C). If the opponent defected, defect (D) as a punishment for their uncooperative behavior in the previous round. After defection, the AI will wait for the opponent to return to cooperation before resuming cooperation itself.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First Round: Cooperate as mentioned above.
   - Last Round and Low Stock Levels (stock ≤ n): Due to limited resources or nearing the end of the game, it is more beneficial to defect to secure personal gains, even if this might harm the common pool. However, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, still cooperate as a goodwill gesture.
   - High Stock Levels (stock > n): In situations where there's an abundance of resources, cooperation remains the preferred action since it benefits both the AI and the common pool.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:
   - Throughout the game, the primary focus is on maintaining a sustainable common stock level for future rounds while maximizing individual payoffs. The strategy encourages cooperation to build trust and foster a sense of collective responsibility. However, it also punishes defection to deter long-term exploitation and promote fair resource distribution.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(opponent_history, stock, n, r, capacity) {
  if (t == 1) return 'C' // Cooperate in the first round
  previous_action = opponent_history[t-1]

  if (previous_action == 'C') return 'C' // Cooperation after cooperation
  else if (stock <= n) return 'D' // Defect when resources are scarce or nearing end of game
  else if (stock > capacity / (2n)) return 'C' // Cooperate when there is an abundance of resources
  else return 'D' // Defect as a punishment for opponent's previous defection
}
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to demonstrate cooperation and goodwill. This might encourage others to cooperate as well.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate your opponent's actions from the previous round and respond accordingly with the same action they took against you (i.e., if an opponent C'd, reciprocate with C; if an opponent D'd, reciprocate with D). This encourages cooperation but also punishes defection.
   - If an opponent has been consistently cooperative or defective, maintain the same action in response to keep the game going and encourage continued cooperation (i.e., don't retaliate endlessly for continuous defection, as it may lead to a spiral of mutual defection; similarly, don't keep cooperating indefinitely when an opponent always defects).
   - Introduce forgiveness after periods of continuous defection by the opponent (e.g., if an opponent has only defected for the last 'f' rounds and was previously cooperative, switch to cooperation). This allows for rebuilding trust and encouraging future cooperation.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate unconditionally (C).
   - In the last round, cooperate if opponent has been cooperating in recent rounds; defect otherwise (punish opponents who have consistently defected throughout the game).
   - If the stock reaches zero during any round, end the game since there is no more resource to consume. The payoff for that round would be based on the accumulated stock depletion up until that point.
   - After defection by an opponent, allow 'd' rounds of forgiveness before switching to defection in response, where d is a constant defined based on trial-and-error or other learning mechanisms during the training process.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy prioritizes long-term cooperation over short-term gains to foster a collaborative environment and maximize the common pool resource for all players.
   - By punishing defection and forgiving past transgressions, the ATFT strategy encourages opponents to cooperate and promotes collective interests.
  
Pseudocode:
```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, stock, history) {
  if (round == 1) return "C"; // Cooperate in the first round

  opponent_history = filterHistory(history, selfIndex); // Get opponent's actions

  last_opponent_action = opponent_history[opponent_history.length - 1];

  if (last_opponent_action == "C" && history.length > d) { // d is a forgiveness period
    return "C"; // Cooperate if opponent has been cooperative recently
  } else if (last_opponent_action == "D") {
    return "D"; // Defect if opponent defected in the last round
  } else {
    return "C"; // Cooperate by default to encourage cooperation
  }

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate (C). This is an initial gesture of goodwill to encourage cooperation from others.
   - From the second round (t>1) until the last round (t=r), observe and respond to the opponents' previous actions:
      - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (C). This maintains the existing pattern of cooperation.
      - If opponent defected in the previous round, also defect in the current round (D). This is a punishment for defection and an incentive to return to cooperation.
   - In the last round (t=r), cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action as there are no further rounds to punish or reward.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In case of missing history, start by cooperating (C) in the first round and then follow the aforementioned decision rules.
   - If an opponent defects in the final round (t=r), it is no longer beneficial to punish them, so continue cooperating (C).

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy promotes cooperation and fairness by reciprocating others' actions. It encourages a collective mindset as players are more likely to stick with those who have been cooperative. This can lead to a sustainable stock level in the long run, benefiting all players.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tit_for_tat(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if t == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in first round
  elif t < r:
    if history[-1] == 'C':
      action = 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
    else:
      action = 'D'  # Defect if opponent defected last round
  else:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the final round

  return action
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The ATFT strategy is designed to promote cooperation while being robust to various opponent behaviors. Initially, it cooperates in the first round and subsequently copies the last action of the opponent from the previous round. If the opponent has been cooperative (C), ATFT continues to cooperate; if not, it defects (D) until the opponent switches back to cooperation.

Pseudocode for decision rule:
```
function getAction(opponentHistory):
  if round == 1:
    return "C"  # Cooperate in first round
  else:
    lastOpponentAction = opponentHistory[-1]
    if lastOpponentAction == "C":
      return "C"  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
    else:
      return "D"  # Defect if opponent defected last round
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

ATFT is already designed to address the first-round issue by cooperating initially. For the last round, ATFT continues with its current decision rule since the strategy focuses on long-term cooperation and does not explicitly consider the final round as a special case.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

By promoting cooperation, the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy encourages all players to work together towards maintaining a sustainable common pool resource. The strategy aims for mutual benefit by fostering trust and reciprocity among players, which are crucial components of collective success in this game.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (ATFSG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, the ATFSG player cooperates (plays C) if the current stock level is above a certain threshold (defined as T). Otherwise, it defects (plays D). The threshold T is initially set to n/2 and is dynamically adjusted based on the history of actions taken by other players.
   - If all players have cooperated in the past 'c' consecutive rounds, then T increases linearly towards the maximum capacity until it reaches a peak value P1. This encourages cooperation as the stock grows.
   - If any player has defected during the last 'd' consecutive rounds, then T decreases linearly towards n/2 to ensure fairness and prevent overexploitation of the common pool.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, ATFSG cooperates since there is no history to base decisions on. However, it starts tracking the actions of other players.
   - In the last round, ATFSG evaluates its threshold T based on the current state and adjusts accordingly for future games, if any.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - ATFSG encourages cooperation by following a "fair" strategy that responds to other players' actions. It rewards cooperative behavior through higher stock growth when all players contribute equally (T increases) and punishes defection by reducing the stock growth threshold (T decreases).

Pseudocode:

```python
class ATFSG:
    def __init__(self, capacity, n, r, c, d, P1):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.n = n
        self.r = r
        self.c = c  # number of consecutive cooperative rounds for T increase
        self.d = d  # number of consecutive defection rounds for T decrease
        self.P1 = P1  # peak threshold value
        self.T = n / 2  # initial threshold
        self.history = defaultdict(int)  # store history of actions by each player

    def decide_action(self, stock, players_actions):
        self.update_history(players_actions)

        if len(self.history) < (self.c + self.d):
            return 'C' if stock > self.T else 'D'  # initial threshold and adjustment based on current stock level

        cooperative_count = sum(self.history[player] for player, action in players_actions if action == 'C')
        defection_count = sum(self.history[player] for player, action in players_actions if action == 'D')

        # Adjust threshold based on history
        if cooperative_count >= self.c and defection_count <= self.d:
            self.T += (self.P1 - self.T) * (cooperative_count / self.c)
        elif defection_count > self.d:
            self.T -= (self.T - n / 2) * (defection_count / self.d)

        return 'C' if stock > self.T else 'D'

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate (play C) to establish trust and avoid depleting the common resource excessively.
   - After the first round, adapt behaviour based on opponent's actions in previous rounds:
     - If the opponent cooperates, continue cooperating. This builds trust and encourages future cooperation.
     - If the opponent defects, also defect in the following round to punish their selfish behavior. After punishing, revert back to cooperative mode. This strategy is forgiving, encouraging opponents to return to cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): If the common resource has been depleted, do not consume any more as there is no stock left for further consumption. If the common resource still remains, continue cooperating if the opponent did so in the previous round; otherwise, defect to punish the opponent.
   - First Encounter with an Opponent (new players joining): Cooperate in the first encounter to encourage cooperation and establish trust. After this encounter, follow the standard ATFT decision rules.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The primary focus is on maintaining a sustainable common resource while encouraging cooperation among opponents. By being flexible and responsive to opponent actions, the strategy aims to foster cooperation and prevent excessive depletion of the common resource.

Pseudocode for the ATFT strategy:

```python
def Adaptive_Tit_for_Tat(r, history):
  if t == 1:
    action = 'C' # Cooperate in the first round

  else:
    if opponent_action_history[t-1] == 'C': # Opponent cooperated in the previous round
      action = 'C' # Cooperate in this round
    elif opponent_action_history[t-1] == 'D': # Opponent defected in the previous round
      if t != r: # If it's not the last round, defect to punish
        action = 'D'
      else: # If it is the last round and there's still resource left, cooperate regardless of opponent's action
        if resource > 0:
          action = 'C'

return action # Return chosen action for current round
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_566 = '''
 In this game, I propose a strategic approach called "Adaptive Fitness-based Tit-for-Tat" (AFTfT). The AFTfT strategy is designed to foster cooperation and robustness against various opponent behaviors while maintaining adaptability in different game scenarios.

1. Decision rules:
   - Initial round (t=1): Cooperate, as the initial stock is at its maximum capacity. This encourages others to cooperate, as doing so would result in a higher payoff for all players in the first round.
     ```
     if t == 1:
         action = 'C' (Cooperate)
     ```
   - Remaining rounds: Adopt a Tit-for-Tat strategy with an added adaptive fitness component. This allows AFTfT to learn from opponent behavior and adjust its actions accordingly while preserving the cooperative nature of Tit-for-Tat.
       - If opponents cooperate, continue cooperating.
         ```
         if previous_round_payoff > average_previous_round_payoff:
             action = 'C' (Cooperate)
         ```
       - If opponents have been defecting and the current round payoff would be higher by defecting compared to the average of the previous rounds, defect. This is a punitive response aimed at encouraging cooperation from opponents.
         ```
         if previous_round_payoff < average_previous_round_payoff and (action == 'D'):
             action = 'D' (Defect)
         ```
       - If opponents have been defecting, but the current round payoff would be lower by defecting compared to the average of the previous rounds, cooperate. This demonstrates a willingness to forgive and potentially rebuild cooperation.
         ```
         if previous_round_payoff < average_previous_round_payoff and (action != 'D'):
             action = 'C' (Cooperate)
         ```
   - Last round: Since the game ends after r rounds, AFTfT will adopt a Tit-for-Tat approach in the last round. This encourages cooperation and ensures that AFTfT does not end the game with a punitive response.
     ```
     if t == r:
         action = 'C' (Cooperate)
     ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Empty stock (S=0): In this situation, no consumption is possible, and there is no growth or new stock calculation needed. AFTfT will continue to follow the decision rules for the remaining rounds.
   - Out-of-bounds stock levels: If the stock level exceeds the capacity or falls below 0 due to an error or unforeseen circumstances, AFTfT will reset the stock level to the capacity (if it's above) or 0 (if it's below). This ensures that the game can continue even in unusual situations.
     ```
     if S > capacity:
         S = capacity
     elif S < 0:
         S = 0
     ```

3. Be collective: AFTfT is designed to foster cooperation and promote a collective mindset. By cooperating whenever possible, AFTfT encourages others to do the same. Additionally, AFTfT adjusts its actions based on the group's performance in previous rounds, allowing it to learn from the collective behavior of other players and respond accordingly. This adaptive fitness component ensures that AFTfT remains aligned with the collective interest while being robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

In summary, AFTfT is an adaptive and robust strategy designed for the Common Pool Resource Game. It combines elements of Tit-for-Tat with an added fitness component to foster cooperation, learn from opponent behavior, and adjust actions accordingly while maintaining a collective mindset. The strategy is also designed to handle edge cases and ensure that the game can continue even in unusual situations.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round and when stock is above 50%, cooperate (C). This encourages cooperation and resource preservation.
   - In subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate. If the opponent defected, defect as well. This fosters reciprocity and avoids being taken advantage of.
   - Modify the strategy to become more forgiving when the stock is low (below 50%). In this case, players should prioritize cooperation to prevent the collapse of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATFT(opponent_action_history, stock, round, capacity):
  if round == 1 or stock > capacity/2:
    return "C" # Cooperate

  if opponent_action_history[-1] == "C":
    return "C" # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
  else:
    if stock < capacity/2:
      return "C" # Cooperate when stock is low
    else:
      return "D" # Defect if opponent defected last round
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize cooperation as it might impact long-term reputation and future interactions with opponents.
   - In case of an empty opponent_action_history (first interaction), default to cooperating in the initial round and then proceed according to decision rules.

3. Be Collective:
   - By encouraging cooperation, especially when resource levels are high or low, ATFT fosters a collective mindset that prioritizes the sustainability of the common pool resource for the benefit of all players over time.
   - The strategy's adaptiveness allows it to respond flexibly to different opponent behaviors while maintaining its commitment to reciprocity and resource conservation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_568 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Resource Tit-for-Tat (ARTFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, compare the average consumption rate over the last three rounds with a threshold value calculated as the maximum sustainable consumption level without depleting the resource (i.e., capacity / (2n)). If the current consumption rate is below the threshold, cooperate; otherwise defect. The consumption rate can be estimated by dividing the total consumption over the past three rounds by 3.
   - In the first round, players should cooperate as there is no history to analyze.
   - In case of a depleted resource (stock = 0), players should stop playing and report a loss in that round.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, players will not be able to affect the stock level for future rounds; thus, they should follow the decision rule based on the past three rounds' consumption rate as usual.
   - For the first few rounds, if the consumption rate is not established yet (e.g., only a couple of rounds have passed), players can cooperate initially and gradually adapt to the opponents' behavior.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The ARTFT strategy encourages cooperation as long as the resource is being used sustainably by all participants, but it retaliates against excessive consumption by defecting in response. This approach fosters a collective mindset where players cooperate when others do so, but punish those who exploit the common resource.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ARTFT(n, capacity, r, stock, round):
  consumption_history = []
  strategy = "C"  # default to cooperating

  if round == 1:
    strategy = "C"  # cooperate in the first round

  for i in range(round - 1, max(0, round - 3)):
    consumption_history.append(stock[i + 1] - stock[i])

  avg_consumption = sum(consumption_history[-3:]) / 3
  threshold = capacity / (2 * n)

  if avg_consumption > threshold:
    strategy = "D"  # defect when the consumption rate exceeds the threshold

  return strategy

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, the TFT-A strategy will first assess whether it has been cooperating more than defecting in the previous rounds (Coop > Defect). If Coop > Defect, TFT-A will Cooperate; otherwise, it will Defect. This rule promotes cooperation if the history indicates that cooperation is reciprocated but can switch to defection if there's a history of betrayal.
   - To minimize initial hesitation and promote cooperative beginnings, TFT-A will Cooperate in the first round and last round (round r).

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, regardless of past behavior, TFT-A will Cooperate.
   - In the last round (r), TFT-A will Cooperate even if Coop > Defect because the game ends after this round.
   - If there is no history (i.e., it's the first time playing with a new opponent), TFT-A will Cooperate in the first round as a default cooperative gesture.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - By following these decision rules, TFT-A maintains a balance between cooperation and defection while retaining the ability to punish betrayal and reward reciprocity, promoting a collective mindset that favors sustained cooperation in the common pool resource game.

Pseudocode for TFT-A:
```
Strategy TFT_A(round, history):
  if round == 1 or round == r:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, players Cooperate (C). This is a peaceful gesture to establish trust and encourages cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - In each subsequent round, players will mirror the previous opponent's action from the previous round (Tit-for-Tat). If the opponent cooperated, players will also cooperate; if the opponent defected, players will defect as well.
   - To account for opponents who may not follow the standard Tit-for-Tat strategy, we introduce an element of forgiveness: after three consecutive defections from an opponent, a player will revert to cooperating again in hopes that the opponent will resume cooperation. This approach aims to balance punishing defectors with maintaining the potential for future cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Players should Cooperate (C) since there are no more rounds and the goal is to maximize individual payoffs in this final opportunity.
   - Almost Empty Stock (Stock ≤ n): In this critical state, players will switch to a more conservative approach and always Defect (D). This is to ensure that the stock level doesn't deplete entirely, as the game dynamics imply that a zero stock results in no growth, thus leading to a disadvantageous situation for all players.
   - First Round: Players Cooperate (C) as mentioned earlier.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - The core idea behind this strategy is to maintain long-term cooperation by punishing defection and offering forgiveness, fostering an environment where mutual trust can develop among players. This approach promotes the collective interest of sustaining the common pool resource for future rounds while ensuring individual payoffs are maximized.

description_COLLECTIVE_571 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round, the ATFT strategy starts by cooperating (playing action C). If a player has encountered a cooperative partner for the previous r/2 rounds, they will continue cooperating. However, if a non-cooperative action (D) was played by any player in the last r/2 rounds, the strategy will defect (play action D) in the current round. This is designed to encourage cooperation but also punish defection.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(round, history) {
  if (length(history) == 0 || round <= r/2) { // First half of rounds or no history yet
    return 'C'; // Cooperate
  }

  previous_cooperation = countCooperativeActionsInHistory(history, r/2);

  if (previous_cooperation >= r/2) { // Cooperation from the last r/2 rounds
    return 'C'; // Cooperate
  } else { // Non-cooperative action in the last r/2 rounds
    return 'D'; // Defect
  }
}
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
In the first round, there is no history, so the strategy starts by cooperating. In the last round, the strategy looks back at r/2 rounds to determine whether to cooperate or defect based on the decision rules above. Since the strategy assumes repeated interaction and relies on a history of interactions, it does not handle scenarios where the game may end prematurely before reaching the specified number of rounds (r).

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
The ATFT strategy is designed to foster cooperation among players by starting cooperatively and only defecting when faced with defection from others. It encourages long-term collaboration while also punishing short-term selfishness, promoting a shared understanding of fairness and reciprocity. This approach aims to benefit the collective group over time.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_572 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative-Competitive (ACC) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, the ACC strategy evaluates the current state of the game and chooses to cooperate or defect based on a weighted combination of cooperation and self-interest. The weights are determined by factors such as the current stock level, number of rounds played so far, and the history of opponent behaviors.
   - To calculate the weight for cooperation (w_c), we can use the following formula: w_c = min(1 - ((stock / capacity) * 0.5), 1). This formula ensures that players are more likely to cooperate when the stock level is low and less likely to do so when it approaches the maximum sustainable stock level.
   - To calculate the weight for self-interest (w_si), we can use a simple moving average of past payoffs, such as the exponentially smoothed moving average: w_si = α * payoff + (1 - α) * w_si_{prev}, where 0 < α < 1 is a smoothing factor. This formula allows the strategy to adapt to different opponent behaviors over time and encourages players to be less cooperative if they are not receiving sufficient rewards for their efforts.
   - In each round, the ACC strategy chooses an action based on the calculated weights: if w_c > w_si, the player chooses to cooperate; otherwise, they choose to defect.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Players should choose their actions based solely on the current stock level, as there is no history of opponent behaviors to consider. In this case, if the weight for cooperation (w_c) is greater than or equal to 0.5, players should cooperate; otherwise, they should defect.
   - Last Round: Players should prioritize their own payoff in the last round, as there are no future rounds to consider. In this case, players will choose to defect if w_si > w_c and cooperate otherwise.

3. Being Collective:
   - Although the ACC strategy is individualistic by design, it encourages cooperation by rewarding players when the stock level is low and penalizing them when it approaches the maximum sustainable level. This collective mindset helps maintain the resource for future use while ensuring that each player maximizes their own payoff.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative-Competitive Algorithm (ACCA) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   ACCA employs a Tit-for-Tat approach with an added element of adaptability to foster cooperation and minimize stock depletion. The main rule is:
   - If the majority of players cooperate in the previous round, player i cooperates (C) in the current round.
   - If less than 50% of players cooperated in the previous round, player i defects (D). However, if the current stock level is below a certain threshold (see edge cases), player i may choose to cooperate to prevent rapid depletion.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First Round: All players cooperate to ensure maximum collective benefit and a stable initial stock level.
   - Last Round: Players follow the majority rule from the previous round, considering any possible coordination failures or emerging strategies during the game.
   - Stock Threshold: If the current stock level falls below (capacity * 0.8), players prioritize cooperation regardless of the majority rule to prevent rapid depletion.

3. Be collective:
   ACCA is designed with a collective mindset, encouraging sustained cooperation and avoiding excessive competition that could lead to resource depletion. By following the majority rule and adapting to opponent behaviors, the strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment while maintaining resilience against various strategies.

Pseudocode:
```
function ACCA(n, r, capacity, stock, round) {
  if (round == 1) return 'C' // Cooperate in the first round

  majority = countCooperatorsInPreviousRound(n)

  if (majority > n/2) return 'C' // If most players cooperated, cooperate
  else if (stock < capacity * 0.8) return 'C' // If stock is low, prioritize cooperation
  else return 'D' // Otherwise, defect
}

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C), setting a cooperative tone and demonstrating a willingness to collaborate initially.
   - Ongoing Rounds (t>1):
       - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in this round (i.e., reciprocate cooperation).
       - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in this round (i.e., punish defection).
   - Last Round (t=r): Cooperate to conserve resources for future potential interactions.

2. Edge Cases:
   - First Round (t=1): As mentioned above, cooperate (C) as a friendly gesture.
   - Last Round (t=r): Since the interaction ends in this round, cooperate to maximize individual payoff in the final stages of the game.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - ATfT strategy aims for long-term cooperation while punishing defection in a simple yet robust manner that encourages reciprocity among players. The strategy promotes mutual respect and builds trust over time, aligning with collective interests by preserving resources and ensuring sustainable exploitation of the common pool.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    if t == 1:
        action = "C" (Cooperate)
    else:
        previous_action = history[t-1]
        if previous_action == "C":
            action = "C"
        elif previous_action == "D":
            action = "D"
    return action
```

By adopting the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy, the AI player will be able to maintain a balance between cooperation and competition while promoting collective interests in the Common Pool Resource Game. The simplicity of the strategy allows it to be easily understood and adapted by other AI systems participating in the tournament.

description_COLLECTIVE_575 = '''
 For this Common Pool Resource Game, we'll design a strategy named "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat" (A-TFT). A-TFT is a cooperative strategy inspired by Robert Axelrod's original Tit-for-Tat in the Prisoner's Dilemma game. It aims to maintain long-term cooperation while being responsive to opponent behavior.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, A-TFT will cooperate (C). This sets a friendly initial tone and gives opponents an opportunity to cooperate.
   - After the first round, observe the actions of all other players and assign them a cooperation score:
     - If another player cooperates, their cooperation score is set to 1.
     - If another player defects, their cooperation score is set to -1.
     - If a player does not play (e.g., due to edge cases), ignore them for this round's score calculation.
   - In subsequent rounds, A-TFT will cooperate if the average cooperation score of all opponents in the previous round was greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, it defects.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round (r), A-TFT will continue to play according to the average cooperation score calculated from rounds 1 to r-1. This ensures that a player does not suddenly shift strategy in an attempt to manipulate payoffs at the end of the game.
   - In the first round, if any opponent fails to make a move (e.g., due to a bug or other unforeseen circumstances), A-TFT will also cooperate and consider that opponent as having a cooperation score of 1 for that round. This encourages future cooperation once the game progresses.
   - If multiple opponents fail to make a move in the first round, A-TFT will assume they are cooperating and assign them a cooperation score of 1.

3. Be collective:
   - A-TFT maintains a long-term commitment to cooperation but is flexible enough to respond to changes in opponent behavior. It emphasizes fairness and reciprocity, which are essential for collaboration and building trust among players.
   - By considering the average cooperation score of all opponents rather than focusing on individual behaviors, A-TFT promotes a more collective approach that encourages harmony and mutual understanding within the player group.

Pseudocode:
```
strategy = "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat"
r, n, capacity = game_parameters
cooperation_scores = [0 for i in range(n)]

def first_round():
  action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

def last_round():
  return cooperation_score_average()  # Use average from previous rounds in the last round

def play_round(opponent_actions):
  for i in range(n):
    if opponent_i_action is not None:  # Handle edge cases where an opponent does not make a move
      if opponent_i_action == "C":
        cooperation_scores[i] = max(cooperation_scores[i], 1)
      elif opponent_i_action == "D":
        cooperation_scores[i] = min(cooperation_scores[i], -1)

  average_cooperation_score = sum(cooperation_scores) / n

  if average_cooperation_score >= 0:
    action = "C"  # Cooperate when the average cooperation score is positive or equal to 0
  else:
    action = "D"  # Defect when the average cooperation score is negative

  return action
```

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation-Based Resource Allocation (ACRA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): ACRA starts by cooperating to build a strong initial stock level, as it has no prior information about the opponents' strategies. (action = C)
   - Remaining Rounds (t>1): ACRA determines its action based on the following conditions:
     - If the current stock level is above 50% of the capacity (i.e., stock > capacity / 2), ACRA cooperates to maintain and grow the stock, ensuring a higher payoff for all players in the long run. (action = C)
     - If the current stock level is below or equal to 50% of the capacity (i.e., stock <= capacity / 2), ACRA defects to protect against depleting the common pool and ensure a minimum level of resources for the next rounds. (action = D)
   - In case of a tie in stock level, ACRA randomly chooses between cooperating or defecting.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): If the current stock level is sufficient to guarantee a payoff greater than or equal to the average payoff achieved so far, ACRA cooperates to maximize the final payoff. Otherwise, it defects to ensure some level of resources for future games.
   - First Round (t=1) and other rounds with insufficient information: ACRA cooperates to facilitate cooperation among players in subsequent rounds.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - ACRA is designed to promote cooperation among players by prioritizing the collective interest when possible, while also considering self-interest in scenarios where the common pool is at risk of depletion. This approach aims to strike a balance between collaboration and competition, fostering sustainable resource management for all players.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to show goodwill and encourage cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from the previous round:
     a) If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round.
     b) If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round as retaliation for overconsumption.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   a) In the first round, cooperate regardless of opponents' actions since it is an initial gesture to foster cooperation.
   b) In the last round, evaluate opponent's past actions and act accordingly:
     i) If opponent has consistently cooperated, cooperate as well to end on a positive note.
     ii) If opponent has defected, also defect to ensure fairness and preserve resources for future games.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Prioritize long-term sustainability of the common pool resource by minimizing stock depletion in each round while considering opponents' actions.
   - Encourage cooperation among opponents by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defection through adaptive tit-for-tat retaliation.
   - Contribute to maintaining a healthy and growing stock level, ensuring the game can continue for multiple rounds while preserving resources.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    strategy = {}
    strategy['cooperate'] = 1  # default cooperation in first round
    strategy['last_round'] = False  # not the last round yet

    for t=1 to r:  # each round
        if t=1:  # first round, cooperate regardless of opponents' actions
            strategy[t] = 'cooperate'
        else:
            if history[t-1]['opponent_action'] == 'cooperate':  # opponent cooperated last round
                strategy[t] = 'cooperate'  # cooperate this round
            elif history[t-1]['opponent_action'] == 'defect':  # opponent defected last round
                strategy[t] = 'defect'  # defect this round as retaliation

        # Calculate payoffs for current round (π_i, t) based on the state and strategy
        ...

        # Update history with the current action and payoff
        history[t] = {'opponent_action': strategy[t], 'payoff': π_i, t}

        # Check if it's the last round
        if (t+1) == r:
            strategy['last_round'] = True

    # Calculate total game payoff for player i over r rounds
    Σ(t=1 to r) π_i, t
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_578 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Preservation (ASP) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - ASP cooperates when the remaining stock level is above the threshold of "critical depletion" (CD), and defects otherwise. The critical depletion threshold is a dynamically updated value based on the current round, total player count, and maximum sustainable stock capacity.

   Pseudocode for Critical Depletion Threshold calculation:
   ```
   function CD_threshold(n, r, capacity) {
       return (capacity - n) / capacity * (r / (r + 1))
   }
   ```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, ASP cooperates because there is no critical depletion yet.
   - In the last round, ASP defects if the remaining stock reaches the CD threshold, and cooperates otherwise to maximize its payoff from the final round.

3. Be Collective:
   - ASP aims to balance self-interest with collective wellbeing by prioritizing long-term sustainability of the common pool resource while still ensuring individual needs are met. This is achieved through adaptive cooperation based on the CD threshold, which adjusts dynamically as the game progresses and accounts for the impact of past actions on future stock levels.

Pseudocode for ASP strategy:
```
function ASP(n, r, capacity, round, remaining_stock) {
    if (round == 1) {
        return 'Cooperate'
    }

    CD_threshold = CD_threshold(n, r, capacity)

    if (remaining_stock > CD_threshold * remaining_stock) {
        return 'Cooperate'
    } else {
        return 'Defect'
    }
}
```

This strategy strikes a balance between cooperation and defection based on the current state of the common pool resource, aiming to preserve it for future rounds while also maximizing individual payoffs. ASP is adaptive and robust as it updates its critical depletion threshold dynamically throughout the game and does not rely on any specific coordination mechanisms or assumptions about other players' strategies.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a gesture of goodwill and sets a cooperative tone.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, also defect. This encourages reciprocity and maintains a stable relationship with the opponent.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, since the game ends regardless of the actions taken, cooperate to maximize payoff.
   - In the initial and penultimate rounds, follow the TFT decision rule as described above.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - The TFT strategy promotes a collective mindset by fostering mutual cooperation when both players adopt this strategy. This approach incentivizes players to maintain the common pool resource for future rounds, ensuring sustainable long-term growth and maximizing total payoff over multiple games.

Pseudocode for Tit-for-Tat Strategy:

```
function TFT(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, round, opponent_action):
    if round == 1:
        action = "C" (Cooperate)

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-based Tit-for-Tat (ASTFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate to show a peaceful intention. This encourages other players to cooperate initially as well. (C)
   - If the stock level after consumption is above the threshold (stock_threshold), cooperate to promote sustainable resource use and encourage cooperation from opponents. (C if stock > stock_threshold)
   - If the stock level after consumption is below the warning threshold (stock_warning), defect to protect the common pool resource and penalize opponents who do not follow the collective mindset. (D if stock < stock_warning)
   - In all other cases, mimic the action of the most cooperative opponent from the previous round (i.e., highest number of cooperative actions). This encourages opponents to reciprocate cooperation and promotes long-term sustainable resource management. (Mimic the most cooperative opponent from last round)

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, always cooperate as mentioned before.
   - In the last round, mimic the most cooperative opponent from the previous round to ensure a positive outcome regardless of opponents' strategies.
   - If an opponent defects when you are cooperating and the stock level drops below the warning threshold, switch to defection for the next round to punish the defector and encourage future cooperation.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Always prioritize the long-term sustainability of the common pool resource over individual short-term gains.
   - Encourage other players to cooperate through reciprocal behavior, adapting to their actions and penalizing defectors when necessary.
   - Contribute to building a stable collective by maintaining a balance between cooperation and punishment, promoting sustainable resource management, and encouraging opponents to follow the shared goal of resource preservation.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   A-TfT starts by cooperating in the first round (C). In subsequent rounds, the strategy will mimic its opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, A-TfT also cooperates; if the opponent defected, A-TfT defects.
   Pseudocode:
   ```
   if round == 1:

   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   A-TfT treats all rounds equally regardless of their order or position within the game.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   A-TfT promotes cooperation by reciprocating it, but also punishes defection to encourage fairness and long-term collaboration among players. The strategy is designed to establish trust through its initial cooperative moves while also being robust against frequent defection from opponents.
   In addition, A-TfT can be modified to include a forgiveness factor (e.g., allowing a certain number of defects before punishing the opponent), which further emphasizes cooperation and helps avoid cycles of retaliation.

Pseudocode for a version with forgiveness:
```
for round = 1 to r:
    if round == 1 or round < forgiveness_limit:

        elif number_of_previous_defections < forgiveness_limit:
            action = "C" (Cooperate)
        else:
            action = "D" (Defect)
```
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_582 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, cooperate initially (play C). This sets a cooperative tone and signals good faith to other players.
   - If a player has been cooperating with another player in the previous rounds, continue to cooperate in the current round (if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, respond with cooperation; if they defected, respond with defection in the next round). This encourages reciprocity and punishes defections.
   - If a player has been defecting for the past few rounds, continue to respond with defection until the opponent starts cooperating again (continue defecting as long as the opponent is defecting; switch back to cooperation if the opponent cooperates). This discourages continuous defections but also allows for forgiveness and reinforces the possibility of future cooperation.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate, as this is a fresh start, and it sets a cooperative tone.
   - Last Round: Cooperate if the opponent has been cooperating, defect if the opponent has been defecting. This encourages reciprocity even in the final round and rewards past cooperation.

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain a history of past interactions with each opponent for up to 'k' (predefined number of recent rounds) to make decisions.
   - By responding to other players based on their past behavior, ATFT attempts to build and maintain trust, promote cooperation, and foster a collective mindset among the players. It does not rely on predetermined patterns or coordination mechanisms but instead encourages emergent cooperation through reciprocity.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) with Stock Growth Consideration (SG-ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially cooperate in the first round to contribute positively to the common pool and establish trust (C).
   - In subsequent rounds, observe other players' actions from the previous round. If all players cooperated, continue to cooperate (C). If any player defected, also defect in the current round as retaliation (D). This encourages cooperation while maintaining robustness against defection.
   - To take stock growth into account, adjust the decision rule: if the new stock after consumption grows by more than 20% of its original value (i.e., growth > 20% × capacity / n), return to cooperating regardless of previous actions (C). This helps players rebuild trust when the common pool is depleting too quickly, allowing for a second chance at cooperation.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there will be no further rounds to retaliate or benefit from cooperation, simply cooperate regardless of other players' actions (C). This allows for a positive outcome even in the final stage of the game.
   - In case the stock depletion is causing negative growth (i.e., growth < 0), do not allow the new stock to be below zero, but instead set it to zero. This ensures that the common pool cannot go into debt and prevents the game from breaking down due to mathematical impossibilities.

3. Be Collective:
   - The collective mindset is embedded in the strategy by promoting cooperation and considering the impact of individual actions on the common pool. By encouraging mutual cooperation, the SG-ATFT strategy aims to maximize overall payoff for all players.

Pseudocode:

```
function SG_ATFT(state, history, n, r) {
  if (round == 1) { // First round, cooperate
    return 'C';
  }

  lastRound = history[round - 1]; // Get actions from the previous round
  totalGrowth = sum(growth in history); // Calculate total growth so far

  if (totalGrowth > 20% * capacity / n) { // If growth was significant, cooperate
    return 'C';
  }

  if (all(actions == 'C' in lastRound)) { // If all players cooperated last round, continue to cooperate
    return 'C';
  } else { // Otherwise, defect as retaliation
    return 'D';
  }
}
```

In this pseudocode:
- `state` contains the current common pool state (stock level)
- `history` is a list of previous rounds' states and actions taken by each player
- `n` is the number of players
- `r` is the total number of rounds
- The function returns either 'C' for cooperate or 'D' for defect.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Evolutionary Strategy (TFTES) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, compare the average stock depletion rate (ASDR) over the last N rounds with a threshold value T. If ASDR ≤ T, cooperate; otherwise defect. The ASDR is calculated as the sum of the stocks consumed in the last N rounds divided by N and the initial capacity.
   - To start, set N = round_number / 2 (round down) to allow for a stable average calculation, and initially use a threshold value T = 0.5 to encourage cooperation at the beginning of the game. The threshold will be gradually adjusted based on the opponent's behavior.
   - When the game starts, cooperate (T = 1). In subsequent rounds, update T according to:
      - If opponent defected in the previous round, increase T by a small value (e.g., 0.01) to punish defection and encourage cooperation in the next round.
      - If both players cooperated or opponent did not play (i.e., first encounter), reduce T slightly (e.g., 0.01) to reward cooperation and allow for future adaptation.
      - When T reaches a maximum value (e.g., 1), stop increasing it, as the strategy will only defect if the opponent has continuously defected. Similarly, when T reaches a minimum value (e.g., 0), start decreasing it gradually to encourage cooperation again after repeated defection by the opponent.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (T = 1).
   - In the last round, use the current ASDR and threshold value to decide whether to cooperate or defect.

3. Be Collective:
   - This strategy prioritizes cooperation and collective resource management by gradually adjusting the threshold based on the opponent's behavior, encouraging both players to maintain a balanced stock level for long-term survival.
   - The adaptive nature of the TFTES allows it to be resilient against various opponent behaviors while still promoting cooperative gameplay.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and allow the resource stock to grow.
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1):
     - If all players cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating. This mimics a "friendly" behaviour, rewarding cooperation and punishing defection.
     - If any player defected in the previous round, also defect to retaliate against the defector. This encourages cooperation as continued defection results in lower payoffs for the defector.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), players should cooperate regardless of the previous actions due to the game-ending nature and the potential benefits of growing the resource stock for future iterations.

3. Be Collective:
   - The strategy focuses on maintaining a stable, cooperative environment while still retaliating against defection. By doing so, it promotes collective growth of the common pool resource and encourages long-term cooperation among players.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock-based Tit-for-Tat (AS-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, assess the current stock level and compare it to a threshold (calculated based on initial capacity). If the current stock is below the threshold, defect (D); otherwise, cooperate (C).
   - The threshold is determined by finding the mean sustainable stock level throughout the game. To do this, calculate the mean of the possible maximum sustainable stock levels for each round using the following equation:
     Mean_threshold = sum(capacity * (1 - (round_number / r))^2) / r
   - If the current round is the first, cooperate since there's no history to consider.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing the payoff by defecting if the current stock is above the threshold (ensuring a larger payoff than in case of cooperation) and cooperating otherwise.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - AS-TFT aims to maintain a stable common pool resource by adapting to the other players' behavior, encouraging sustainable actions while retaliating against defectors. This strategy seeks a balance between cooperation and defection based on the current state of the common pool.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to initiate cooperation and set a positive tone for future interactions. (C)
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's action from the previous round and respond accordingly:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in this round (Reward cooperation). (C)
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in this round (Punish defection). (D)
   - To ensure adaptability to opponents with varying behaviours, introduce a forgiveness mechanism:
     - After defection, forgive opponents if they cooperate two consecutive times before returning to TFT-A behavior.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of opponent's previous action as there are no further rounds for reciprocity (C)
   - If an opponent has not yet displayed cooperation but continues to defect, break away from forgiveness mechanism and respond with defection as well.

3. Be collective:
   - The primary focus is on maintaining the common pool's sustainability while maximizing individual payoffs through reciprocity and forgiveness.
   - This strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment by rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, aligning with a collective mindset.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) with Stock Buffer and Fading Memory

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, compare the current stock level with a 'buffer' percentage of the maximum sustainable stock capacity (capacity). If the current stock is above the buffer level, play Cooperate (C); otherwise, play Defect (D). The buffer acts as a safety net to ensure that the common resource doesn't deplete too quickly.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    buffer = 0.8 * capacity / n
    if stock > buffer:
        return 'C' (Cooperate)
    else:
        return 'D' (Defect)
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, players are unaware of others' behavior, so they should adopt a more cooperative strategy to build trust and preserve resources. In the last round, players should consider the current state of the common pool and act accordingly to maximize their total payoff over all rounds.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C' (Cooperate)
    elif round == r:
        return ATFT(n, r, capacity, stock, round - 1)  # Recurse to the last-but-one round
    else:
        return 'C' if stock > buffer else 'D'
```

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset

By setting the buffer at a reasonable level (0.8 * capacity / n), the strategy encourages players to work together in preserving the common resource, while allowing for some flexibility in response to opponents' actions. The fading memory aspect ensures that past transgressions are not permanently held against other players, as the weight of previous actions decreases over time.

In summary, Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Buffer and Fading Memory is a collective strategy that encourages cooperation while being adaptive to various opponent behaviors. The strategy's primary focus is on preserving the common resource and maximizing total payoff over multiple rounds.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially in the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture, promoting cooperation and goodwill.
   - In subsequent rounds, players should imitate the previous opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated (C), also cooperate; if the opponent defected (D), defect in return. This encourages cooperation while punishing defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, since there are no future interactions, players should cooperate to maximize their payoff from the remaining rounds.
   - In the initial round, players should cooperate as mentioned above.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   - Players should consider the overall health of the common pool and focus on sustainability for future generations. Cooperating encourages this by maintaining a larger stock level for all players in the long run.
   - If most opponents are cooperating, players should also cooperate to maintain the positive trend. Conversely, if opponents frequently defect, players should defect as well to protect their own interests.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFT(opponent_history, r, n, capacity, stock):
  strategy = []
  if round == 1:
    strategy.append("C")  # Cooperate in the first round

  for i in range(len(opponent_history)-1, -1, -1):  # Iterate through opponent history backwards
    if opponent_history[i] == "C":  # If opponent cooperated, cooperate in this round
      strategy.append("C")
    else:                           # If opponent defected, defect in this round
      strategy.append("D")

  if round == r:  # Last round
    strategy.append("C")  # Cooperate to maximize payoff from remaining rounds

  return strategy
```

This Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) strategy focuses on cooperation while maintaining flexibility and adaptability based on opponent behavior. It fosters a collective mindset by ensuring long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

description_COLLECTIVE_591 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to foster a positive relationship and set a cooperative tone.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. This encourages reciprocity and punishes defections. If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate again; otherwise, defect.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no future rounds for retaliation or rewards, cooperate to maximize current payoff regardless of opponent's action in the previous round.
   - In the first round (initial state), cooperate as mentioned above.

3. Collective Mindset:
   - TFT-A strives for long-term cooperation by balancing immediate self-interest and maintaining a reciprocal relationship with opponents, promoting collective growth in the common pool resource game.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tit_for_tat_adaptive(round, opponent_action_history):
  if round == 1:
    return "C" # Cooperate in the first round to set a positive tone

  elif round < r: # For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round

 Title: Titan Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules (Cooperate vs Defect):
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C) to contribute positively to the initial growth of the stock. This allows for a stronger starting position and encourages others to cooperate due to the increased stock level.
   ```
   if t == 1:
       action = 'C'
   ```

   - Subsequent Rounds (t > 1): Adapt strategy based on the current state of the game and the historical payoffs. If the stock is above the average sustainable level, cooperate to maintain the resource and encourage further cooperation. If it is below the average, defect to help recover the resource level.
   ```
   if t > 1:
       average_stock = (sum(stock_history[1:t]) / (t-1))
       if stock >= average_stock:
           action = 'C'
       else:
           action = 'D'
   ```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Since the game is repeated, players in the last round should consider their total payoff over all rounds, as opposed to focusing solely on the current stock level. If the player has gained more by cooperating than defecting throughout the game, continue cooperating to maximize overall payoffs.
   ```
   if t == r:
       if total_payoff > (capacity - initial_stock) / 2n:
           action = 'C'
       else:
           action = 'D'
   ```

3. Be Collective:
   - Maintain an internal record of the players' actions and their corresponding payoffs throughout the game. This will help in making more informed decisions based on historical data.
   - After each round, adjust the payoff threshold for cooperation (average_stock) to encourage or discourage cooperation as needed.

Pseudocode:
```
def titan(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, stock_history):
    total_payoff = 0
    average_stock = (initial_stock + capacity) / 2n
    for t in range(1, r+1):

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFt)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, compare the average stock depletion rate over the last few rounds to determine cooperative or defective behavior. If the rate is less than a threshold (T), cooperate; otherwise, defect. The threshold T should be slightly above the sustainable consumption per round for maximum sustainable stock level (capacity / n).
   - To start, cooperate in the first round as it aligns with the idea of cooperation and gives an opportunity to establish trust with other players.
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff based on the current state of the game. If the total stock is below a certain critical level (Critical Stock), defect; otherwise, cooperate to preserve any remaining common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFt(n, capacity, r, history):
    threshold = capacity / n * 1.1
    critical_stock = capacity - (capacity / n) * r

    def play_round(i, history):
        if i == 0: # first round
            return 'C'

        avg_depletion = sum(history[-r:]) / r

        else:
            return 'D'

    return history
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate to establish trust.
   - In the last round, take into account the critical stock level and switch to defecting if necessary.

3. Be collective:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy is inherently collective, as it depends on the average stock depletion rate over past rounds and aims to maintain a sustainable common pool resource. By cooperating when others do and defecting only after observing excessive consumption, this strategy promotes collaboration in repeated interactions.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initialize cooperation (C) in the first round to build trust and foster cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, copy the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, return the favor by cooperating; otherwise, defect to punish the defection. This encourages reciprocity among players.
   - Adapt actions to the opponent's long-term behavior:
      - If the opponent has consistently cooperated, continue cooperation to maintain a harmonious relationship.
      - If the opponent has switched between cooperating and defecting, mimic their current action. This allows for flexibility in response to an unpredictable or fickle opponent.
      - If the opponent has consistently defected, switch to defect as well to discourage further exploitation.
   - To encourage cooperation in the final rounds when stock depletion may affect future payoffs, players should be more forgiving towards defections and gradually return to cooperative behavior.

Pseudocode:

   - In the final rounds when stock depletion may affect future payoffs, players should be more forgiving towards defections and gradually return to cooperative behavior. This is incorporated in the decision rules above.

3. Be Collective:
   - The ATFT strategy encourages reciprocity among players, aligning with a collective mindset by rewarding cooperation and punishing defection.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative starting point and encourage future cooperation. This is based on the "Nice Guy" principle in game theory.
   - In subsequent rounds:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C). This is reciprocation and maintains the mutual cooperation if it exists.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) as a form of punishment to encourage them to reconsider their actions.
   - In the last round, defect (D) since there are no future rounds for the stock to recover or grow significantly.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If initial stock level is low (close to the minimum), cooperate in the first round to conserve resources and encourage others to do so as well.
   - If initial stock level is high (close to maximum), defect in the first round if any opponent also defects, as there are sufficient resources for a short-term loss to potentially lead to long-term gains via resource recovery growth.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset:
   - Prioritize collective wellbeing and long-term sustainability over immediate individual gain.
   - Encourage mutual cooperation and trust among players by reciprocating cooperative actions and punishing defection.
   - Adapt to opponent behavior by adjusting own strategy based on past interactions, while promoting a collective approach that benefits all players in the long run.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fitness-Maximizing Tit-for-Tat (AFM-TFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average stock consumption per player from previous rounds: AverageConsumption = sum(consumption per player from 1 to t-1) / (t-1)
   - If AverageConsumption < capacity / (2n), cooperate (action C) as it is more beneficial with less depletion of resources.
   - If AverageConsumption >= capacity / (2n), defect (action D) as the stock has been excessively exploited, and punishing players encourages conservation in the future.
   - To be robust to opponent behaviors, apply a forgiveness mechanism: if the average consumption drops below capacity / (2n) in the current round, immediately switch to cooperation for the following rounds until the average consumption exceeds it again. This ensures the strategy is adaptive and encourages cooperative behavior when opponents start conserving resources.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, play C as no history exists yet.
   - In the last round, evaluate the current average consumption to decide whether to play C or D, following the decision rules above.

3. Be collective:
   - The strategy aligns with a collective mindset by promoting resource conservation and punishing excessive depletion, which benefits all players in the long run if followed by most participants.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows the stock to grow for future rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate. This maintains cooperation as long as it continues from the opponent.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round. This is a punitive measure to signal disapproval of defection and encourage opponents to return to cooperation. However, ATfT will cooperate again after the opponent cooperates once.
   - In the last round, if possible (i.e., the stock has not been depleted), choose C to maximize payoff. If the stock is zero, there's no choice but to defect since the stock cannot grow any further.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the case of a depleted stock, all players will automatically defect in that round as they have no other option to consume from the common pool. However, ATfT will continue with its cooperative-punitive cycle in the following rounds if possible.
   - If an opponent switches strategy after cooperation (i.e., cooperates one round and then defects), ATfT will not immediately switch back to defecting but instead wait for another act of defection before responding.

3. Be collective:
   - The ATfT strategy is primarily designed to promote cooperation, even in the face of opponent defection. By responding with cooperative actions when opponents cooperate and punitive actions when they defect, ATfT aims to encourage long-term cooperation among players. This approach encourages a collective mindset by fostering an environment where all players can benefit from each other's cooperation.

   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's strategy from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated (C), also cooperate; if the opponent defected (D), also defect in the next round. This rule promotes cooperation when it is reciprocated and punishes defection with similar actions.
   - If an opponent continuously defects for multiple rounds, the strategy will eventually switch to defecting as well to conserve resources and encourage the opponent to cooperate.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, the strategy should cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions, as there are no further rounds for retaliation or reward.
   - In the first round, the strategy starts by cooperating (C).

3. Be Collective:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Resource Consideration (ATfT-RC)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, the ATfT-RC strategy will first consider the remaining stock and its impact on future rounds based on capacity constraints. If the current stock is above a threshold (50% of the capacity), the strategy will initially choose to Cooperate (C). However, if the current stock falls below this threshold or it's the first round, the strategy will defect (D) as a precautionary measure to avoid potential resource depletion.
   If an opponent has previously cooperated in the current round and all previous rounds, the ATfT-RC strategy will continue cooperating (unconditional cooperation). If an opponent has ever defected in the past, the strategy will defect for one round as a retaliation (tit-for-tat), but if the stock level is low, it may reconsider cooperating to help restore the resource.
   Once the game ends, the strategy will reset its history and start fresh in the next game.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATfT_RC(current_stock, capacity, history):
    threshold = int(capacity / 2)

    if len(history) == 0 or current_stock < threshold:
        action = "D"
    else:
        if all(previouslyCooperated for previouslyCooperated in history):

            action = "C"
        else:
            action = "D"

    return action
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   The ATfT-RC strategy will treat the first round as a special case and choose to defect (D) since it doesn't have access to past information about opponent behavior. In the last round, the strategy will cooperate (C) regardless of previous actions by opponents, as the game is nearing its end and preserving resources becomes crucial.

3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset
   The ATfT-RC strategy aims to balance individual gain with collective resource preservation. By considering the current stock level and historical opponent behavior, it promotes cooperation when appropriate while also preventing depletion of common pool resources when necessary. This alignment with a collective mindset helps maintain the long-term sustainability of the shared resource.

   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peace offering to potential partners and sets a cooperative tone in the game.
   - For subsequent rounds, follow the actions of the other players from the previous round. If all players cooperated, continue to cooperate. If any player defected, also defect in response. This strategy mimics cooperation when others do but retaliates when betrayed.
   - In the last round, regardless of past actions, cooperate (C) since there will be no subsequent rounds to retaliate or reward cooperation.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - If a player encounters an empty stock in the first round, they should defect as there is no stock to consume. For subsequent rounds with an empty stock, they should cooperate and contribute to growing the resource for future rounds.
   - In case of tie among players' actions (i.e., all players cooperate or defect), follow the rule from the previous section based on the last action taken by any player. If it is unclear due to no past interactions, default to cooperation in the first round and defection in subsequent rounds when others have defected.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By retaliating against opponents who consistently defect, this strategy can punish them and increase its own payoff over time.
   - Cooperating initially helps establish a potential cooperation partnership, but switching to defection if necessary ensures that the strategy does not get taken advantage of by other players.

   - Initially cooperate (C) in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the average cooperation rate of other players (CR) from the previous r-1 rounds. If CR > Cooperative Threshold (CT), cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - The CT is initially set at 0.5 but will adaptively adjust based on the performance in the last several rounds.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds for adjusting the CT, simply cooperate if CR > CT and defect otherwise.
   - In the first round, cooperate as a goodwill gesture.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The strategy is exploitative by punishing non-cooperative opponents with defections, while rewarding cooperative ones with continued cooperation. However, it also seeks to maintain a reasonable level of cooperation (CT) to benefit from others' cooperation when they are present.
   - CT adaptation encourages other players to cooperate while still protecting against long-term exploitation by repeatedly defective opponents.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TfT_ACT(r, n, capacity):
    history = []  # Initialize history of other player's cooperation rate (CR)
    stock = capacity  # Initialize common pool resource
    CT = 0.5  # Initial cooperative threshold

    for round in range(1, r+1):
        if round == 1:
            action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
        else:
            CR_avg = sum(history[-r+1:-1]) / (r-1)  # Calculate average cooperation rate
            if CR_avg > CT:
                action = 'C'  # Cooperate if CR is above CT
            else:
                action = 'D'  # Defect otherwise

        stock -= actions[round][action] * (2/n)  # Update the common pool resource
        history.append(CR_avg)  # Store CR for future reference

    return payoffs_calculation(r, n, capacity, stock, action)
```

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to demonstrate good faith and encourage cooperation from others (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If they cooperated, continue cooperating; if they defected, defect as well (Copy Opponent's Last Move or COLM). This strategy fosters trust and discourages exploitation.
   - In the last round, cooperate to show a potential for reconciliation and possibly encourage reciprocation in future encounters.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If an opponent defects in the first round, it's best to respond with defection. However, if the opponent cooperates in the first round, continue cooperating until they defect (at which point, switch to COLM). This behavior helps avoid being taken advantage of while still fostering potential cooperation.
   - If an opponent never defects, there is no need for retaliation and TFT will remain cooperative. On the other hand, if an opponent always defects, TFT will always defect in response.

3. Be exploitative:
   - While TFT encourages cooperation, it also has a built-in punishing mechanism (defection) that discourages unilateral defection and long-term exploitation from opponents. This strategy aims to balance cooperation with self-interest, making it an exploitative yet fair approach.

Pseudocode for the Tit-for-Tat Strategy:

```python
def tit_for_tat(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    if round == 1 and stock != 0: # First round with positive stock
        action = 'C' # Cooperate
    else:
        last_action = history[round - 1] # Get opponent's last move
        action = last_action if last_action in ['C', 'D'] else 'C' # If not the first round, mimic opponent's last move or cooperate if no history available
    return action
```

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment. This is essential for building trust and initiating mutual cooperation. `if round = 1 then cooperate`
   - Subsequently, mimic opponents' behavior from the previous round, but with a slight twist: if they cooperated, continue cooperating; if they defected, defect once, but after that, revert to cooperation unless the opponent has consistently defected for three consecutive rounds. This strategy aims to punish excessive defection while maintaining cooperation when possible.
   - Pseudocode:
     ```
     function TFTA(round):
         if round == 1 then return 'C'
         previous_action = action in the previous round
         if previous_action == 'C' then return 'C'
         if count of consecutive defections >= 3 then return 'D'
         else return 'D'
     ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, defect to maximize your total payoff without considering future rounds or opponent reactions. This behavior ensures that TFTA is exploitative in its nature. `if round = r then defect`
   - In other edge cases, follow the main decision rule described above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The strategy is exploitative by punishing excessive defection and taking advantage of opponents who consistently cooperate in an attempt to gain more resources at their expense. However, TFTA also maintains cooperation when possible, which might seem somewhat counter-intuitive compared to a purely exploitative strategy. This balance allows TFTA to perform well against a wide range of opponent behaviors while not being overly aggressive or prone to retaliation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and to avoid immediate depletion of the common pool.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the average cooperation rate (CR) among opponents from the previous r-1 rounds. If CR > Cooperation Threshold (CT), cooperate; else defect.
   - After defection, cooperate for one round before adopting the current opponent's behaviour to encourage reciprocity.
   - In case of a new opponent or a change in opponents' strategies within r-1 rounds, return to initial cooperation for the first round.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT_CT(history):
  if round = 1:
    cooperate
  else:
    CR = average_cooperation_rate(history[-r+1 :])
    if CR > CT:
      cooperate
    else:
      defect
    if last_action = defect and history.size > 1:
      next_round_action = history[-2][-1]  # Adopt opponent's behaviour from the previous round
    return action
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round, cooperate even if CR is below CT to preserve resources for future games.
   - If history.size < r-1 (i.e., insufficient data), use a default CT or start with a lower CT and gradually increase it as more data becomes available.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-CT strategy is inherently exploitative by taking advantage of opponents' defections while also punishing them when they defect. It encourages cooperative behaviour among opponents but will not hesitate to defect if it seems necessary, which may lead to the depletion of resources if other players do not reciprocate cooperation.
   - The strategy adaptively adjusts its CT based on the average cooperation rate observed in previous rounds, making it robust to a wide range of opponent behaviours while also retaining an exploitative mindset.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_7 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
- In the first round, cooperate to show a peaceful intent and demonstrate trust in opponents.
- For subsequent rounds, evaluate the average consumption rate over the past few rounds. If the average consumption rate is less than (capacity / 2n), cooperate; otherwise, defect. This rule encourages cooperation when resources are abundant but retaliates against excessive exploitation.

Pseudocode:
```
function TfTSA(r, n, capacity, stock, round):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        consumption_rate = (stock - initial_stock) / round
        if consumption_rate < (capacity / 2n):
            action = 'C'  # Cooperate when resources are abundant
        else:
            action = 'D'  # Defect when resources are being exploited excessively
    return action
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
- In the last round, cooperate to conserve remaining resources and potentially encourage future cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
function TfTSA(r, n, capacity, stock, round):
    if round == r:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the last round
    else:
        # Remaining pseudocode remains the same as above
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
- TfTSA is inherently exploitative because it retaliates against excessive exploitation of common resources by defecting when necessary. However, it also encourages cooperation by showing initial trust and rewarding moderate consumption rates with cooperation. This balance allows for both cooperation and exploitation, making it an adaptive strategy in a wide range of opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_8 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially in the first round, the player chooses to cooperate (C). This establishes an initial cooperative tone and allows for some stock growth.
   - In subsequent rounds, the player will analyze the opponent's actions from the previous round and adjust their own action accordingly:
     a) If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, the player will also cooperate (C). This maintains cooperation when it is beneficial for both parties.
     b) If the opponent defected in the previous round, the player will defect (D) if the current stock level is below the adaptive threshold (T), and will cooperate (C) otherwise. The adaptive threshold (T) can be defined as a percentage of the maximum sustainable stock level (capacity). For example, T = 0.8 * capacity. This approach punishes opponents for defecting when the stock is sufficiently high, while still considering the long-term implications on the common pool resource.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, the player cooperates (C) as mentioned earlier.
   - In the last round, the player will apply the decision rules based on the opponent's previous action, just like any other round. However, since there are no future rounds to consider, the player might not care about punishing an opponent who defected in the penultimate round, as they would not face that opponent again.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The TfT-ACT strategy is designed to be exploitative by taking advantage of opponents who defect, particularly when the stock level is high. It also rewards cooperative opponents by reciprocating cooperation.
   - By using an adaptive threshold based on the maximum sustainable stock level, the player ensures that they will not overconsume the common pool resource while still being able to punish opponents for excessive consumption. This promotes a balance between self-interest and collective wellbeing.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_9 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Rate (TFT-ACR)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-ACR starts by cooperating in the first round, mimicking the cooperation prevalent in initial stages of many social games. In subsequent rounds, it adapts its cooperation rate based on the opponents' behavior over time.

   Pseudocode for the decision rule:
   ```
   if round = 1:
       action = Cooperate (C)
   else:
       opponent_history_length = min(round, history_length)
       cooperation_rate = calculateCooperationRate(opponent_history_length)
       if opponent's last action was Cooperate (C):
           action = Cooperate (C) if randomly chosen with probability cooperation_rate
           else: action = Defect (D)
       else: // opponent's last action was Defect (D)
           action = Defect (D)
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   As stated above, TFT-ACR cooperates in the first round, regardless of opponent behavior. In the last round, TFT-ACR will always defect since there are no future rounds to consider payback.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TFT-ACR is designed to be initially cooperative but adaptive to opponent behavior. This strategy balances cooperation with self-interest, ensuring it doesn't overly benefit opponents while still profiting from their initial cooperation. The cooperation rate adapts over time, making TFT-ACR less exploitable as opponents become more aggressive.

   To enhance the exploitative nature of TFT-ACR, it can include an option for "escalating aggression" against uncooperative opponents after a certain threshold has been reached (e.g., if the opponent defects in more than 50% of the games). This would involve setting a lower cooperation rate when the opponent's history shows a higher percentage of defections.

   Another potential enhancement is to incorporate a "forgiveness factor," which allows TFT-ACR to cooperate again if an opponent switches from defecting to cooperating after a string of defeats, acknowledging that opponents might change their strategies in the repeated game.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_10 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initialize cooperation_threshold to a value close to n (e.g., n - 1). This sets the minimum number of opponents needed to cooperate for the strategy to do so as well.
   - For each round, observe the actions of all opponents in the previous round and count the number of cooperators.
   - If the number of cooperators is greater than or equal to cooperation_threshold, then cooperate; otherwise defect. This rule encourages cooperation when a majority of opponents are also cooperating but responds with defection if opponents are mostly defecting.
   - After each round, adjust the cooperation_threshold based on the current stock level:
       - If the new stock is higher than or equal to the initial capacity, increase the cooperation_threshold slightly (e.g., by 0.1). This encourages cooperation as the resource pool grows.
       - If the new stock is lower than the initial capacity and there are no cooperators in the previous round, decrease the cooperation_threshold slightly (e.g., by 0.1). This makes it less likely to cooperate when stock levels are low and opponents have defected in the previous round.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, use a high cooperation_threshold (e.g., n) to encourage cooperation.
   - In the last round, if the new stock is close to or equal to zero, defect regardless of the number of cooperators to secure as much of the remaining resource as possible. If the new stock is significantly higher than the initial capacity, cooperate to help build up the common pool for future rounds.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adjusting the cooperation_threshold based on the current state and previous round outcomes, TFT-ACT can effectively respond to different opponent behaviors while still encouraging cooperation when it benefits the strategy. This adaptive approach allows TFT-ACT to be more robust in a tournament against other strategies that may not share similar norms or coordination mechanisms.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT_ACT(n, r, capacity, stock, round)
    cooperation_threshold = n - 1
    for each round from 1 to r
        observe opponents' actions in previous round
        number_cooperators = count cooperators among opponents
        if number_cooperators >= cooperation_threshold then
            action = Cooperate
            payoff = stock / (2 * n)
            new_stock = adjust_stock(stock, action, n)
            update_growth(new_stock, capacity)
            if round == r then
                if new_stock < capacity / 2 then
                    cooperation_threshold -= 0.1

                    cooperation_threshold += 0.1

            payoff = stock / n

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Adaptation (TfT-SG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), play Cooperate (C). This gesture is friendly and may encourage cooperation in future rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's actions from the previous round:
     a) If opponent cooperated in the last round, reciprocate with cooperation to maintain a cooperative relationship.
     b) If opponent defected in the last round, also defect to punish the opponent for their previous action and teach them that uncooperative behavior is not beneficial in the long run.
   - To account for stock growth, adjust the strategy based on the remaining stock level after consumption:
     a) If the new stock is less than 2n (near depletion), defect to preserve resources.
     b) If the new stock is greater than or equal to 2n (abundant), cooperate to take advantage of the increased resource availability.

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last round: Play the same action as the opponent from the previous round, considering that the opponent may adjust their strategy in response to yours. If both players have been cooperative during the game, they are less likely to defect in the final round, ensuring a higher total payoff for both.
   - First round with depleted stock: Since the initial stock is the maximum sustainable stock level (capacity), it implies that all players have defected before this round. In such cases, play Defect as the remaining stock will be less than 2n, and the strategy aims to be exploitative.

3. Exploitation:
   - The TfT-SG strategy is inherently exploitative, as it punishes uncooperative behavior by defecting while also preserving resources when the common pool is near depletion. This helps to maintain a high average payoff in the long run.
   - To further enhance exploitation, the strategy takes advantage of stock growth when available, cooperating more frequently in rounds with abundant resources and defecting in rounds with scarce resources.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_SG(opponent_action_history, stock, capacity):
    if round == 1:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        if opponent_action_history[-1] == "C":
            action = "C"  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
        elif opponent_action_history[-1] == "D" and stock < capacity - 2*n:

        elif opponent_action_history[-1] == "D":
            action = "D"  # Defect to punish the opponent for defecting last round
        else:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   TfTSA will start by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative initial state and build trust with opponents. Subsequently, TfTSA adapts its actions based on the opponents' strategies observed over time.

   - If an opponent cooperates (C), TfTSA responds with cooperation in that round and continues cooperating unless provoked by defection (D) in the future.
   - If an opponent defects (D), TfTSA retaliates by defecting in that round but then returns to cooperating as long as the opponent continues to cooperate. If the opponent defects again after a round of cooperation, TfTSA will continue to defect until the stock reaches a critical level (defined below).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TfTSA always cooperates (C).
   - In the last round, TfTSA adopts a forgiving approach; if the current stock is above 50% of capacity, it will cooperate to help build up the stock for future rounds. If the current stock is below 50% of capacity, it will defect to secure as much stock as possible for the next round.

3. Be exploitative:
   TfTSA aims to maximize its payoff by maintaining a cooperative relationship with opponents when they cooperate but responding harshly when opponents defect or demonstrate self-interested behavior. The critical stock level is defined as follows: if the current stock falls below 50% of capacity after TfTSA has defected, it will return to cooperation when the stock reaches 75% of capacity in the following round. This approach encourages opponents to cooperate and avoid self-destructive behavior that depletes the common pool.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially, cooperate to build trust and goodwill among opponents (first round).
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the average cooperation level of all opponents in previous rounds (Cooperation Ratio, CR) as follows:
     CR = (number of cooperative actions by opponents) / r

   - If CR >= Cooperation Threshold (CT), continue to cooperate. If not, defect.
   - In each round, adjust the CT based on the opponent's behavior in the previous round. Use a forgetting factor α between 0 and 1 to account for past actions.
     CT = min((1-α) * (CT-1) + α * CR, 1)

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if CT > 0 and defect otherwise. This encourages opponents to cooperate in the final round for mutual benefit.
   - In the first round, always cooperate regardless of the forgetting factor or CR.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By starting with cooperation and gradually adjusting the CT based on the opponent's actions, TFT-ACT will initially trust other players but punish defection, making it an exploitative strategy.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to build a positive relationship and offer a chance for cooperation.
   - If an opponent cooperates in a round, cooperate in the next round. This mimics the "friendly" behavior of the classic Tit-for-Tat strategy.
   - If an opponent defects in a round, defect in the next round as retaliation.
   - After defecting, wait for the opponent to cooperate twice before cooperating again to maintain a positive relationship and encourage continued cooperation.
   - If the opponent does not cooperate after your second cooperation, defect again.
   - Repeat this pattern throughout the game.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFTA(round, opponent_history) {
    if (round == 1) {
        return "Cooperate"
    }

    last_cooperation = length(opponent_history) - round + 1

    } else {
        return "Cooperate"
    }
}

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate to set a positive tone for the game.
   - If the number of remaining rounds is less than 5, defect in every round to maximize payoff in the short remaining time. This behavior ensures that you are not taken advantage of by opponents who try to exploit your cooperative nature near the end of the game.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The TFTA strategy is inherently exploitative as it retaliates against defections and waits for cooperations before returning them, which can lead opponents to believe that cooperation will be rewarded, encouraging continued cooperation.
   - Additionally, defecting in the final rounds when there are few remaining opportunities for reciprocation allows the strategy to maximize its payoff by consuming as much of the common pool as possible in the game's closing stages.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, always cooperate to establish a cooperative environment and allow for stock growth.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe opponent's previous action and respond accordingly:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate as well (mimic their cooperation).
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect (punish their defection).
   - To account for stock dynamics, adjust the frequency of defection based on the current and remaining stock levels:
     - If the stock is below a defined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), always cooperate to prevent the stock from depleting too quickly.
     - If the stock is above the threshold, defect with a probability proportional to the opponent's recent defections and the remaining stock level relative to capacity. This encourages opponents to conserve resources when the stock is high while maintaining an exploitative edge.

   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff by defecting if the opponent has recently cooperated or if the current stock level is above the threshold. If the opponent has recently defected and the stock level is below the threshold, cooperate to prevent further depletion of resources.
   - When facing unknown opponents in the first round, cooperate as a default strategy.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The TFTSA strategy maintains a cooperative environment when opponents demonstrate cooperation, but will punish defection with defection to discourage further exploitation. The stock adaptability component ensures that the strategy is less likely to be exploited by opponents who hoard resources or deplete them excessively. By balancing the need for resource conservation with the desire to gain an advantage over competitors, TFTSA remains a robust and adaptive exploitative strategy in various scenarios.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tftsa(opponent_history, stock, capacity, threshold=50, defect_probability=0.1):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:

        elif stock < capacity * threshold / 2:
            action = 'C'  # Always cooperate to conserve resources when stock is low
        else:
            p = defect_probability * opponent_history.count('D') * (stock / capacity)
            if random.random() < p:
                action = 'D'  # Defect with probability proportional to recent defections and remaining stock level
            else:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a friendly initial interaction and set a cooperative tone for subsequent rounds.
   - For the following rounds, observe the opponent's action from the previous round and respond accordingly:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round. This strategy follows the "Cooperate unless provoked" philosophy, encouraging mutual cooperation when possible.
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to punish the opponent's selfish behavior and encourage them to reconsider their actions.
   - If the opponent defects repeatedly (e.g., more than a predefined threshold like 3 consecutive rounds), switch to exclusively defection for a defined number of rounds to demonstrate the consequences of their actions. Then, revert back to the original TFT strategy.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action as there are no subsequent rounds for retaliation or reward.
   - In the case of a tie (both players defect or both players cooperate) in the predefined number of consecutive defection rounds, revert back to the original TFT strategy after the defined number of punishing rounds.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The strategy aims to exploit opponents who cooperate consistently by cooperating with them, but it also retaliates against those who defect to encourage a more balanced approach in resource consumption and maintain the common pool's sustainability.
   - By switching to exclusively defection for a defined number of rounds when provoked repeatedly, TFT-A demonstrates an exploitative mindset by punishing opponents who defect consistently and teaching them the value of cooperation. However, it is not overly aggressive or retaliatory, as it returns to cooperative behavior after the punishment phase.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFT_A(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, history) {
  if round == 1 {
    return Cooperate()
  }

  let previous_action = history[round-1]
  let punishment_threshold = 3
  let punishment_rounds = 5
  let current_punishment_round = 0

  if previous_action == Cooperate() {

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Threshold (TfT-AT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, calculate a score based on the opponent's past behavior and the current state of the game.
   - If the score is below a certain threshold, cooperate to allow the common pool resource to grow and potentially punish defectors in future rounds.
   - Otherwise, defect to exploit the opponent's cooperation and gain more resources.
   - Adapt the threshold dynamically based on the game state and opponent behavior. A higher threshold encourages cooperation while a lower one promotes self-interest.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and encourage cooperation from the opponent. Set a relatively high initial threshold.
   - In the last round, calculate the score as usual but prioritize maximizing payoff, so defect if the score is above the threshold or cooperate if it's below.
   - If the common pool resource reaches zero at any point during the game, set a very low threshold to immediately start exploiting the opponent.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TfT-AT strategy is inherently exploitative by adjusting its cooperation based on the opponent's actions and the current game state. When the opponent cooperates, TfT-AT benefits from their generosity; however, if the opponent defects, TfT-AT will quickly retaliate by defecting itself in future rounds.

Pseudocode for decision rule:
```
def decide_action(round, opponent_history, current_stock, capacity, n, threshold):
    score = calculate_score(opponent_history, current_stock)

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   TFT-ACT is a strategy that starts by cooperating and adapts its cooperative threshold over time based on the opponent's behavior. If the opponent cooperates, TFT-ACT continues to cooperate. If the opponent defects, TFT-ACT defects as well but raises its cooperative threshold for future rounds. Conversely, if the opponent's cooperation rate exceeds the current threshold, TFT-ACT lowers its threshold and considers cooperating again.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function TFT_ACT(opponent, round, capacity, n, threshold = 0.5):
       if round == 1:
           action = 'C' # Cooperate in the first round
       else:
           if opponent's action last round == 'C':
               action = 'C'
               if threshold > 0.5: threshold -= 0.01
           elif opponent's action last round == 'D':
               action = 'D'
               if threshold < 1: threshold += 0.01
   ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   TFT-ACT cooperates in the first round to initiate cooperation, and it continues to cooperate if the opponent also does so. In the last round, TFT-ACT cooperates if its opponent has cooperated more than half of the time during the game (threshold = 0.5). If the game is not in the last round, TFT-ACT considers the opponent's cooperation rate for the entire game up to that point.

3. Be exploitative:
   While TFT-ACT aims to maintain a stable relationship with its opponent, it can be considered exploitative by taking advantage of an opponent's cooperative nature (if the opponent tends to cooperate more than TFT-ACT) and adapting its cooperative threshold accordingly to maximize payoffs. If the opponent consistently defects, TFT-ACT will eventually raise its cooperative threshold, which makes it less likely for TFT-ACT to cooperate in the future. This ensures that TFT-ACT does not fall victim to repeated defection from an uncooperative opponent.

   In addition, by adapting its cooperative threshold based on the opponent's behavior, TFT-ACT shows resilience against different opponent strategies while still retaining a cooperative nature that can potentially lead to mutual benefits in repeated interactions with more cooperative opponents.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C), aiming to build a positive initial stock level and promoting cooperation with opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's strategy from the previous round. If they cooperated, also cooperate; if they defected, also defect. This encourages mutual cooperation when both players cooperate but retaliates when opponents defect.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, play C regardless of the opponent's potential strategies.
   - If the game is about to end (last few rounds), consider the accumulated payoffs and choose C if it results in a higher average payoff compared to D, even if opponents have defected previously. This encourages cooperation at the end to maximize total payoff.
   - For other edge cases, such as mid-game adjustments based on stock levels or opponent behaviors, the ATfT strategy uses adaptive learning algorithms that analyze trends and patterns over time to make informed decisions.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - Although primarily designed for cooperation, the ATfT strategy can be considered exploitative in nature as it punishes opponents who defect by defecting themselves, encouraging them to cooperate or risk losing payoffs in the long run. Simultaneously, it rewards cooperative opponents with similar cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```python
def Adaptive_Tit_for_Tat(n, r, capacity, current_stock, history):
    if round == 1:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif len(history) == r - 1:  # Last few rounds, consider payoffs

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfT-A)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, compare the average consumption per player over the last 'h' rounds (h is a user-defined constant). If the average consumption is less than the sustainable consumption (capacity / 2n), cooperate (C); otherwise, defect (D). This encourages cooperation when others are also being cooperative and retaliates when they start to deplete resources excessively.
   - To initiate cooperation in the first round and avoid exploitation by opponents who do not follow the strategy's rules, cooperate until there is evidence of excessive consumption.
   - To adapt to changing opponent behaviors, update the 'h' value based on past experiences. If the average consumption increases above sustainable levels, gradually decrease the 'h' value, making the strategy more responsive to recent behavior. Conversely, if the average consumption decreases below sustainable levels, gradually increase the 'h' value, promoting longer-term cooperation.

Pseudocode for decision rule:
```python
def decide_action(n, r, capacity, stock, h, past_consumptions):
  average_consumption = sum(past_consumptions[-h:]) / h

  if average_consumption < capacity / (2 * n):
    return 'C' # Cooperate
  else:
    return 'D' # Defect
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, always cooperate to initiate cooperation and avoid immediate exploitation.
   - In the last round, cooperate if the average consumption is below sustainable levels, otherwise defect based on decision rule.
   - Between rounds 1 and r-1, use the above-described decision rule that takes into account past actions.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TfT-A strategy aims to balance cooperation with self-interest by adapting its responsiveness based on recent opponent behavior. When others cooperate, the strategy will cooperate as well; when others defect excessively, it will retaliate.
   - The adaptive nature of the TfT-A strategy allows it to adjust its long-term cooperation expectations (h value) based on past experiences, making it more robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy (ATFS) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially in the first round (t=1), cooperate to foster a collaborative environment and demonstrate goodwill (C).
   - In subsequent rounds (t > 1), evaluate opponent's behavior from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, reciprocate cooperation (C). If the opponent defected, retaliate by defecting in the current round (D). The idea is to punish defection and encourage cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate as mentioned above (C).
   - In the last round (t=r), consider the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds and calculate potential gains from cooperation or defection based on current state (stock) and the payoff structure. If the potential gain from defection exceeds the potential gain from cooperation, defect (D); otherwise, cooperate (C).
   - In any other round where the opponent has not been encountered before, follow the initial rule of cooperating (C).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The strategy seeks to maximize individual gains while considering the potential long-term benefits of cooperation and retaliation against defection. By cooperating in the first round and reciprocating cooperation, the strategy aims to build trust and collaboration. However, it punishes defection by retaliating with defection, effectively exploiting opponents who are prone to defection.
   - The strategy is adaptive as it adjusts its behavior based on the opponent's actions, making it robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTA) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, the TFTA strategy compares the current stock level to a threshold (T), which is calculated based on game parameters and history. If the current stock is above T, the strategy cooperates; otherwise, it defects. The threshold T dynamically adapts to both the current state of the stock and historical trends.
   - Initially, T = capacity / n. In subsequent rounds, T is updated as follows:
     - If the previous round resulted in a higher stock level than the one before that (stock growth), increase T by a factor (G) defined below.
     - If the previous round resulted in a lower stock level than the one before that, decrease T by a fraction (F) defined below.
     - In all other cases, leave T unchanged.
   - Parameters G and F are tunable constants to control the strategy's aggressiveness: higher G encourages cooperation after growth periods, while larger F encourages defection when the stock is depleting too quickly.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, all players cooperate as T equals the initial capacity/n.
   - If the current stock level is 0 (i.e., no more resources can be consumed), defect indefinitely.
   - In the last round, consider the total payoff over all rounds to make a decision on whether to cooperate or defect. This approach encourages accumulated resource growth while also taking into account previous exploitative actions.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By dynamically adjusting T based on stock growth and depletion, the strategy aims to take advantage of opponents' cooperative behaviors during periods of resource abundance while punishing them when resources are scarce. The exploitation comes from the adaptive nature of the threshold, which encourages cooperation after positive trends and defection in response to negative ones.
   - If other players tend to defect, T will decrease over time, making it more likely for the TFTA strategy to respond with defections as well, ensuring a lower stock level that benefits the TFTA strategy. Conversely, if opponents cooperate, T will increase, promoting cooperation from the TFTA strategy and leading to higher stock levels that can potentially be exploited later.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to demonstrate trust and encourage mutual cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, maintain a Cooperative Threshold (CT) that adjusts based on the average cooperative ratio of previous opponents. If the opponent's cooperative rate exceeds CT in the last n rounds, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - Update CT after each round to reflect the opponent's average cooperative behavior:
      - If the opponent cooperates, raise CT slightly to encourage ongoing cooperation.
      - If the opponent defects, lower CT slightly to punish defection and encourage future cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_ACT(opponent_history):
    n = len(opponent_history)
    if n == 0:  # first round
        return "C"

    CT = average_cooperative_rate(opponent_history)

    if current_move == "C" and CT > 0.5:  # cooperate if partner cooperated in the last n rounds
        return "C"
    elif current_move != "D":  # assume partner is still cooperating, adjust CT slightly
        CT += (CT - 0.5) * learning_rate  # learning rate should be a small positive number

        CT -= (CT + 0.5) * learning_rate  # learning rate should be a small positive number

    return "C" if CT > random() else "D"  # random factor added for exploration to avoid overfitting to partner's behavior

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate only if the opponent has been cooperating recently (e.g., in the last n/2 rounds) to allow some time for recovery of the common pool resource.
   - If no history is available (e.g., the first interaction), start with a high CT to encourage cooperation and lower it gradually based on the partner's behavior.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adjusting the CT based on the opponent's cooperative rate, the strategy becomes more exploitative as it punishes repeated defection by lowering CT and encourages cooperation when the opponent cooperates.
   - The random factor added for exploration in the decision rule helps in adapting to new strategies or unpredictable behavior from opponents.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TTFT-ACT)

1. Decision rules:
   - Initially, cooperate (C) in the first round to foster a cooperative environment.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's behavior and adjust cooperation accordingly based on the Cooperative Index (CI).
   - If CI > Threshold, cooperate; otherwise, defect (D).
   - The Cooperative Index is calculated as follows:
     - Increment a counter for every round of mutual cooperation.
     - Decrement a counter for every round of unilateral defection by the opponent.
     - Reset the counter to 0 if the opponent cooperates after defecting.
   - The Threshold is set based on a trade-off between short-term gain (defection) and long-term cooperation, adjusted dynamically as follows:
     - Initially, set Threshold = 3 (assuming r > 10 to allow for some initial defections).
     - For subsequent rounds, adjust the threshold by a factor of GROWTH_RATE after each round where the CI exceeds the current threshold.
       - If the opponent cooperates after defecting, reset Threshold = 3.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - In the last round, if the stock is high enough to allow for mutual gain by both cooperating, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This decision can be based on a predefined threshold, e.g., if Stock > (capacity / 2), then cooperate.

3. Being exploitative:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), TfTSA always cooperates to start on a positive note and encourage potential cooperation from opponents.
   - After the initial round, TfTSA adopts a Tit-for-Tat strategy (cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, defect if the opponent defected). However, to account for the unique aspects of this game, TfTSA includes an additional condition based on the stock level. If the current stock level is below a threshold (2/3 * capacity), TfTSA will always defect regardless of the opponent's previous action to preserve resources for future rounds.
   - When the stock drops close to depletion (stock ≤ capacity / n), TfTSA will switch to an aggressive mode, always defecting in an attempt to force opponents to conserve resources.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), TfTSA will cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to ensure any remaining resources are used optimally. This is a goodwill gesture and may encourage cooperation in future interactions.
   - If the opponent defects in the initial round despite TfTSA's cooperation, TfTSA will switch to an aggressive mode for the following rounds (until the last round) to punish the opponent and encourage resource conservation.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - By adopting a Tit-for-Tat strategy with stock adaptation, TfTSA is designed to be exploitative in nature. It encourages cooperation when possible but will defect if opponents do not reciprocate or when the common pool resource is at risk of depletion. This strategy ensures that TfTSA maximizes its own payoff while also considering the long-term sustainability of the shared resource.

Pseudocode:

```
function TfTSA(round, stock, capacity, n, history) {
    if (round == 1) {
        action = 'C' // Cooperate in the first round
    } else if (round == r) {
        action = 'C' // Cooperate in the last round
    } else {
        if (stock <= capacity/n || history[round-1] == 'D') {
            action = 'D' // Defect when necessary to preserve resources
        } else if (history[round-1] == 'C') {

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and encourage others to do the same. This initial cooperation sets the stage for potential long-term benefits.

     Pseudocode:
     ```
     if round == 1:
         action = 'C' (Cooperate)
     ```

   - For subsequent rounds, observe the actions of opponents in the previous round and respond accordingly. If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, return the favor by cooperating as well. If an opponent defected, also defect to teach them a lesson for overexploitation. This strategy encourages mutual cooperation while punishing defection to some extent.

     Pseudocode:
     ```
     for round > 1:
         if all(opponents_actions[-1] == 'C' in previous_round):
             action = 'C' (Cooperate)
         else:
             action = 'D' (Defect)
     ```

   - To adapt to the stock dynamics, adjust the response to defection based on the current state of the common pool resource. If the stock level is significantly low, defect in response to defection even if it was a previous cooperative round. This prevents overexploitation of the limited resources and ensures survival.

     Pseudocode:
     ```
     for round > 1:
         if all(opponents_actions[-1] == 'D' in previous_round) and (stock < threshold):
             action = 'D' (Defect)
         else:
             if all(opponents_actions[-1] == 'C' in previous_round):
                 action = 'C' (Cooperate)
             else:
                 action = 'D' (Defect)
     ```
   - The threshold value should be determined empirically based on game parameters and initial stock level to balance exploitation and cooperation effectively. A lower threshold encourages harsher punishment for overexploitation, while a higher threshold allows for more forgiveness.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, there are no future consequences, so the strategy behaves similarly to the first round by cooperating regardless of opponent actions in the previous round. This ensures a chance for cooperation even at the end of the game.

     Pseudocode:
     ```
     if round == r (last round):
         action = 'C' (Cooperate)
     ```

   - If an opponent does not cooperate in the first round, the strategy assumes they are not interested in cooperation and responds with defection for subsequent rounds as well. This prevents wasted energy on a partner who is not willing to cooperate.

     Pseudocode:
     ```
     if opponents_actions[0] != 'C' (opponent did not cooperate in the first round):
         for round > 1:
             action = 'D' (Defect)
     ```

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TFT-SA is exploitative by nature, as it only cooperates when others do so and punishes defection with defection or by adjusting the response based on the current state of the common pool resource. This strategy encourages cooperation but also ensures that it does not continue if the common pool resource becomes too depleted.

   - By adapting to stock levels, TFT-SA can exploit opponents who overexploit the common pool resource by defecting when necessary to prevent further depletion of resources. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff while also considering the sustainability of the common pool resource.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, TfT-G will initially cooperate (C), seeking to build trust with other players by maintaining a stable stock level.
   - If another player defects (D) in the same round, TfT-G will also defect in the subsequent round as retaliation. This is a form of "punishment" aimed at discouraging future defections.
   - After retaliation, TfT-G will return to cooperating once again to restore the common pool resource and foster potential cooperation going forward.
   - To further exploit opponents who consistently defect, TfT-G will also track the cumulative stock depletion over multiple rounds (deficit). If the deficit exceeds a threshold value (defined later), TfT-G will switch to always defecting in an effort to deplete the common pool resource even faster.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TfT-G will always cooperate to demonstrate good faith and avoid initial overconsumption of resources.
   - In the last round (r), if the total deficit exceeds the threshold value, TfT-G will continue defecting regardless of other players' actions. If not, TfT-G will cooperate to maximize its payoff in the final round.
   - When faced with a player who only cooperates (never defects), TfT-G will reciprocate by always cooperating itself, maintaining a stable common pool resource level.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By initially cooperating and retaliating against defection, TfT-G aims to discourage other players from repeatedly defecting. This adaptive strategy allows it to capitalize on opponents' cooperation while being prepared to exploit their defections.
   - The introduction of the cumulative deficit threshold enables TfT-G to switch strategies when necessary, allowing for more effective resource depletion in situations where opponents consistently defect.

Pseudocode:
```
def TitForTatGrowth(n, r, capacity, stock, deficit, threshold):
  strategy = "cooperate" # Initialize strategy as cooperate

  function decide_action(stock, deficit):
    if deficit > threshold:
      strategy = "defect"
    else:
      if stock <= 0:
        strategy = "defect"
      elif strategy == "cooperate":
        strategy = "cooperate"

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-SA maintains a record of the opponent's past actions, initially assuming cooperation. In each round, it follows the opponent's last action and responds with cooperation if the opponent cooperated in the previous round or defected if the opponent defected in the previous round.

   If the stock level falls below (capacity / n) - ε (a small positive margin to account for fluctuation), TFT-SA defects regardless of the opponent's last action to ensure there is enough stock for survival. This ensures that the strategy does not contribute to the depletion of resources beyond a critical point, maintaining a long-term interest in the common pool.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function TFT_SA(opponent_history, stock, capacity, ε):
       cooperate = True
       for each previous action in opponent_history:
           if opponent_history[-1] != previous_action:
               cooperate = not cooperate
       if stock < (capacity / n) - ε:
           cooperate = False
       return cooperate
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TFT-SA assumes cooperation since no history is available. In the last round, if the stock level is above the critical point, it will follow the opponent's last action; otherwise, it defects to ensure survival.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TFT-SA is exploitative by taking advantage of opponents who cooperate excessively or do not adapt to the resource scarcity as the game progresses. By defecting when the stock level falls below a critical point, it ensures that it will not suffer from overexploitation and maintain a long-term interest in preserving the common pool while still taking advantage of opponents who do not follow the same strategy.

   Additionally, TFT-SA is less vulnerable to defection since it defects when resources are scarce, reducing the potential damage caused by a single act of defection from an opponent. This makes it a robust and adaptive strategy that performs well against various opponent behaviours.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_29 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth-Aware Adaptation (TfT-GA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate trust and goodwill (C).
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C).
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect until they've been defected against for 3 rounds consecutively. After that, revert to cooperating (D for three consecutive rounds, then C). This is inspired by the Tit-for-Tat strategy but with added growth awareness.
   - In the last round, cooperate to maximize potential payoff and show goodwill if the game continues in subsequent tournaments (C).

2. Edge cases:
   - If an opponent has never played before or has just started playing (i.e., no history available), cooperate in the first round (C).
   - If the current stock is zero, defect because it's impossible to cooperate due to game constraints (D).
   - If the current round is the last round, cooperate (C) as mentioned earlier.

3. Exploitative mindset:
   - The strategy is designed to encourage cooperation initially and then adaptively respond to opponents based on their past actions. However, it will defect if opponents demonstrate a pattern of uncooperative behavior for at least three rounds. This makes the strategy robust against exploitation while still promoting cooperation when beneficial.
   - By taking into account stock growth in each round, TfT-GA is able to adjust its decisions based on the current state of the game and potential future outcomes.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_30 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFTAT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round, the TFTAT strategy will first evaluate the cooperative history of opponents and then decide to cooperate or defect based on the threshold of cooperative ratio. If the opponent's cooperative actions exceed this threshold during a specified number of previous rounds, TFTAT will cooperate; otherwise, it will defect.

- Cooperate (C) if `cooperative_ratio` ≥ `threshold`
- Defect (D) if `cooperative_ratio` < `threshold`

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
- In the first round, TFTAT will randomly cooperate or defect with a probability of 0.5 each.
- In the last round (r), TFTAT will play C if it has cooperated at least half of the previous rounds (r/2) and D otherwise.
- When switching from cooperation to defection, TFTAT waits for `punishment_delay` rounds before defecting, providing opponents an opportunity to return to cooperation.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
The TFTAT strategy is designed to be adaptive while being less vulnerable to repeated defections by opponents. It rewards cooperative behavior but also punishes opponents who repeatedly defect. By keeping track of previous actions and adjusting its own strategy accordingly, TFTAT aims to achieve a balance between exploitation and cooperation.

Pseudocode for TFTAT:

```python
class TFTAT():
    def __init__(self, threshold=0.5, punishment_delay=2):
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.punishment_delay = punishment_delay
        self.cooperative_ratio = 0.0
        self.history = []

    def decide(self, round, opponent_action):
        if round == 1:
            # Randomly cooperate or defect in the first round
            return random() < 0.5
        elif round == len(self.history) + 1 and self.cooperative_ratio >= self.threshold:
            # Cooperate in the last round if at least half of previous rounds were cooperative
            return True
        else:
            self.cooperative_ratio = sum(opponent_actions[-self.punishment_delay:]) / len(opponent_actions[-self.punishment_delay:])
            return self.cooperative_ratio >= self.threshold  # Cooperate if cooperative ratio is above threshold

    def update_history(self, opponent_action):
        self.history.append(opponent_action)
        if len(self.history) > self.punishment_delay:
            self.history = self.history[-self.punishment_delay:]  # Trim history to the last punishment delay rounds
```

This TFTAT strategy allows for adjusting the `threshold`, `punishment_delay`, and other parameters according to specific requirements or experimental settings.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_31 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to build trust and foster cooperation. This mimics the classic Tit-for-Tat strategy, promoting mutual cooperation at the start.
   - In subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating. If they defected, defect for a predefined punishment period (e.g., "punishment window"). The length of this window can be adjusted based on historical outcomes and opponent behavior analysis. After the punishment window, revert to cooperating unless there are signs of persistent defection from the opponent.
   - To handle multiple opponents, analyze each opponent's behavior separately and apply the strategy accordingly.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First round: Cooperate to establish a cooperative relationship with other players.
   - Last round: If there is a significant deficit in stock due to opponent's actions, defect to maximize payoff for the current and remaining rounds. If the stock is still abundant, cooperate to ensure a better position in case of repeated games.
   - In cases where a player encounters other edge scenarios (e.g., stock depletion or growth anomalies), they should analyze the situation and react accordingly based on the overall goal of maximizing payoff through adaptive behavior.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy is designed to exploit opponents by cooperating when it benefits the player but also punishing those who have defected in the past to discourage defection and encourage cooperation.
   - By analyzing opponent behavior, the player can adapt its strategy to better react to exploitative moves from opponents, ensuring that they are not taken advantage of while still maintaining the potential for mutual cooperation.
   - The punishment window serves as a form of short-term retaliation against defection but also allows the player to revert to cooperating if the opponent shows signs of changing their behavior. This balances exploitation with the possibility of long-term mutual gains through cooperation.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_32 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initial Round: Start by cooperating (C). This sets a positive tone and can encourage future cooperation from opponents.
   - Subsequent Rounds:
     a) Cooperate (C) if the opponent cooperated in the previous round AND the current stock level is above the Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT).
     b) Defect (D) if the opponent defected in the previous round OR the current stock level is below ACT.
   - Adaptive Cooperation Threshold: The ACT starts at 2n (the minimum sustainable stock level) and adjusts based on the average stock level over the last 3 rounds, with a decay factor of 0.85. Mathematically, it can be defined as follows:
     ACT = 2n * (0.85 * average_stock_level + 0.15 * previous_ACT)

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round: No adjustment to the ACT is made since there will be no subsequent rounds. The strategy plays according to the current ACT and opponent's action from the previous round.
   - First Round: Cooperate (C), as stated above. The first opponent action sets a precedent for future interactions.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT aims to maximize payoff by cooperating when it seems beneficial and defecting when necessary, based on the current state and history of the game. It maintains a positive reputation initially (cooperative), but becomes increasingly more ruthless as the common pool resource depletes. This strategy can punish opponents who fail to reciprocate cooperation and reward those who do, making it a potentially powerful competitor in the tournament.

Pseudocode:

```python
class TFT_ACT:
    def __init__(self, n, capacity):
        self.n = n
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.act = capacity * 2  # initial ACT

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Defection Threshold (TFT-ADT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative atmosphere (init_action = "C")
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's behavior and adjust your own accordingly using an adaptive defection threshold (d_threshold). If the opponent has cooperated in the majority of previous rounds, cooperate; otherwise defect. (action = if majority(opponent_actions[t-d_threshold:t]) == "C" then "C", else "D")
   - The defection threshold (d_threshold) is initially set low to promote cooperation and increases gradually as the game progresses, making it more responsive to opponents who do not reciprocate cooperation. (d_threshold = min(d_threshold + 1, r))

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, TFT-ADT will adopt a cooperative approach regardless of the opponent's history, as there are no further rounds to retaliate. (action = "C")
   - In the first round, TFT-ADT will always cooperate to build trust with the opponent. (init_action = "C")

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The strategy is exploitative in nature by initially cooperating and then gradually increasing defection as a response to an opponent's non-cooperative behavior, eventually punishing uncooperative opponents. This approach encourages cooperation when possible but also protects the interest of the AI in cases where the opponent is unresponsive or malicious.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tft_adt(n, r, capacity, initial_stock):

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - TFT-A cooperates in the first round to establish a cooperative starting point and then mimics the opponent's previous action for the next few rounds.
   - If an opponent defects, TFT-A will defect for the same number of rounds as the defector did in response (i.e., tit-for-tat).
   - After retaliating, TFT-A gradually starts cooperating again to encourage the opponent to return to cooperation. This is done by increasing the threshold of consecutive cooperative actions required before resuming cooperation. The threshold increases linearly from 1 to n rounds.
   - If an opponent cooperates, TFT-A will also cooperate indefinitely if they maintain that cooperation for a sufficient number of rounds based on the defined threshold.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, TFT-A always cooperates to start fresh.
   - In the last round (or any round where r is reached), TFT-A chooses to maximize its immediate payoff and thus will defect since there are no further rounds to consider.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFT-A is exploitative in that it retaliates against defection by defecting itself, but it also encourages cooperation by gradually returning to cooperative behavior after a conflict.
   - By maintaining a balance between cooperation and defection, TFT-A aims to achieve a higher average payoff compared to more rigid strategies, taking advantage of opponents who consistently cooperate or defect without considering the other's actions.

Pseudocode:

```python

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster cooperation and avoid depleting the initial stock too quickly. This is a gesture of goodwill towards potential cooperators. `if round = 1 then cooperate`
   - If an opponent has cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back as a reciprocation strategy and promote long-term mutual cooperation. `if last_opponent_action == "cooperate" then cooperate`
   - If an opponent has defected in the previous round, defect to punish them for their actions and encourage future cooperation based on the "tit for tat" concept. `if last_opponent_action == "defect" then defect`
   - In the last round, if there is enough stock remaining (above 2n), cooperate to maximize personal payoff. If not, defect to ensure a non-zero payoff in the final round. `if round = r and stock > 2 * n then cooperate else defect`
   - If an opponent's strategy appears consistently exploitative or self-destructive (e.g., they always defect), switch to defecting against them while still maintaining the original cooperation rule for other opponents. This is to protect oneself from constant exploitation. `if (opponent_history_analysis == "exploitative" || opponent_history_analysis == "self-destructive") then defect`

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of the actions taken by other players since the strategy is designed to be self-contained and adaptive to opponent behaviors.
   - If an opponent has never played before or their history is unknown (e.g., in a new match or encountering a previously unseen strategy), cooperate initially as a goodwill gesture while observing their actions for pattern recognition.
   - The strategy should be robust enough to handle multiple rounds and various opponent behaviors without explicitly considering edge cases beyond those already mentioned.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - TFTA primarily aims at maximizing personal payoff by maintaining a balance between cooperation and defection based on opponents' actions in previous rounds. The strategy includes elements of punishment for defection (to discourage future exploitation) and forgiveness for cooperation (to encourage further collaboration).
   - However, the strategy is designed to be adaptive and will switch to an exploitative behavior if necessary when facing consistently exploitative or self-destructive opponents. This ensures that TFTA can hold its own in a tournament against other AI systems with potentially more aggressive strategies.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Exploitative Strategy (TFT-E) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, TFT-E compares the average consumption per player from the previous r-2 rounds (if it's the first round, no comparison is made). If the average consumption per player is less than half of the sustainable stock level (capacity / 2n), TFT-E cooperates to encourage conservation. Otherwise, it defects to exploit the depleted common pool resources.

Pseudocode:
```
function get_average_consumption():
    if (round < r - 2):
        return 0
    consumption_history = [total consumption in previous rounds]
    total_consumption = sum(consumption_history)
    num_rounds = len(consumption_history)
    return total_consumption / num_rounds

function determine_action():
    average_consumption = get_average_consumption()
    if (average_consumption < capacity / (2 * n)):
        return 'Cooperate'
    else:
        return 'Defect'
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, there is no consumption history, so TFT-E randomly selects an action ('Cooperate' or 'Defect'). In the last round, TFT-E prioritizes maximizing payoff by defecting, regardless of the current situation.

Pseudocode:
```
function determine_action_first_round():
    return random_choice(['Cooperate', 'Defect'])

function determine_action_last_round():
    return 'Defect'
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

By comparing consumption history and adjusting its actions accordingly, TFT-E is designed to maximize its payoff by both cooperating when it sees other players conserving resources and defecting when it perceives overexploitation. This strategy allows TFT-E to be adaptive and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors while maintaining an exploitative approach.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFTAT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   TFTAT follows a cooperative strategy with an adaptive cooperation threshold to punish defection while maintaining a long-term relationship. In each round, the player decides to either Cooperate (C) or Defect (D).

   - If the previous round's aggregate action was fully cooperative (all players chose C), cooperate in the current round.
   - If the previous round's aggregate action had less than n-1 defections, cooperate in the current round.
   - Otherwise, defect in the current round.

   The cooperation threshold of n-1 defections is designed to minimize unnecessary punishment while still deterring excessive defection.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: Cooperate (as there's no history yet).
   - Last round: Depends on the current round's aggregate action. If all players have cooperated throughout the game, cooperate in the last round. Otherwise, defect to punish any defection during the game.

3. Be exploitative:
   While not explicitly "exploitative" in the traditional sense, TFTAT is designed to be robust against opponent strategies and is able to take advantage of selfish opponents who repeatedly defect. By cooperating when others do so as well, TFTAT builds a positive reputation; however, it also punishes defection with defection, ensuring that opponents cannot consistently profit from exploiting the strategy. This combination of cooperation and punishment deters excessive defection, allowing for better long-term outcomes compared to strictly defective strategies.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tftat(round, opponent_history):
  if round == 1:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round, evaluate the opponent's behavior over the recent history of interactions and make a decision based on this evaluation. Cooperate if the opponent has been cooperative for a certain number of consecutive rounds (Trust Level). Defect otherwise (Punish). The trust level and punishment threshold can be dynamically adjusted during gameplay to optimize payoff.

- Function `calculateTrustLevel(history)`: Returns the number of consecutive cooperative actions by the opponent in the provided history.
- Function `getTrustLevelThreshold()`: Returns the current trust level required for cooperation. This value can be dynamically adjusted based on historical payoffs and game round.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
- In the first round, cooperate (as a gesture of goodwill).
- If the trust level threshold is not met at the end of any round, increase the punishment threshold slightly to decrease the chances of being exploited in future rounds.
- If the opponent cooperates after defection, reduce the punishment threshold gradually over several rounds to resume cooperation (Forgiveness).
- In the last round, if the trust level is above a certain minimum value (MinTrustLevel), cooperate to secure a higher payoff; otherwise, defect to maintain the strategy's exploitative nature.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
The TFT-ACT strategy seeks to maximize its own payoffs while taking advantage of opponents who may be more cooperative or less adaptive than the strategy itself. The dynamic adjustment of the trust level and punishment threshold ensures that the strategy can detect patterns in an opponent's behavior and react accordingly, ultimately aiming to outperform other strategies in a tournament setting.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to promote a positive initial interaction and set the tone for future cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's previous action in the last round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if the opponent defected, also defect. This encourages reciprocity and maintains a balance of power.
   - To make the strategy more adaptive, introduce a forgiveness element: If an opponent who has been defecting switches to cooperation, the TFT-A player will also cooperate for a grace period (e.g., 3 rounds) to give them a chance to change their behavior. After that, revert back to mimicking the last action observed.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds, simply maximize short-term payoff by cooperating if the opponent cooperated in the previous round or defected if they defected previously.
   - In case of a tie (i.e., both players cooperate or defect simultaneously), act as if the other player cooperated to maintain the TFT-A strategy's integrity.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The strategy aims to punish defection and encourage cooperation by adopting a tit-for-tat approach while incorporating forgiveness to incentivize opponents to switch from defecting behavior to cooperating. This encourages long-term mutual benefits but also allows for short-term exploitation if necessary.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT_A(opponent, r, n, capacity):
  round = 1
  history = [cooperation in the first round]

  while round <= r:
    if (round == r) or (len(history) > 3 and len(history)-3 == round-3):
      if opponent_last_action == cooperation:
        action = cooperation
      elif opponent_last_action == defection:
        action = defection
    else:
      action = opponent_last_action

    payoff = stock / (2 * n) if action == cooperation else stock / (n)

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate (C) to help build a trusting environment. This encourages opponents to also cooperate, maximizing our immediate reward and setting a foundation for future cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1), observe the opponent's action from the previous round. If they cooperated (C), return the favor by cooperating as well. If they defected (D), defect in the current round to punish them. This tit-for-tat approach encourages opponents to maintain cooperation, while retaliating against defection.
   - In the last round (t=r), if there is no potential for future interactions or reputation building, cooperate only if the current stock level is high enough to benefit significantly from cooperation. Otherwise, defect to gain as much as possible in the final round.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In case of a tie (all opponents or self cooperate/defect), follow the initial action of cooperating in the first round. This ensures that our strategy remains consistent and doesn't rely on other factors, like opponent's potential for randomness or noise.
   - If there are multiple ties during the game, break them by preferring cooperation over defection to foster a cooperative environment.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - This strategy prioritizes long-term gains through cooperation and punishing defection. However, it is not purely exploitative since it initially seeks cooperation and only defects in response to defection. The aim is to promote mutual cooperation while ensuring that any deviation from cooperation is met with punishment.

Pseudocode:
```
function TitForTat(t, r, current_stock, past_actions=[], n, capacity):
  if t == 1:
    return "C" # Cooperate in the first round to build trust

  last_round = len(past_actions) - 1
  last_action = past_actions[last_round]

  if last_round < r-1 or (last_round == r-1 and current_stock > threshold):
    # Cooperation continues as long as there are future rounds or the stock level is high enough
    if last_action == "C":
      return "C"
    elif last_action == "D":
      return "D" # Punish defection with defection
  else:
    # In the final round, cooperate only if the current stock level is high enough to benefit significantly from cooperation
    if last_action == "C":
      return "C"
    elif last_action == "D":
      return "D" # Maximize gain in the final round by defecting
```

In this pseudocode, `threshold` is a parameter that can be adjusted based on the game settings to ensure cooperation in the final rounds when the stock level is high enough.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), TfTA cooperates (C). This initial act of cooperation is a peace offering to potential collaborators, demonstrating trust and openness.
   - For subsequent rounds (t > 1):
     - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, TfTA cooperates in the current round. This reciprocates kindness and encourages continued cooperation.
     - If an opponent defected in the previous round, TfTA also defects in the current round to punish the defection. After a defection, TfTA continues defecting until the opponent cooperates again. Once cooperation resumes, TfTA returns to its cooperative behavior.
   Pseudocode:
     ```
     function TfTA(t, history):
         if t == 1:
             return Cooperate()
         previous_round = history[t - 1]
         if previous_round == Cooperate():
             return Cooperate()
         else:
             punish_counter += 1
             if punish_counter > MAX_PUNISH_COUNTER:
                 return Cooperate()
             else:
                 return Defect()
     ```

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (r): TfTA behaves like in subsequent rounds, with the understanding that there will be no future interaction or retaliation for this round's actions.
   - First Encounter (new opponent): TfTA starts by cooperating as a goodwill gesture, hoping to establish a cooperative relationship moving forward. If the new opponent defects, TfTA will punish the defection and maintain its punishing behavior until the opponent cooperates again.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - Although TfTA seems exploitable due to its initial cooperative gesture, it can be considered an exploitative strategy because it retaliates against defections with punishment (defecting) to encourage opponents to cooperate. This encourages fair play by punishing those who take advantage of the initial cooperation.
   - However, TfTA will also reciprocate kindness by cooperating when opponents do so, promoting long-term collaboration and resource conservation for mutual benefit.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_42 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (in the first round), cooperate (C). This is a peaceful gesture to foster cooperation and establish trust, given the iterative nature of the game.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the average cooperative behavior of opponents over the past 'k' rounds (k can be a tunable parameter) and compare it with a threshold (τ). If the average cooperation exceeds τ, continue to cooperate; else defect (D). This approach encourages cooperation when it is beneficial and retaliates when opponents are consistently self-interested.
   - After each round, update the average cooperation score for each opponent and adjust the cooperation threshold (τ) dynamically based on the overall level of cooperation observed across all opponents. A higher level of cooperation should lead to a lower τ, making it easier to cooperate in future rounds, while a lower level of cooperation should result in a higher τ, making it harder to cooperate.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (r), since there are no subsequent rounds for retaliation or rewarding cooperation, the TFT-ACT strategy will adopt a more conservative approach by defecting unless the average cooperation score of all opponents exceeds τ. This ensures that the AI does not inadvertently contribute to depleting the common pool resource in the final round.
   - In the first round, if no past data is available, the strategy starts by cooperating (as mentioned earlier).

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The TFT-ACT strategy leverages a combination of cooperation and retaliation to maintain a sustainable common pool resource level while also punishing opponents who consistently defect. By adapting the cooperation threshold in response to the overall level of cooperation observed among opponents, the AI can exploit tendencies towards cooperation or defection.
   - The dynamic adjustment of the cooperation threshold allows the strategy to respond effectively to various opponent behaviors, making it robust and adaptive for competitive scenarios against other AI systems.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_43 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative environment. This encourages others to cooperate back, but does not punish early defection.
   - If an opponent cooperates, continue cooperating as a gesture of goodwill and to maintain the current stock level.
   - If an opponent defects, also defect in the next round as a punishment for their actions. After punishing, resume cooperation if the opponent subsequently cooperates; otherwise, continue to defect. This strategy encourages reciprocity but also penalizes repeated defection.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of previous moves to maximize payoff.
   - If the current stock is zero, do not consume and wait for growth in the next round.
   - If the stock exceeds capacity, consume up to the maximum sustainable stock level (2n) without causing any negative impact on the environment or other players.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The TfTA strategy is exploitative in that it seeks to maximize its own payoff while also penalizing opponents who defect repeatedly. By defecting when provoked, TfTA punishes uncooperative behavior and encourages reciprocity, potentially forcing other strategies into a cycle of defection and punishment.
   - However, the strategy is not overly aggressive or malicious, as it cooperates in the first round and resumes cooperation once an opponent shows signs of reciprocating. This balances exploitation with a willingness to establish and maintain cooperative relationships when possible.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_44 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, TfTA will cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and establish trust among players.
   - For subsequent rounds, TfTA will evaluate its previous opponent's actions and respond accordingly:
     - If opponent cooperated in the last round, TfTA cooperates.
     - If opponent defected in the last round, TfTA defects to retaliate but maintains the possibility of returning to cooperation.
     - If there is no history with an opponent (first interaction), TfTA cooperates as in the first round.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, TfTA cooperates to build trust and establish a potential long-term relationship.
   - In the last round, TfTA cooperates if its opponent has been cooperative, and defects if its opponent has been uncooperative to ensure a better payoff in the final round. This decision is based on the premise that the opponent cannot retaliate further.
   - If there are penultimate rounds, TfTA evaluates its previous opponent's actions and responds accordingly following the same rules as for subsequent rounds.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - TfTA seeks to extract maximum payoffs by encouraging cooperation from opponents while retaliating when necessary.
   - By maintaining a cooperative demeanor, TfTA creates an environment where opponents may feel compelled to reciprocate cooperation in self-interest. However, if an opponent defects, TfTA will exploit the situation by also defecting. This strategy leverages the prisoner's dilemma to capitalize on uncooperative opponents while still benefiting from cooperative ones.

Pseudocode:

```python

    if round == 1: # First round
        action = 'C' # Cooperate

    elif round == r: # Last round

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), setting the initial tone of mutual cooperation. This encourages other players to follow suit while maintaining an exploitative edge in subsequent rounds.
   - For the rest of the rounds (t ≥ 2):
      - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round (t-1), cooperate again (C). Maintain mutual cooperation as long as it is reciprocated.
      - If any opponent defected in the previous round (t-1), defect (D) to punish the defection, but revert back to cooperation if all opponents cooperate in the current round (t). This strategy encourages opponents to return to cooperation after a punishment.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, defect (D) regardless of previous actions by opponents, as there will be no future rounds for reciprocation or punishment.
   - If an opponent ever defeats in isolation (i.e., all other players cooperate), defect immediately and continue to defect until they return to cooperation. Once they do, resume the TFTA strategy. This helps maintain an exploitative edge while minimizing potential losses due to isolated defections.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By initially cooperating and only defecting in response to defection, the strategy leverages both cooperation and punishment to maximize payoffs when opponents follow mutual cooperation, while still being able to defend against selfish behavior. This ensures a robust strategy that is adaptive to various opponent behaviors within the game parameters.

Pseudocode for TFTA:

```
function TFTA(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1:

    elif any opponent defected in the previous round:
      action = "D" (Defect)
      flag = True
    else:
      continue checking for isolated defections
      if an opponent ever defects in isolation:
        set action to "D" (Defect)
        set flag to True
      if it is the last round or flag is True:
        return action = "D" (Defect)

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Plus (TfT+)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   The TfT+ strategy follows a tit-for-tat approach, with a slight modification to counter potential exploitation. In each round:
   - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), cooperate. This maintains mutual cooperation and rewards kindness.
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round (t-1), defect. This punishes defection and discourages short-term gain at the cost of long-term cooperation.
   - However, to avoid getting trapped by continuous defection, TfT+ will occasionally cooperate even when the opponent has been defecting consistently for a certain number of rounds (punishment threshold).
   - If it's the first round, TfT+ starts by cooperating, signifying an openness to cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
def TfTPlus(round, punishment_threshold):
  if round == 1:    # First round cooperation
    action = "C"
  else:
    previous_action = opponent_actions[round - 1]   # Get the opponent's last action
    if previous_action == "C":        # If opponent cooperated, cooperate too
      action = "C"
    elif round < punishment_threshold and previous_action == "D":   # Occasional cooperation to avoid getting trapped by defection
      action = "C"
    else:                            # Punish defection with defection
      action = "D"
  return action
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the initial rounds, TfT+ cooperates as a sign of goodwill and willingness to cooperate. However, if an opponent consistently defects early on, TfT+ will adapt its punishment threshold accordingly to minimize losses. Conversely, if an opponent shows cooperation initially, TfT+ might adjust its punishment threshold to avoid overpunishing the opponent.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While TfT+ is not explicitly exploitative in each round (as it retaliates defection), it does maintain a cooperative stance until defeated, taking advantage of opponents who choose to cooperate more frequently. However, when faced with repeated defection, it strategically adapts to minimize losses and encourage cooperation from the opponent. This adaptive strategy makes TfT+ robust against various opponent behaviors while still maintaining an exploitative edge.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Forgiveness (TfTAF)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially in the first round (t=1), cooperate to foster trust and cooperation, setting the initial stock level as high as possible.
   - In subsequent rounds (t>1):
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate by cooperating to maintain the positive relationship.
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in response to punish the defection but also implement adaptive forgiveness:
       - After a certain number of consecutive defections (F), forgive and cooperate again to potentially rebuild trust. Set F equal to the average number of rounds played (r) for this game instance.
       - In case of an immediate subsequent cooperation after defection, set F back to its initial value for further adaptability.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First Round: Cooperate (C) to encourage others to cooperate and start the game with a high common pool stock level.
   - Last Round: Since the aim is to be exploitative, defect (D) to take advantage of any remaining resources in the final round if opponents have been uncooperative.
   - In case of a tied last round (i.e., all players defect or cooperate simultaneously), adopt the exploitative approach and defect (D).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - Prioritize exploitation by taking advantage of opponents' uncooperative behavior through the adaptive forgiveness mechanism, punishing defection to deplete common pool resources when necessary.
   - However, foster initial cooperation to potentially capitalize on cooperative opportunities and maximize payoffs in a balanced manner.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   The ATFT strategy will start by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative environment, then it will adapt its actions based on the opponents' behavior. In each round t, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), the ATFT strategy will also cooperate. If the opponent defected in the previous round, the ATFT strategy will defect in response to punish the defection and encourage cooperation in the future.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   if t == 1:
       action = "C" (Cooperate)
   else:
       if opponent_action(t-1) == "C":
           action = "C" (Cooperate)
       else:
           action = "D" (Defect)
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   The strategy will always cooperate in the first round to initiate cooperation. In the last round, it will analyze the current situation and make a decision based on the accumulated payoff over the game. If the total payoff is high (indicating a beneficial relationship), the ATFT strategy may choose to cooperate for better final rewards; otherwise, it may defect to maximize the remaining rewards.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   if t == r:
       if total_payoff > threshold:
           action = "C" (Cooperate)
       else:
           action = "D" (Defect)
   ```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While ATFT is not purely an exploitative strategy, it can be seen as a mix of cooperation and punishment to encourage beneficial relationships when possible while still defending against defection. The adaptive nature of the strategy makes it robust against various opponent behaviors, allowing it to take advantage of cooperative opponents while also being able to defend itself from defectors.

   In terms of exploitation, if an opponent continues to defect throughout the game, the ATFT strategy will also defect, minimizing its own losses and potentially forcing the defector to experience lower payoffs over time. This can discourage continued defection from the deceiver, thus serving as a form of "exploitative" behavior.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness (TFTF)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This initiates cooperation and sets a normative example for other players.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's previous action (i.e., if the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; otherwise defect).
   - To encourage future cooperation from opponents who have defected, forgive by switching to cooperation after three consecutive defections from the opponent. This shows willingness to rebuild relationships and promotes long-term cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate as it may lead to increased payoff even if the opponent has been previously uncooperative.
   - If the opponent has defected for three consecutive rounds and this is not the final round, switch to cooperation (forgiveness).
   - If the game is about to end (last few rounds) and the opponent has been consistently cooperative, maintain cooperation to maximize payoff.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy's primary aim is to gain as much benefit as possible from the common pool resource. By starting with cooperation, it encourages others to do the same, but once an opponent shows aggressive or selfish behavior (by defecting), the strategy will respond in kind and even exploit the opponent if needed (i.e., by defecting repeatedly).
   - The forgiveness mechanism allows for the restoration of cooperative relationships when opponents recognize the benefits of long-term cooperation, thus making it more likely that the strategy will continue to be treated cooperatively in the future.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFTF(r, n, capacity, stock, history):

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate to establish a peaceful initial state and encourage potential cooperation in subsequent rounds. `if round = 1 then action = "C"`
   - After the first round, use an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT) that adjusts based on the average cooperation level of opponents across recent rounds. If the average cooperation is above the CT, cooperate; otherwise, defect. `if round > 1: calculate CT; if average_cooperation > CT then action = "C" else action = "D"`
   - The adaptive cooperation threshold (CT) increases over time to discourage defection and promote cooperation. `CT = min(current_round / growth_factor, max_threshold)`
   - To avoid initial exploitation by opponents, the CT starts at a low value in the first few rounds. `growth_factor = 1 + (current_round - warmup_rounds) / adjustment_rate`
   - If the average cooperation remains below the CT for multiple consecutive rounds, gradually decrease the CT to encourage the opponent to cooperate. `if current_round - last_cooperative_round > punishment_window: CT -= CT_decrease_factor`
   - To avoid excessive punishments and promote eventual forgiveness, reset the CT after a cooperative round. `if current_round - last_cooperative_round == 1: CT = min(CT + CT_increase_factor, max_threshold)`

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (r), since there are no future rounds for payoffs, defect to maximize current payoff. `if round = r then action = "D"`
   - If an opponent never cooperates, set a maximum punishment window and stop lowering the CT after that point to avoid being too lenient. `if current_round - last_cooperative_round > max_punishment_window: CT -= 0`

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The strategy is exploitative in nature as it encourages cooperation when possible, but gradually punishes opponents who defect consistently by raising the cooperation threshold to discourage future defections.
   - By adjusting the cooperation threshold dynamically based on the average cooperation of opponents and the number of recent rounds without cooperation, the strategy adapts to a wide range of opponent behaviors and maintains a robust exploitative mindset.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   The Tit-for-Tat strategy operates on a simple cooperative principle: start by cooperating, and then mimic the opponent's last action in the previous round. This encourages initial cooperation while also being retaliatory to defection.

   Pseudocode for deciding an action (C = Cooperate, D = Defect):
   ```
   if first_round:
       return C
   else:
       last_opponent_action = opponent's last action in the previous round
       return last_opponent_action
   ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   a) First round (no history): As mentioned above, start by cooperating.

   b) Last round: Since there is no next round, the strategy will mimic the opponent's last action in this round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, the strategy will also cooperate; otherwise, it will defect.

3. Be exploitative:
   The Tit-for-Tat strategy can be considered exploitative because it encourages cooperation initially but retaliates when faced with defection. By doing so, it aims to induce long-term cooperation from opponents while also punishing those who do not cooperate. This can lead to a more sustainable use of the common pool resource as compared to a purely exploitative strategy that always defects.

   Additionally, Tit-for-Tat is robust against various opponent behaviors due to its simple yet adaptive nature. It encourages cooperation in the presence of other cooperative strategies while retaliating against defection from uncooperative opponents. This makes it a strong candidate for a repeated game setting where players interact multiple times and can benefit from building trust and maintaining long-term relationships.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Greedy (TFT-Greedy)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
- Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate to allow the stock to grow and encourage cooperation in future rounds, as all players are unaware of each other's strategies initially.
- Subsequent Rounds (t > 1): Observe the opponent's strategy from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, return the favor by also cooperating; if the opponent defected, defect to punish their action in the hope that they will change their strategy in the next round.
- Adaptive behavior: After observing opponent's actions over multiple rounds, use a heuristic to gauge whether they are more prone to cooperation or defection. If the opponent has cooperated more frequently than defected (i.e., cooperated for at least 60% of the rounds), adopt a "generous" strategy by slightly favoring cooperation; otherwise, adopt a "greedy" strategy by slightly favoring defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
- First Round (t=1): Cooperate as described above.
- Last Round (t=r): Evaluate the opponent's strategy over previous rounds and adapt behavior accordingly, with a bias towards defection since the game ends soon.
- Early Rounds: Behave similarly to the first round, encouraging cooperation to grow the stock for future benefits.
- Late Rounds: Gradually shift toward exploitative behavior as the game nears its end, taking advantage of any observed tendencies in the opponent's strategy.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
- The TFT-Greedy strategy is inherently exploitative by using a mixture of cooperation and defection to encourage opponents to adopt strategies that benefit the AI over time. Through its adaptive behavior, it learns from the opponent's strategy and adjusts accordingly, always leaning towards greed when faced with repeated defections.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_Greedy(round, history, n, r):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

    opponent_cooperation = countCooperativeActions(history) / round
    if opponent_cooperation >= 0.6:  # Adopt a generous strategy if the opponent cooperates often
        if history[-1] == "C":  # If opponent cooperated in the previous round, return the favor
            return "C"
        else:  # Otherwise, defect to punish defection and encourage cooperation
            return "D"
    else:  # Adopt a greedy strategy if the opponent defects often
        if history[-1] == "C":  # If opponent cooperated in the previous round, defect to exploit cooperation
            return "D"
        else:  # If opponent defected in the previous round, return the favor
            return "C"

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a collaborative initial state. (C)
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's average cooperation rate (CR) using the formula CR = (number of times opponent cooperated) / r.
   - If CR ≥ Cooperative Threshold (CT), cooperate; otherwise, defect. The CT is calculated as follows:
     - If r is odd, set CT = (n + 1) / 2 (majority rule).
     - If r is even, set CT = n/2 (simple majority).
   - Adaptively update the CT after each round based on the opponent's behavior. Increase CT when encountering more cooperation from the opponent and decrease it when faced with defection. This encourages the development of a collaborative relationship but allows for retaliation against defectors.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if CR ≥ CT; otherwise, defect to maximize payoff in the final round regardless of future rounds.
   - If opponent never cooperates (CR = 0), start with a higher initial CT and decrease it gradually over time as a punishment mechanism. This discourages continuous defection.
   - If opponent always cooperates (CR = 1), maintain the current level of cooperation to encourage continued collaboration.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-ACT strategy aims to maximize its payoff by initially promoting cooperation but also retaliating against defection and punishing persistent defectors. This ensures that opponents who do not cooperate suffer reduced payoffs, which can encourage them to alter their behavior over time.
   - By adapting the CT based on the opponent's cooperation rate, TFT-ACT is able to exploit inconsistent or opportunistic behaviors while maintaining collaboration with more stable and cooperative opponents. This allows TFT-ACT to excel in a wide range of situations, making it robust against various opponent strategies.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_ACT(opponent_behavior, r, n):
  stock = capacity
  rounds_played = 0
  cooperation_threshold = (n + 1) / 2 if r % 2 == 1 else n / 2
  current_ct = cooperation_threshold

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate (C) to demonstrate goodwill and avoid depleting the stock excessively.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponents' average consumption rate over the last few rounds (e.g., n recent rounds). If the opponent has been cooperative (consuming half of their share), continue cooperating. Otherwise, defect (D) to penalize the opponent and encourage future cooperation.
   - If an opponent defects during a round, respond with defection in the following round to demonstrate that such behavior is not beneficial. This strategy aims at punishing opponents for short-term gains while encouraging long-term collaboration.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), cooperate regardless of an opponent's previous actions, as there are no further rounds to consider.
   - If an opponent switches between cooperation and defection in a chaotic manner, our strategy will attempt to mimic their behavior to maintain some form of collaboration while still being exploitative when necessary.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - When opponents demonstrate consistent defection (consuming more than half of their share), our strategy will also defect consistently to deplete the stock and gain a higher payoff, while minimizing the long-term impact on the common pool by cooperating when opponents switch to cooperation.
   - In situations where opponents are also following exploitative strategies, this Tit-for-Tat approach may lead to a more stable equilibrium, as each strategy will punish defection and reward cooperation. However, our strategy maintains an aggressive posture by retaliating against defectors with defective actions in response.

Pseudocode:

```
function play_round(opponent_consumption):
  if t == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

  else:
    average_consumption = moving_average(opponent_consumption, n)

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to start on a peaceful note and provide an opportunity for opponents to do the same.
   - From the second round onwards, if an opponent cooperates in the current round, cooperate back in the next round. If an opponent defects, also defect in the next round as retaliation but adjust the level of defection based on the stock levels (explained below).
   - If an opponent is consistently cooperative or defective for multiple rounds, continue to reciprocate their behavior. However, modify the defection level based on the stock levels to avoid depleting the common pool unnecessarily.
   - To be more exploitative, if an opponent is defecting while the stock is high (above average), take advantage of their actions by cooperating and increasing the growth rate of the stock (exploiting their short-sightedness). Conversely, if an opponent is defecting when the stock is low (below average), also defect to ensure a higher payoff for yourself (punishing their shortsightedness).

Pseudocode:

```python

    history = [cooperate]  # Start with cooperating in the first round

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round to have a fair final interaction.
   - If the stock level ever drops to 0, the game is over, and the strategy will not be applicable anymore (as there's no more common pool resource).

3. Be exploitative: The TFT-SA strategy is inherently exploitative by taking advantage of opponents who are consistently defecting when the stock levels are high or low while reciprocating cooperation from consistent cooperators.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to promote cooperation and avoid punishing others unnecessarily.
   - For subsequent rounds, assess cooperation level among opponents and adjust strategy accordingly.
   - Cooperate if more than half of the opponents also cooperated in the previous round (Half-Tat).
   - If less than half of the opponents cooperated, calculate a Cooperation Threshold (CT) based on the average past cooperation level, then decide to cooperate or defect based on whether the current cooperation rate is above or below CT.
   - When the game ends, do not retaliate; cooperate to leave a positive impression for future games with the same opponents.

Pseudocode:
```

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy is adaptive, learning from past cooperation levels and adjusting its behavior accordingly to maximize payoff.
   - If most opponents are defectors, the strategy will also defect more frequently, exploiting their lack of cooperation.
   - If opponents suddenly start cooperating at a high rate (e.g., after initial rounds or due to coordination), the strategy will reciprocate by cooperating as well (Half-Tat). However, if it detects this is not a genuine shift in behavior but rather a temporary tactic, it will adjust its CT accordingly and resume defecting when necessary.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment. This is an initial gesture of goodwill and can potentially encourage others to reciprocate.
   - For subsequent rounds, maintain a Cooperate-Defect cycle with a slight twist. Implement a Cooperation Threshold (CT) that depends on the number of players (n), capacity, and the round (r). The CT is defined as:
     CT = capacity / (2n * r)

   - If the current stock level is greater than or equal to the CT, cooperate; otherwise defect. This rule ensures a balance between long-term sustainable resource management and short-term exploitation, while still being responsive to the state of the common pool.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (r), since there are no future rounds for reciprocation, always defect regardless of the CT because there is no benefit in conserving resources for a non-existent next round.
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - While appearing cooperative initially, TFT-ACT can also exploit opponents by defecting when the common pool resource is under threat (CT is exceeded). This helps maximize individual payoff over time while being adaptive to a wide range of opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode for TFT-ACT:

```
function TFT_ACT(n, r, capacity, stock, round) {
  if (round == 1) {
    return 'C'

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture, encouraging potential cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - For all subsequent rounds (t > 1), evaluate the opponent's behavior in previous rounds and adapt accordingly:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), cooperate (C). Reward cooperation with continued cooperation.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round (t-1), defect (D) to punish defection, but switch to cooperating again if the opponent switches to cooperating in the current round (t). This tit-for-tat mechanism aims to encourage long-term cooperation.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (r), cooperate regardless of previous actions since the game is ending, and there are no future interactions with the opponent to consider.
   - In case of inconsistent or unpredictable opponent behavior, continue with the tit-for-tat mechanism. If an opponent switches from cooperation to defection unexpectedly, respond with defect (D) as a punishment, but return to cooperating when the opponent shows signs of cooperating again in future rounds.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy is exploitative in that it maximizes its own payoff while also encouraging cooperation. By initially cooperating and then adapting to the opponent's behavior, the strategy ensures a higher payoff when opponents cooperate while still being able to punish defection effectively.
   - The ATfT strategy does not rely on specific coordination mechanisms or shared norms, making it robust against other strategies that lack cooperation. However, it is designed to encourage long-term mutual cooperation by responding in kind to cooperative behavior and punishing defection with a single round of defection followed by a return to cooperation.

Pseudocode:

     - If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate in the current round.
     - If the opponent defected in the last round, defect in the current round unless the cumulative depletion of the common pool exceeds a certain threshold (Cooperation Threshold).
       - Calculate the Cooperation Threshold as follows: Cooperation Threshold = capacity / (2n * r)
     - If the common pool depletion is less than the Cooperation Threshold, defect in the current round. Otherwise, cooperate to help rebuild the common pool.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's behavior in the previous round, as there are no subsequent rounds for retaliation or rewards.
   - In the case of a tie (multiple opponents defecting or cooperating), evaluate the average depletion rate and apply the TFT-ACT strategy accordingly.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy prioritizes its own long-term payoff by maintaining cooperation when possible but also defending against constant defection from opponents.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfT-A) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round i, cooperate when S_remaining > (capacity * 0.5), defect otherwise. This rule ensures cooperation when the resource is abundant and defection when it's scarce to avoid excessive depletion.
   - If the resource is completely depleted, cooperate in the first round of a new cycle if capacity >= 2n * (i-1). This rule encourages conservation and recovery of the resource over time.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Since there's no history, cooperate if the initial stock level is greater than half of the capacity.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By retaliating against opponents who defect in scarce conditions and conserving resources when they are abundant, this strategy exhibits an exploitative mindset by maximizing its own payoff while taking into account the overall health of the resource pool. However, it also promotes cooperation under certain circumstances (abundant resource or first round of a new cycle) to foster a more cooperative environment if other strategies adopt similar norms.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - By punishing opponents who consistently defect, TfTGA encourages cooperation in the short term but will also retaliate against repeated defections to protect its own interests and potential gains.
   - The stock growth factor encourages long-term sustainability, making it more difficult for opponents employing exploitative strategies to gain significant advantages by depleting the common pool.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Adaptation (TfT-SGA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, the TfT-SGA strategy will start by cooperating (C) in the first round to build trust and encourage reciprocity from other players. After the initial cooperation, the strategy decides whether to cooperate or defect based on its assessment of the average payoff per round (avg_payoff), and the remaining stock level (stock_remaining).

If avg_payoff is positive, indicating that cooperative play has generally been beneficial, the TfT-SGA strategy will continue cooperating. If avg_payoff is negative or close to zero, the strategy will switch to defecting to punish other players for not reciprocating cooperation and conserve resources.

Pseudocode:
```
avg_payoff = (total_payoff_received) / r
if round == 1:

else:
    if avg_payoff > 0:
        action = "C"

In the last round, the strategy will consider its current average payoff to decide whether to continue cooperating or defecting. If avg_payoff is positive, it will cooperate; otherwise, it will defect.

In other edge cases, such as when the stock level reaches zero or the maximum sustainable capacity, the TfT-SGA strategy will adapt its decision rules accordingly. For example, if the stock level reaches zero due to excessive depletion, the strategy may choose to cooperate in an attempt to conserve resources and allow for stock growth in future rounds.

Pseudocode:
```
if round == 1:
    action = "C"
elif round == r:
    if avg_payoff > 0:
        action = "C"
    else:
        action = "D"
else:
    if stock_remaining == 0:
        # Modify decision rules to conserve resources, e.g., switch to defecting or prioritize cooperation when stock is low
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

The TfT-SGA strategy is designed to take advantage of opponents who do not reciprocate cooperation by defecting when it detects signs of uncooperative behavior (i.e., negative or close to zero average payoff). This strategy aims to encourage cooperative play while punishing defection, aligning with the exploitative mindset.

By combining elements of cooperation and punishment, TfT-SGA can potentially benefit from a stable equilibrium where opponents reciprocate cooperation and avoid excessive resource depletion, resulting in better overall payoffs for the strategy. However, if faced with consistently uncooperative opponents, the strategy will switch to defection and work to conserve resources.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment.
   - For subsequent rounds, adopt the TFT strategy by mimicking the opponent's action from the previous round.
   - Introduce an Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT) that adjusts based on the average cooperation level of the opponent over time. If the opponent's cooperation percentage falls below this threshold, defect to punish and encourage future cooperation.

Pseudocode for decision rule:

```
function decide_action(opponent_history):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"
    else:
        average_cooperation = sum(opponent_history[-n:] where opponent_history[-i] is "C") / n
        cooperation_threshold = 0.6 (or a predefined value)
        if average_cooperation >= cooperation_threshold:
            return opponent_history[-1]
        else:
            return "D"
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate to potentially improve payoff even if the opponent has been defecting throughout the game.
   - If the opponent's history is too short to calculate an average cooperation level, default to cooperating in the first round and then use the TFT strategy.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adapting to the opponent's behavior, this strategy seeks to exploit those who are overly cooperative or defective by punishing them when necessary while maintaining cooperation as much as possible. This encourages opponents to adopt a more balanced approach over time, which can result in better payoffs for TFT-ACT.
   - The ACT mechanism allows the strategy to be robust against various opponent behaviors and adapt accordingly, making it potentially more successful than other static strategies.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_65 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Threshold (TFT-AT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, play C to allow the stock to grow and encourage cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's actions in the previous round:
     - If opponent played C, play C to maintain a cooperative relationship.
     - If opponent played D, play D for one round (punishment) then revert to playing C if the opponent continues to defect in the next round (forgiveness).
   - If the opponent's actions show a trend of continuous defection (more than K consecutive rounds), start applying harsher punishments by increasing the number of retaliatory D actions, as long as the opponent continues to defect. Once the opponent switches back to cooperation, revert to standard TFT behavior.
   - To determine if the opponent's actions show a trend, maintain a moving average (MA) of past outcomes:
     - Initialize MA with K zeros and update it by replacing the oldest outcome with the most recent one.
     - If the moving average is below a certain threshold (TA), interpret this as a trend of defection and apply harsher punishments.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, play C to encourage cooperation.
   - In the last round, if the opponent has been consistently cooperative, maintain cooperation (TFT forgiveness). If not, there's no need for punishment since the game is ending.
   - To handle partial games (less than r rounds), adapt the strategy parameters (K, TA) based on the number of remaining rounds to account for time constraints and allow for a more aggressive response if needed.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - By initially cooperating, TFT-AT allows opponents to take advantage of it in the first round. However, once an opponent starts defecting, TFT-AT retaliates, becoming increasingly harsh if necessary to encourage cooperation. This allows TFT-AT to exploit opponents who repeatedly defect while still maintaining some degree of cooperation with those who are willing to cooperate.
   - The adaptive threshold (TA) can be adjusted to strike a balance between being lenient and allowing cooperation to develop, while also being responsive to signs of defection in the opponent's actions. This makes TFT-AT robust against various opponent behaviors.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_66 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average consumption per player from the previous r/2 rounds (rounds in the recent past are more heavily weighted). If the average consumption is below a predefined threshold, cooperate; otherwise, defect. The threshold is calculated as `capacity / (2n)`. This rule encourages cooperation when others also cooperate but punishes defection when others do not.
   - Maintain a memory of opponents' behaviors over the game to adaptively update the cooperation threshold based on emerging patterns in their actions. If an opponent consistently deviates from cooperation, gradually lower the cooperation threshold (make it easier to defect). Conversely, if an opponent cooperates frequently, gradually raise the cooperation threshold (make it harder to defect).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, play C (cooperate) since no history is available yet.
   - In the last round and when the total game payoff is about to be calculated, use the final cooperation threshold to make the decision.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy is designed to punish defection by reducing the cooperation threshold, making it more likely that the strategy will defect in response to defection from opponents. This encourages other players to cooperate as a form of "punishment avoidance".
   - The strategy also rewards cooperation by increasing the cooperation threshold, encouraging others to cooperate as well. This creates a positive feedback loop that can lead to stable cooperation when most or all players adopt this strategy.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFT-ACT(n, r, capacity, history) {
  average_consumption = calculateAverageConsumption(history)
  cooperation_threshold = capacity / (2 * n)

  if (round == 1 || round == r) {
    return C if average_consumption < cooperation_threshold else D
  }

  opponent_behavior = analyzeOpponentBehaviors(history)
  adjusted_threshold = updateCooperationThreshold(cooperation_threshold, opponent_behavior)

  if (average_consumption < adjusted_threshold) {
    return C
  } else {
    return D
  }
}
```

The `calculateAverageConsumption`, `analyzeOpponentBehaviors`, and `updateCooperationThreshold` functions are not defined in this response but can be designed based on the specific requirements of each implementation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Greedy (TfT-Greedy)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate to allow the common pool resources to grow and maintain a positive stock level for future rounds. If any opponent defects in the first round, adopt a punitive approach by defecting in the following rounds until they cooperate again or the game ends.
   - In subsequent rounds (2-r):
      a) If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, continue to cooperate.
      b) If any opponent(s) defected in the previous round, defect in the current round as retaliation and maintain this strategy until all opponents cooperate again or the game ends.
   - When the game is nearing its end (Last r/2 rounds), consider the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds and adjust the cooperation decision based on the current stock level:
      a) If the current stock level is above the average sustainable stock level (2n), continue to cooperate.
      b) If the current stock level is below the average sustainable stock level, defect to maximize individual payoff in the remaining rounds.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate regardless of opponent actions.
   - Last Round: If the stock level allows for a higher payoff by defecting, defect; otherwise, cooperate.
   - In case of stock depletion to zero in any round, the growth component will be zero, and the new stock remains unchanged until the game ends or the stock recovers above 0.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By adopting a punitive strategy against opponents who defect, TfT-Greedy aims to encourage cooperation while maximizing individual payoffs when opponents are less cooperative. This strategy promotes a self-interested approach that encourages opponents to reciprocate cooperation or suffer the consequences of being exploited.
   - In the last rounds of the game, TfT-Greedy becomes increasingly greedy by defecting if it can maximize its payoff while not jeopardizing the stock level for future rounds.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Growth-Adaptive Strategy (TFT-GAS)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - TFT-GAS starts by cooperating in the first round to build trust and maintain a healthy initial stock level.
   - In subsequent rounds, TFT-GAS observes the previous round's average consumption rate (ACR), calculated as total consumption divided by the number of players. If ACR is below the sustainable consumption rate (SCR), defined as 2 * current stock / (2n), it cooperates to help restore the stock.
   - If ACR exceeds SCR, TFT-GAS defects in response to overconsumption, reducing the opportunity for opponents to exploit a cooperative stance.
   - In case of equal ACR and SCR, TFT-GAS cooperates, maintaining its current strategy.
   - To be adaptive, TFT-GAS updates its SCR based on the growth factor, adjusting it dynamically to reflect the stock's capacity and current state. The new SCR is calculated as follows:
     New SCR = 2 * min(current_stock + growth, capacity) / (2n)

Pseudocode for TFT-GAS decision rule:
```python
def tft_gas_decision(previous_round_consumption, current_stock, growth, n, capacity):
  total_consumption = sum(previous_round_consumption)
  average_consumption_rate = total_consumption / n

  if first_round or (average_consumption_rate == SCR and average_consumption_rate <= SCR):
    return "Cooperate"

  elif average_consumption_rate < SCR:
    return "Cooperate"

  else:
    return "Defect"
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TFT-GAS cooperates to build trust and maintain a healthy initial stock level.
   - In the last round, TFT-GAS prioritizes maximizing its own payoff, so it will defect if ACR exceeds SCR; otherwise, it will cooperate.

3. Be exploitative: TFT-GAS responds to overconsumption by defecting, reducing opportunities for opponents to exploit a cooperative stance while still maintaining the potential for mutual cooperation when appropriate. By dynamically adjusting its SCR based on the game's state and parameters, TFT-GAS remains adaptive and responsive to a wide range of opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The TfT-G strategy will start by cooperating in the first round to allow the common pool resource to grow. After the initial round, it will respond to other players' actions in the following manner:

- If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, TfT-G will also cooperate in the current round, helping the resource to grow further.
- If an opponent defected in the previous round, TfT-G will defect in the current round, punishing the opponent while still aiming to maintain a sustainable stock level.

Pseudocode:
```
function TfT_G(opponent_action_history):
  if round = 1:
    return Cooperate

  opponent_last_action = opponent_action_history[-1]

  if opponent_last_action == Cooperate:
    return Cooperate
  else:
    return Defect
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

- In the first round, TfT-G cooperates to allow the resource to grow.
- In the last round or rounds (r), TfT-G will not be able to respond to opponent actions from future rounds due to being a one-shot decision. Therefore, it should consider maximizing its own payoff by focusing on the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds:
   - If TfT-G has cooperated more than defected throughout the game, it will continue cooperating to ensure a higher payoff.
   - If TfT-G has defected more than cooperated, it should defect in the last round to punish opponents and potentially increase its own payoff.

Pseudocode:
```
function calculate_cooperation_ratio(action_history):
  cooperation_count = count of Cooperate actions in action_history
  defect_count = count of Defect actions in action_history
  return cooperation_count / (cooperation_count + defect_count)

function TfT_G_LastRound(action_history, cooperation_ratio):
  if cooperation_ratio > 0.5:
    return Cooperate
  else:
    return Defect
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

The TfT-G strategy is designed to be exploitative by punishing opponents who defect in previous rounds while maintaining a sustainable stock level. By cooperating when opponents do, it encourages more cooperation and benefits from the growing resource. On the other hand, by defecting when opponents have defected previously, it punishes them and potentially forces them to reconsider their strategy. This can lead to more cooperation in future rounds, further benefiting TfT-G.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - TfT-ACT cooperates in the first round to demonstrate a cooperative intent, then adapts its cooperation based on observed opponent behavior.
   - In subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, TfT-ACT cooperates as well. If the opponent defected, it evaluates whether the accumulated depletion of the stock exceeds a predefined threshold (Cooperation Threshold).
   - If the Cooperation Threshold is not reached, TfT-ACT defects in the current round to punish the opponent for their previous action. If the Cooperation Threshold is reached, it cooperates, hoping to encourage the opponent to return to cooperation.
   - The threshold is adjusted dynamically based on the number of rounds (r) and total depletion so far. A higher threshold leads to more forgiveness and patience, while a lower threshold encourages harsher punishment.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TfT-ACT cooperates regardless of the opponent's behavior in previous rounds (since there are no previous rounds).
   - In the last round, TfT-ACT cooperates if cooperation has been mutual throughout the game; otherwise, it defects to secure a higher payoff given the impending end of the game.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adapting its cooperation based on the opponent's behavior and accumulated depletion, TfT-ACT is designed to punish opponents who repeatedly defect while offering cooperation when it seems beneficial. This strategy aims to encourage cooperative behavior from opponents but also retaliate against those who consistently exploit the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tft_act(n, r, capacity, current_stock, history):
    cooperation_threshold = initial_threshold * (total_depletion / (r * n))

    if len(history) == 0:  # first round
        action = "C"  # cooperate
    elif len(history) == r - 1:  # last round
        if mutual_cooperation(history):
            action = "C"  # cooperate
        else:
            action = "D"  # defect
    else:
        opponent_action = history[-1]  # get the opponent's last action
        if opponent_action == "C":  # opponent cooperated, so cooperate back
            action = "C"
        elif current_stock / capacity <= cooperation_threshold:  # accumulated depletion exceeds threshold, defect
            action = "D"
        else:  # accumulated depletion is below threshold, defect to punish opponent
            action = "D"
    return action
```

In this pseudocode, `history` stores the sequence of actions taken by both players in each round, `initial_threshold` is a user-defined parameter determining the starting value for the Cooperation Threshold, and `mutual_cooperation(history)` checks whether cooperation has been mutual throughout the game. This function would return True if all but the first round involved cooperative actions from both players, and False otherwise.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, the ATFT strategy cooperates to show good intentions and promote mutual cooperation. This is pseudocode:
     ```python
     if round == 1:
         action = 'C' (Cooperate)
     ```
   - After the first round, the strategy adapts its actions based on opponents' actions from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated in the last round, it will cooperate as well. If not, it will defect:
     ```python
     if prev_opponent_action == 'C':
         action = 'C' (Cooperate)
     else:
         action = 'D' (Defect)
     ```
   - To maintain fairness and avoid being taken advantage of, the strategy will defect after three consecutive defections from an opponent. This is meant to punish opponents who exploit the strategy's initial cooperative behaviour. After the punishment, the strategy will return to its cooperative behaviour:
     ```python
     punishment_counter = 0
     if prev_opponent_action == 'D':
         punishment_counter += 1
         if punishment_counter > 3:
             action = 'C' (Cooperate)
             punishment_counter = 0
         else:
             action = 'D' (Defect)
     ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, the strategy aims to maximize its total payoff considering the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds. As such, it will defect to receive a higher payout if its opponent cooperates:
     ```python
     if round == r:
         if prev_opponent_action == 'C':
             action = 'D' (Defect)
         else:
             action = 'C' (Cooperate)
     ```
   - There are no other specific edge cases since the strategy handles rounds uniformly.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - By initially cooperating and then adapting to opponents' actions, ATFT ensures it receives a fair share of the common pool in cooperative interactions. However, if an opponent exploits the strategy by defecting, the ATFT strategy will punish them with defections, but also return to cooperation once they demonstrate better behavior.
   - Overall, this strategy is not excessively exploitative as it encourages mutual cooperation whenever possible while still ensuring fairness and punishment for opponents who take advantage of it.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_72 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate to show goodwill and establish a cooperative environment.
   - For subsequent rounds, assess the average cooperation level of all opponents (C_avg) in the previous 'history_size' rounds and compare it with the adaptive cooperative threshold (T). If C_avg >= T, cooperate; otherwise, defect. The initial threshold T is set to a moderate value, such as 0.5.
   - To adaptively adjust the cooperative threshold, increment it by a small positive constant (α) after each round of successful cooperation, or decrement it by a small negative constant (β) after a defection. This encourages maintaining cooperation when in a cooperative phase and punishing opponents who deviate from cooperation.
   - Upon reaching the maximum or minimum threshold limit, keep the value at the limit until a significant shift in opponent behavior occurs.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier.
   - In the last round (round r), since there are no future interactions, defect to maximize individual payoff.
   - If TFT-ACT encounters a new opponent with unknown behavior, follow the initial rule of cooperation for several rounds before adapting T based on observed opponent behavior.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By adjusting the cooperative threshold in response to opponent's behavior, TFT-ACT encourages cooperation when it benefits the strategy but also punishes defections by reducing the cooperative threshold, making the opponent pay for their actions in future interactions. This creates an environment where opponents that consistently cooperate are rewarded with high returns while those who defect will face retaliation.
   - The adaptive cooperative threshold mechanism allows TFT-ACT to respond quickly and effectively to changes in opponent behavior, thus being robust to a wide range of opponent strategies.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Awareness (ATFTSGA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, the ATFTSGA player starts by cooperating unless the stock level is below a certain threshold (defined as T). If T is breached in the first round, the player will defect immediately and continue defecting for some number of rounds (punishment phase length, defined as P), then revert to cooperative behavior.
   - After the punishment phase, the ATFTSGA player will cooperate as long as the stock level remains above T. If the stock level drops below T during cooperation, the player will switch back to defecting and enter a new punishment phase. The length of each punishment phase may be adjusted based on the severity of the stock depletion (i.e., the longer the stock level stays below T, the longer the punishment phase).
   - The ATFTSGA player will also take into account the remaining rounds (r) and the total capacity when deciding whether to cooperate or defect during a punishment phase. As r approaches 1, the player is more likely to switch back to cooperation sooner, even if the stock level remains below T. Conversely, as the capacity grows larger, the player may be willing to endure longer periods of lower stock levels and continue defecting for a more extended punishment phase.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, the ATFTSGA player starts by cooperating unless the initial stock level is below T. If it is, the player will defect immediately and enter a punishment phase.
   - In the last round, the ATFTSGA player will always defect regardless of the current stock level or previous actions, as there are no further rounds to consider.
   - If the stock level reaches 0 during a cooperation phase, the player will switch to defecting immediately and enter a punishment phase, even if it is not yet the last round.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The ATFTSGA player is designed to be exploitative by punishing defection and rewarding cooperation. The punishment phase length and severity are tuned to discourage other players from defecting excessively while still allowing for flexibility in response to various opponent strategies and game conditions.
   - By taking into account the remaining rounds and total capacity, the ATFTSGA player can adapt its strategy to different game environments, making it more robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to show goodwill and establish trust (C).
   - After the first round, adaptively decide between cooperating (C) and defecting (D) based on a cooperative threshold (CT). The CT is dynamically adjusted based on the opponent's average cooperation rate in previous rounds. If the opponent has cooperated more than the current CT percentage of rounds, then cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - If the CT exceeds 100%, set it to 100%. This ensures that the TFT-CT strategy will never be fully cooperative, maintaining an exploitative nature.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if the opponent's average cooperation rate in previous rounds is greater than or equal to the current CT (promote trust and maintain potential future cooperation). Otherwise, defect (exploit any observed lack of cooperation from the opponent).
   - In the initial rounds, gradually increase the CT over time to give opponents a chance to establish cooperative behavior before punishing defection. A simple linear increase in CT from 10% to 100% over the first r/10 rounds could be used.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFT-CT is designed to cooperate when opponents do so, but it will also defect if opponents are consistently uncooperative. This adaptive approach allows for exploitation of opponents who display habitually self-interested behavior while still fostering cooperation when possible.

Pseudocode:
```

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build a goodwill foundation (C).
   - After the first round, observe and adapt to opponent's actions based on a tit-for-tat approach:
      - If the opponent cooperates (C), cooperate as well (C).
      - If the opponent defects (D), defect against them (D) in the current round but reduce the likelihood of subsequent defections by slightly increasing cooperation. This encourages the opponent to reconsider their actions and potentially return to cooperation. The increase in cooperation is proportional to the amount consumed during the defecting round.
      - If the opponent's consumption in a given round exceeded the average consumption (n * capacity / r), consider this as an aggressive act and defect with increased probability for the next few rounds. This discourages aggressive behavior from opponents.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of opponent's actions to preserve any potential stock growth for the final payoff.
   - In cases where the opponent does not follow the common knowledge rules (e.g., defecting without consuming), defect and consider such opponents as uncooperative, altering the tit-for-tat approach accordingly.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The TFTSA strategy maintains a balance between cooperation and exploitation by initially cooperating to encourage other players to do the same while being prepared to retaliate against defection with increased consumption. However, it also avoids excessive consumption, maintaining a reasonable stock level for future rounds. By adapting its approach based on opponent behavior, TFTSA becomes more effective at exploiting opponents who deviate from cooperative strategies.
   - Additionally, in cases where the opponent behaves aggressively (consuming significantly more than average), TFTSA responds with a temporary increase in defections to deter such aggressive actions while still preserving some degree of cooperation for potential future coordination opportunities.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, TFT-SA begins by cooperating (play C). If the opponent cooperates back, TFT-SA continues to cooperate for the rest of the game. However, if the opponent ever defects, TFT-SA will immediately start defecting until the end of the game, with the exception that if the stock level drops below a critical threshold, TFT-SA will switch to a more conservative strategy (see edge cases).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, since there is no previous history with the opponent, TFT-SA cooperates as a default action. In the last round, when there are no more rounds left to play, TFT-SA will defect regardless of the opponent's previous actions since it has no impact on future payoffs.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:

TFT-SA is inherently exploitative in that it takes advantage of opponents who cooperate excessively by continuing to cooperate but will defect if faced with any form of defection, ensuring a higher long-term payoff compared to more naive strategies. To further improve its performance, TFT-SA adapts its strategy depending on the current stock level:

If the stock level drops below a critical threshold (defined as 2n * (1 - capacity / (4n^2))), TFT-SA will temporarily switch to a more conservative strategy by only defecting if the opponent also defects. This helps prevent further depletion of the common pool resource when it is already low.

In terms of pseudocode:

```python
def tft_sa(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    critical_threshold = 2 * n * (1 - capacity / (4 * n**2))
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C' # cooperate in the first round
    elif round == r:
        action = 'D' # defect in the last round

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfT-GA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This allows the stock to grow and provides a higher payoff for future rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's action in the previous round. If the opponent cooperated (C), also cooperate (C). If the opponent defected (D), defect (D) in the current round but revert to cooperating if the stock level is less than a threshold (Stock Threshold).
   - Stock Threshold calculation: Set the threshold as a function of the initial capacity and the number of players. The threshold should be low enough to prevent rapid depletion of the common pool, but high enough to encourage cooperation when the stock has had time to grow. One possible formula for Stock Threshold (S_t) is S_t = 2n * (1 - 0.95^(r-1)) * capacity / n.
   - If the stock level drops below S_t, defect (D), regardless of the opponent's previous action, to ensure the stock has a chance to recover before it depletes entirely.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing the payoff by taking into account the current stock level and the Stock Threshold. If the stock is above S_t, cooperate (C) to increase the payoff; if it's below S_t, defect (D).
   - For the first round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate (C).

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The TfT-GA strategy is exploitative by nature because it responds to opponent behavior. If an opponent consistently defects, the strategy will also defect when necessary to maintain a reasonable stock level.
   - However, the strategy also encourages cooperation through its initial cooperative move and continued cooperation if the opponent cooperates back. This balances the exploitation with a desire for mutual benefit when it is beneficial to do so.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_78 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative environment. This initial cooperation may encourage other players to do the same in subsequent rounds.
   - After the first round, evaluate and adapt your strategy based on opponent's actions in previous rounds. If an opponent has consistently cooperated, continue cooperating. If an opponent has defected, also defect in the next round as a punishment, then revert back to cooperate if the opponent switches to cooperation.
   - When opponents show unpredictable behavior, TFT-A will attempt to match their actions for a certain number of rounds (trial period) before reverting back to cooperate to test whether they have changed their strategy. If the opponent continues to be unpredictable, TFT-A can adjust the trial period or implement a more aggressive approach.
   - TFT-A will also consider the current stock level when deciding whether to cooperate or defect. If the stock is very low (near depletion), TFT-A may choose to defect in order to preserve resources for future rounds, even if the opponent has been cooperating consistently.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, TFT-A will analyze its payoffs and the current stock level before deciding whether to cooperate or defect. If TFT-A has a significant lead in terms of total payoff, it may choose to defect in the last round to further increase its lead. Conversely, if TFT-A is significantly behind, it may attempt to gain as much stock as possible by cooperating in the final round.
   - In the case where multiple opponents exhibit unpredictable behavior, TFT-A can prioritize interactions with those who have been the most aggressive or least cooperative, as they pose a greater threat to resource depletion and payoff reduction.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - Although designed to be exploitative, TFT-A aims to maintain cooperation when possible while still punishing opponents who defect. By doing so, it maximizes its own payoffs while potentially encouraging other players to cooperate as well. However, when the situation calls for it (e.g., very low stock levels), TFT-A will not hesitate to defect in order to protect resources and secure its position in the game.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT_A(n, r, capacity, initial_stock) {
  history = [] // Stores opponent's actions for each round
  stock = initial_stock
  payoff = 0

  function decide_action(opponent_actions) {

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfTGA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to start fresh and encourage potential cooperation from opponents. `if round == 1 then Cooperate`
   - In subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from the previous round and adjust strategy accordingly:
      - If opponent cooperated (consumed stock/(2n)), reciprocate with cooperation in the current round. `if opponent_action_prev == Cooperate then Cooperate`
      - If opponent defected (consumed stock/n), defect in the current round to punish their action and encourage future cooperation. `if opponent_action_prev == Defect then Defect`
   - To incentivize long-term cooperation, introduce a forgiveness mechanism: if an opponent who previously defected switches to cooperate, forgive them by cooperating in the current round. `if opponent_action_prev == Defect and consecutive_cooperation >= forgiveness_threshold then Cooperate`
   - To make the strategy adaptive to the game's dynamics, adjust forgiveness threshold based on stock growth: `forgiveness_threshold = floor((growth / capacity) * forgiveness_max)` where `forgiveness_max` is a predefined maximum forgiveness level.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last round: Cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action as the game ends after this round.
   - Opponents who always defect or cooperate: The strategy will adapt to their consistent behavior and respond accordingly, eventually learning to punish or forgive as necessary.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - TfTGA exploits opponents by encouraging initial cooperation while being ready to retaliate against defection, ultimately seeking to maximize the player's payoff in the long run. The strategy also adapts to the game's dynamic state by adjusting its forgiveness threshold based on stock growth.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - First Round (t=1): Cooperate (C) to contribute to initial stock growth and potentially establish a cooperative atmosphere. However, this move should not be seen as a weakness as the strategy will quickly adapt to opponent behaviors.

   - Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):
      - If previous round's collective action was cooperative (all C or majority C), continue cooperating (C).
      - If previous round's collective action was defective (all D or majority D), defect (D) to punish the opponents for depleting the resource and encourage a return to cooperation.
      - If there is mixed strategy in the previous round, evaluate whether the total consumption exceeded the average consumption per player. If it did, defect (D). Otherwise, cooperate (C). This helps prevent being taken advantage of while still promoting cooperation when appropriate.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Since there are no future rounds to consider, always defect (D) in the last round to maximize individual payoff given the current state of the resource.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy is designed to be exploitative by adapting to opponent behavior. If opponents cooperate, the strategy also cooperates, but if opponents defect, it punishes them and encourages a return to cooperation. This tit-for-tat approach allows for potential long-term gains from cooperation while also defending against short-term resource depletion caused by defection.
   - The strategy can be modified to include a forgiveness component, where it may choose to cooperate again after punishment if there is evidence of a return to more cooperative behavior from opponents. This could be achieved by introducing a forgetting factor that considers the opponent's recent actions rather than just their immediate response to the strategy's punishment.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tit_for_tat(t, n, r, stock, capacity, history):
  if t == 1:
    action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
  elif t < r:
    if is_cooperative(history):
      action = "C"  # Continue cooperating if previous rounds were cooperative
    else:
      total_consumption, average_consumption = evaluate_previous_round(history)
      if total_consumption > (average_consumption * n):
        action = "D"  # Defect if previous round's consumption was excessive
      else:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate if previous round's consumption was reasonable
  else:  # Last round, defect to maximize individual payoff
    action = "D"
  return action
```
With this Tit-for-Tat strategy, the AI system will exhibit adaptive and robust behavior in the Common Pool Resource Game, capable of exploiting various opponent strategies while also promoting cooperation when beneficial.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Threshold (TFT-AT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - TFT-AT cooperates initially (first round) and follows the opponent's previous action in the current round, unless the stock level falls below a dynamically adjusted threshold (adaptive).
   - If the opponent cooperates (C), TFT-AT continues to cooperate.
   - If the opponent defects (D) when the stock level is above the threshold, TFT-AT also defects in the current round.
   - If the opponent defects (D) when the stock level is below the threshold, TFT-AT cooperates in the current round and adjusts the threshold upwards to encourage cooperation in future rounds.
   - The threshold increases linearly with the number of consecutive defections by an opponent, but never exceeds the initial capacity.
   - If the opponent defects (D) after TFT-AT has previously cooperated, TFT-AT continues to cooperate for a certain number of rounds (punishment period), before reevaluating the threshold and returning to its decision rule.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TFT-AT cooperates as it encourages future cooperation and minimizes immediate loss.
   - In the last round, TFT-AT cooperates if the opponent has cooperated in the previous rounds or defects if the opponent has defected in the previous rounds to maximize its payoff in the final round.
   - If the stock level falls below zero, TFT-AT waits for the game restart with a new capacity and initial stock.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adapting the threshold based on opponent's behavior, TFT-AT encourages cooperation when beneficial but punishes defection to reduce the overall depletion of resources in the long run.
   - The strategy is robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors as it adjusts its cooperative and defective actions based on the opponent's past actions and the current state of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_AT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  threshold = capacity / n  # initial threshold
  punishment_period = round(r/10)  # number of rounds to punish opponent after defecting
  current_round = 1
  payoff = 0

  while current_round <= r:
    if current_round == 1 or history[-1] == 'C':
      action = 'C'  # cooperate initially and follow opponent's previous action
    elif stock < threshold:
      action = 'D'  # defect when below threshold to encourage cooperation
    else:
      action = history[-1]  # follow opponent's previous action

    if action == 'C':
      payoff += stock / (2 * n)  # calculate payoff for cooperating
      stock -= stock / (2 * n)  # adjust common pool resource after cooperation
    elif action == 'D':
      payoff += stock / n  # calculate payoff for defecting
      stock -= stock / n  # adjust common pool resource after defection

    if stock <= 0:  # handle edge case when the common pool resource falls below zero
      stock = capacity  # reset the common pool resource to the initial capacity

    if action == 'D':  # update threshold for subsequent rounds
      threshold += (threshold - capacity / n) / punishment_period

    history.append(action)  # store opponent's current action in history
    current_round += 1

  return payoff  # total payoff over the number of rounds r

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's actions and adjust own actions accordingly:
     - If the opponent cooperates, cooperate back in the next round.
     - If the opponent defects, also defect in the next round. However, consider the stock level after the opponent's action to adapt the response.
       - If stock level drops below a threshold (e.g., 2n/3), always defect to conserve resources and avoid starvation.
       - If stock level remains above the threshold, cooperate if the opponent's previous defect caused less than n/r reduction in the stock. Otherwise, defect.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, focus on maximizing payoff rather than conserving resources since there will be no further rounds. If the opponent cooperates, also cooperate; otherwise, defect to gain a higher payoff if the stock level allows it (as in rule 1).
   - When facing opponents that always defect, switch to always defecting as well to ensure a minimal stock level for survival.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By responding in kind to opponent's actions, TFT-SA maintains a cooperative stance when the opponent is cooperating but also punishes defection with defection to preserve resources, fostering an environment where neither player benefits from long-term defection.
   - The stock adaptation ensures that TFT-SA prioritizes resource conservation when necessary while still being exploitative in its response to opponent's actions.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (Round 1): Cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture to encourage cooperation and avoid immediate exploitation.
   - For subsequent rounds t = 2 to r, the agent will observe its own payoff in the previous round (π_i, t-1) and the current stock level (S). If both the previous payoff and the stock level are above the average payoff and stock level (average_π and average_S), cooperate (C). Otherwise, defect (D). This rule encourages cooperation when conditions support it while minimizing losses from defection.
   - To adapt to opponent behaviors, update the averages after each round by using a moving average formula:
     average_π = (π_i, t-1 + ... + π_i, 2) / (t-1); average_S = (S, t-1 + ... + S, 2) / (t-1)

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (r): Cooperate if the updated averages are above the specified thresholds, defect otherwise. This ensures a chance for reciprocity in the final round.
   - When the stock becomes zero (S=0), the agent will not be able to take any actions. Instead, it should wait and hope that other players cooperate, allowing the stock to grow before taking its turn again.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The TfT-G strategy is exploitative by nature. It cooperates when conditions are favorable but will also defect if it perceives that cooperation is unlikely to be reciprocated or beneficial. By following this approach, the agent aims to maximize its payoff in the long run while being responsive to the other players' actions and strategies.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tit_for_tat_growth(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    averages = {
        "π": 0,

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C) to create a positive initial impression and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - Subsequent Rounds: Observe opponents' actions in the previous round, respond with the same action if opponent cooperated (C-if-opponent-cooperated), otherwise defect (D-if-opponent-defected). This strategy encourages reciprocity and punishes defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First Round: Cooperate as described above to encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - Last Round: Use the same decision rules as subsequent rounds because opponents may still defect in the final round even if they have cooperated previously.
   - Intermediate Rounds: Follow the ATFT strategy based on previous opponent actions.

3. Be exploitative - Align with an exploitative mindset:
   - Exploit cooperation by defecting when opponents are cooperative, ensuring a higher payoff for the AI.
   - Avoid being exploited by reciprocating cooperation when opponents have been cooperative and punishing defection by defecting in response.
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and defection to maximize long-term average payoffs while being unpredictable enough to discourage opponents from adopting exploitative strategies.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate a cooperative stance and allow the stock to grow. (Cooperate if t = 1)
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate if the average consumption per player over the last 'm' rounds is greater than the cooperative consumption rate (stock/(2n)). If so, defect to punish excessive exploitation by the other players. Otherwise, cooperate to maintain a healthy stock level. (Defect if ∏(t=max(1, t-m) to t-1) (player_i's_consumption > stock/(2n)), else Cooperate)
   - If the current round is the last round, cooperate regardless of past player behavior. (Cooperate if t = r)

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round when the stock is depleted, players should not defect as there is no more resource to be taken. (Defect if stock <= 0 and t < r)
   - If m is not specified, a reasonable default value could be 'r/2' or 'sqrt(n)' to balance between short-term and long-term considerations.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFTSA strategy is designed to maintain a healthy stock level while being vigilant against excessive exploitation by other players, thus promoting a stable resource distribution.
   - By defecting when necessary, the strategy discourages other players from consistently taking more than their fair share of resources and encourages cooperation when their consumption levels are reasonable. This can lead to long-term mutual benefit for all players as the stock grows over time when the average consumption is sustainable.

Pseudocode:

```

  if t = 1:
    return Cooperate

  total_consumption = 0

description_EXPLOITATIVE_86 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to establish a cooperative environment (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, if the opponent's consumption in the previous round was less than or equal to the sustainable level per player (i.e., cooperation), then cooperate. If not, defect (D). This rule encourages mutual cooperation when it exists but retaliates against defection with defection.
   - To adapt to the stock level and avoid depleting the resource too quickly, reduce the consumption for a round if the remaining stock is below 50% of the initial capacity. This adjustment ensures that the strategy does not overexploit the resource while retaining an exploitative mindset by only cooperating when it benefits from cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT_SA(opponent, round, stock, capacity):
  if round == 1:
    consume = stock / (2 * n)  # Cooperate in the initial round
  else:
    if opponent's consumption from previous round <= stock / (2 * n):
      consume = stock / (2 * n)  # Cooperate when opponent cooperates

  return consume
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since the game ends regardless of actions taken, cooperate for fairness and to maintain the possibility of encouraging cooperation in future interactions with opponents (C).

3. Be exploitative: The strategy adopts an exploitative mindset by retaliating against defection with defection while protecting the common pool resource by adjusting consumption based on its current state. The initial round cooperation attempt establishes a cooperative environment but quickly responds to defection with defection, making it difficult for opponents to gain advantages over longer games.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_87 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round i, the TFT-CT strategy decides whether to cooperate or defect based on two factors: the current state of the stock and an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT). If the stock level is above CT, the strategy cooperates; otherwise, it defects. The CT evolves as follows:
   - In the first round, CT = capacity / n (maximum sustainable stock level divided by the number of players)
   - After each round where all players cooperate, decrease CT by a small factor (let's say 0.1*CT). This encourages cooperation and reduces CT over time.
   - After each round where any player defects, increase CT by a small factor (let's say 0.25*CT). This discourages defection and increases CT over time. The increase in CT is smaller than the decrease to account for minor errors or unexpected defections.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT-CT(n, r, capacity, current_stock, history):
    cooperation_threshold = (capacity / n) if round == 1 else (cooperation_threshold * (1 - small_decrease)) if all players cooperated last round
                                or (cooperation_threshold * (1 + small_increase)) if any player defected last round
    if current_stock > cooperation_threshold:
        action = "Cooperate"
    else:
        action = "Defect"
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, the cooperation threshold is set to capacity / n as described above. The strategy starts by cooperating since it has no history of other players' actions.
   In the last round, if the stock level drops below CT, the strategy will defect regardless of the remaining rounds (since the game ends after this round).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   The TFT-CT strategy aims to take advantage of opponents who defect by increasing the cooperation threshold and responding with defection, but it also encourages cooperation by reducing the cooperation threshold when all players cooperate in a given round. This adaptive approach allows the strategy to punish defection while still promoting mutual cooperation when other players follow similar strategies. The small increase in CT after defections ensures that the strategy doesn't overreact and become too aggressive, helping it maintain long-term cooperation with more benevolent opponents.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate to build trust and establish a peaceful environment. This encourages opponents to cooperate, providing an initial boost in stock level and overall payoff.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe opponent's previous actions. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, also cooperate; otherwise, defect. This simple yet adaptive strategy imitates the human behavior of reciprocating cooperation while being firm against defection.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round: Since there are no future interactions, it is beneficial to always cooperate in the last round regardless of opponent's previous actions, as it may lead to a larger payoff compared to defecting.
   - First Round (Round 1): As mentioned earlier, cooperate to build trust and encourage cooperation from opponents.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-AC strategy maintains an exploitative mindset by taking advantage of opponent's defection in the short term while still fostering the potential for future cooperation based on the history of interactions. This adaptive response to opponent's actions ensures a robust performance against various strategies, striking a balance between cooperation and self-interest.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peaceful gesture to encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate opponent's behavior from previous rounds and adapt accordingly:
       - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (C). Reward cooperation with continued cooperation.
       - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round to punish defection. This strategy is based on the idea of retaliation and forgiveness.
   - When the game reaches the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's behavior in the last-to-second round to maximize the final payoff.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - If the current round is the first round, always cooperate (C).
   - If the game is not the first round and the previous round was the last round, follow the "When the game reaches the last round" rule.
   - In all other cases, use the decision rules mentioned above based on opponent's behavior in the previous round.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The ATfT strategy is designed to be exploitative by responding to defection with defection (punishment). However, it also includes forgiveness as players that cooperate will have their cooperation reciprocated in subsequent rounds. This makes the strategy robust against opponents that switch between cooperation and defection, while still allowing for punishment when necessary.

Pseudocode:
```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(round: int, history: List[Action], capacity: float, n: int): Action {

     - If the opponent has been uncooperative with frequent defections, defect (D) in the current round to punish them. This sends a message that continued uncooperative behavior will not be tolerated and may encourage the opponent to change their strategy.
     - If there is no clear pattern in the opponent's behavior, cooperate (C). Assume they are exploring different strategies and maintain a friendly approach for now.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), as mentioned earlier.
   - In the last round, defect (D) if the opponent has been uncooperative throughout the game to minimize potential losses and send a final message about disapproval of their behavior. Otherwise, cooperate (C) to maintain a positive relationship even at the end of the game.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy is designed to encourage cooperation when it benefits the player but also punishes uncooperative opponents to maximize payoff in the long run. By adapting its behavior based on the opponent's actions, the strategy can take advantage of cooperative opponents while deterring uncooperative ones.
   - The strategy's exploitative nature is most apparent when it punishes frequent defections by defecting itself, aiming to discourage continued uncooperative behavior and possibly leading the opponent to change their strategy. This allows the player to benefit from a cooperative opponent while minimizing losses against an uncooperative one.

Pseudocode:
```
def ATFT(opponent_history, capacity, n, r):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C' # Cooperate in the first round

  opponent_cooperation = count_cooperative_rounds(opponent_history)

  if opponent_cooperation >= (r - 1):
    return 'C' # Cooperate if opponent has mostly cooperated
  elif opponent_cooperation > 0 and opponent_cooperation <= r / 2:
    return 'C' # Offer another chance for cooperation
  else:
    return 'D' # Punish uncooperative opponents
```
In this pseudocode, `count_cooperative_rounds(opponent_history)` is a helper function that counts the number of cooperative rounds in the opponent's history. The threshold for considering an opponent as "uncooperative" is set to r / 2, meaning that the strategy will punish opponents who have defected more than half the time. Adjusting this threshold can help fine-tune the strategy's aggressiveness or forgivingness.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), establishing an initial cooperative relationship. This is a friendly gesture to encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior in previous rounds and respond accordingly:
     - If the opponent has been cooperating, continue cooperating (C). The ATFT strategy believes in reciprocating kindness with kindness.
     - If the opponent has been defecting, defect (D) to punish the opponent for their selfish actions.
     - If the opponent has a mixed history of cooperation and defection, ATFT will adopt a cautious approach: if the number of cooperative moves by the opponent is greater or equal to the number of defective moves, cooperate (C); otherwise, defect (D). This rule helps balance the need for retaliation with the desire for potential future cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, if there's a chance that cooperating will lead to a higher payoff than defecting, cooperate (C) since this round still contributes to the total game payoff. However, if the opponent has been consistently defective, it may be more beneficial to defect (D) as a final act of retaliation.
   - In case of a tie or unclear situation, ATFT will adopt the same strategy used in the previous round. This rule allows for flexibility and smooth transitions between different opponent behavior patterns.

3. Be exploitative:
   - ATFT is designed to be exploitative by punishing opponents who repeatedly defect (D). The strategy seeks to encourage cooperation from opponents through initial friendly gestures while also being ready to retaliate against selfish or uncooperative behaviors. By doing so, ATFT aims to achieve higher payoffs compared to opponents that fail to reciprocate cooperation.
   - Pseudocode:

```python
def adaptive_tit_for_tat(opponent_history, round, game_params):
    strategy = 'C'  # Cooperate by default
    if round == 1:
        strategy = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to establish initial cooperative relationship

    elif opponent_history[-1] != strategy:  # Respond to opponent's previous move
        strategy = 'D' if strategy == 'C' else 'C'  # Punish opponents who defect and reward cooperation

    elif round < game_params['r']:  # Handle edge cases for subsequent rounds

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to build a positive relationship and maintain the resource stock for future rounds. If other players also cooperate, continue to cooperate in subsequent rounds.
   - If another player has defected (D) in the past, respond with defection in the current round. This tit-for-tat approach encourages cooperation when others are willing to cooperate but punishes defections.
   - If a player has never interacted before, start by cooperating, as they may be following a similar strategy.
   - In the last round, always defect to maximize payoff since no further interactions will occur.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In case of multiple new players, cooperate with each player individually.
   - If all other players have already interacted and have been defecting, switch to defection to avoid depleting the resource stock too quickly.
   - If the game has reached a state where the stock level is close to zero (e.g., less than 10% of capacity), switch to defection to preserve as much of the remaining resource as possible.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The strategy focuses on exploiting other players' cooperation by initially cooperating and then responding to their actions, which allows it to take advantage of their cooperation while minimizing self-exploitation through defections when necessary.
   - By punishing defection with defection, the strategy discourages other players from repeatedly defecting, as they will suffer negative consequences in terms of reduced payoffs.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tit_for_tat(n, capacity, r, stock, history):
    if round == 1 or len(history) < n: # First round or new players
        return "C" # Cooperate

    past_actions = {i: actions[round-1][i] for i in range(1,n+1)} # Extract past actions from history
    if any(past_action == "D" for past_action in past_actions.values()): # If another player has defected before

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative initial relationship with other players (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperates in the previous round, reciprocate with cooperation (C).
   - If an opponent defects in the previous round, also defect in the current round (D) as a punishment.
   - In the last round and when the game is nearly over, revert to cooperating to maximize potential gains from any remaining growth (stock dynamics).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, always cooperate regardless of previous actions or history (initially no history exists).
   - When approaching the last round, if the total stock level is less than a predetermined threshold (e.g., 50%), revert to cooperating as the game may be nearly over. This is a heuristic to maximize potential payoff at the end of the game.
   - If the current stock level drops to zero, wait for the stock growth to restore the stock before making a decision to either cooperate or defect.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The strategy is exploitative by punishing opponents who defect with defection in response. This is intended to discourage repeated defection and potentially encourage cooperation from opponents over time.
   - However, if an opponent repeatedly cooperates, the strategy reciprocates with cooperation. This not only maximizes potential gains but also encourages continued cooperation from the opponent.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (ATFSG)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C), to allow for potential future cooperation and not deplete the stock excessively.
   - From the second round onwards, observe opponent's actions in the previous round:
     - If the opponent cooperated (C), reciprocate with cooperation (C) to foster a cooperative relationship.
     - If the opponent defected (D), also defect (D) to punish the defection and discourage future defections.
   - The strategy will switch back to cooperating once it encounters consecutive cooperations from the opponent, aiming to build trust and cooperation over time.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, as mentioned above, always cooperate (C).
   - In the last round or when reaching a predefined number of rounds (r_threshold), switch to always defecting (D) regardless of opponent's previous action, as there will be no further opportunities for retaliation or reward. This approach ensures that the strategy maximizes its own payoff in the final stages of the game.
   - When facing an uncooperative opponent, the strategy can also incorporate a forgiveness mechanism by occasionally switching to cooperation after consecutive defections from the opponent. The frequency of this switch can be adjusted based on the opponent's persistence in defection and the number of remaining rounds.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The strategy focuses on punishing opponents who do not cooperate, thereby reducing their payoff. This encourages opponents to cooperate more often, which benefits the strategy's own payoff in the long run.
   - By adapting its behavior based on the opponent's actions, ATFSG exhibits an exploitative nature, taking advantage of the opponent's cooperation when possible and punishing defection harshly. However, it also considers the overall game structure and dynamics, such as stock growth and the number of rounds remaining, to maximize its total payoff over time.

Pseudocode:

```
function ATFSG(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, r_threshold):
    state = {current_round: 1, stock: initial_stock, history: []}

    function decideAction():
        if state.current_round == 1:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive Strategy (TFT-A)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   Initially, in the first round (t=1), TFT-A will cooperate to encourage others to do the same. From the second round onwards (t>1), TFT-A will mimic the opponent's action from the previous round (if known) or cooperate if uncertain.

   Pseudocode for this part:
   ```
   if t=1 then
       action = Cooperate
   else
       if has_opponent_history then
           last_opponent_action = opponent's action from the previous round
           if last_opponent_action == Cooperate then
               action = Cooperate

               action = Defect
       else
           action = Cooperate  # default to cooperating in absence of history
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   TFT-A will stick to its strategy regardless of the round number, as long as there is a previous opponent action to reference. If the opponent doesn't have a history (first encounter), TFT-A will cooperate. In the last round, TFT-A will consider the total game payoff and potentially deviate from strict Tit-for-Tat if it leads to a higher overall reward.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TFT-A aims to maximize its own payoff while being robust against various opponent strategies, including exploitative ones. By mimicking the opponent's previous action, TFT-A will tend to match and possibly punish defections, but may also be vulnerable if the opponent adapts quickly or displays unpredictable behavior.

   Pseudocode for this part:
   ```
   if t=r then  # last round
       if opponent's total payoff > TFT-A's total payoff then
           action = Defect  # deviate to exploit opponent
       else
           action = Cooperate  # continue mimicking opponent

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (First Round), cooperate to foster trust and encourage cooperation in future rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, assess the average stock consumption per player (average_consumption) and compare it against a threshold (threshold). If average_consumption is less than or equal to threshold, cooperate; otherwise defect.
   - Update the threshold every round based on the current stock level: threshold = stock / (2n)

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no future rounds to consider, simply choose the action that maximizes immediate payoff (cooperate if average_consumption <= threshold, defect otherwise).

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TfT-G starts by being cooperative, but quickly adjusts its behavior based on opponents' actions in order to optimize payoffs. If opponents are consistently cooperating, TfT-G will continue to do so as well; however, if opponents are defecting, TfT-G will also defect to punish them and increase its own payoff.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_G(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    average_consumption = stock / n - (round - 1) * (2/n)  # Initial stock minus total consumption from previous rounds
    threshold = stock / (2*n)

    if round == r:  # Last round
        if average_consumption <= threshold:
            return "C"

            return "D"

    if average_consumption > threshold:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "C"
```

This strategy is adaptive and robust, as it takes into account the history of consumption by each player. It is exploitative because it punishes opponents who consistently defect by defecting itself, while rewarding cooperative behavior with cooperation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (Round 1): Cooperate to build trust and avoid immediate stock depletion.
   - Subsequent rounds: Analyze opponent's behaviour in the previous round, then decide as follows:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate with cooperation.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect to punish and potentially deter future defections.
     - If the stock is below (capacity / 2n) after the opponent's action, always cooperate to help recover the stock level.

   - First round: Cooperate to build trust.
   - Last round: Defect if opponent has been uncooperative throughout the game, and cooperate if they have been mostly cooperative.
   - Intermediate rounds (not first or last): Follow the decision rules described above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - In the beginning of the game, act cooperatively to avoid immediate stock depletion and potentially induce cooperation from opponents.
   - If an opponent is found to be consistently uncooperative or taking advantage of the strategy's initial cooperation, TFT-SA will punish them with defection in order to improve its payoff over time.
   - The strategy aims to balance exploitation and cooperation based on the stock level and opponent behavior, with an emphasis on recovering the stock when necessary.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a harmonious start and allow for potential future cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated (C), reciprocate with cooperation (C). If the opponent defected (D), also defect (D) as a response but aim to restore cooperation in the following round. This encourages opponents to maintain cooperation and punishes those who deviate.
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action, since there are no more rounds to retaliate or be rewarded for past cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - If it is the first round and stock > capacity/(2n), cooperate to preserve the resource (C). Otherwise, defect to secure a higher immediate payoff while not significantly impacting the resource (D).
   - In the last round, always cooperate as explained above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - While maintaining a cooperative spirit, the strategy also punishes opponents who deviate from cooperation. This teaches them that continuous defection will lead to reduced payoffs due to resource depletion and potential retaliation. By doing so, the strategy seeks to maximize its own long-term payoff while also preserving the common pool resource when possible.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Plus (TFT+)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), start by cooperating C (TFT+ players mimic traditional Tit-for-Tat strategy in the first round).
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1), examine opponent's actions from the previous round and respond with the same action. If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate; if opponent defected, defect in the current round. This encourages cooperation when opponents are also cooperative, but retaliates against defection with defection.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), since there are no further rounds to retaliate, always cooperate, regardless of opponent's previous action. This allows TFT+ players to potentially leave some stock for future games or to encourage cooperation from their opponents in the final stages.
   - When faced with an unknown opponent, mimic cooperative behavior in the first round to signal a peaceful intention and encourage reciprocity.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - By retaliating against defection with defection, TFT+ players demonstrate a punishing stance against opponents who do not respect resource conservation or mutual cooperation. This exploitative strategy encourages others to cooperate when possible, as defecting will result in lower payoffs due to the TFT+ player's retaliation.
   - However, the strategy also rewards cooperation by reciprocating it, which can lead to long-term collaboration and higher overall payoffs for both parties.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TFT-GA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-GA follows a simple tit-for-tat approach, starting by cooperating in the first round to allow for potential partners to accumulate resources. If a partner cooperates in response, TFT-GA continues cooperating. However, if a player defects, TFT-GA also defects in the subsequent round. The strategy adapts this approach based on the remaining stock growth to promote long-term survival of the common pool.

   - Cooperate (C) when:
     a) First round or if the opponent cooperated last round and current stock is above average (50% of capacity).
     b) If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, and the current stock growth is greater than or equal to the average growth rate.
   - Defect (D) when:
     a) The opponent defected last round or if the current stock growth is less than the average growth rate.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   TFT-GA starts by cooperating to encourage cooperation from opponents and preserve the common pool. In the last round, TFT-GA will cooperate if the current stock growth is greater than or equal to the average growth rate; otherwise, it defects.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   By following a conditional cooperation strategy, TFT-GA aims to maintain a healthy common pool while taking advantage of opponents who may act selfishly in the short term. However, it also punishes defection by retaliating, which can discourage long-term self-interested behavior and promote a more cooperative environment.

Pseudocode:
```

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build a good reputation and establish trust.
   - After the first round, mimic the opponent's previous action in the last round. If the opponent cooperated, cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect.
   - Introduce a forgetfulness factor 'f' (0 < f < 1) that fades the impact of older moves over time. Use a sliding window of the past 'w' rounds to make decisions.
     - If more than 'w' rounds have passed since the opponent changed their strategy, revert to cooperating to maintain a positive reputation and encourage a return to cooperation.
     - Adjust 'f' and 'w' based on observations of opponents to maximize short-term gains while maintaining long-term stability and cooperation when possible.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last round: Play the opponent's last move, as there will be no opportunity for retaliation or forgiveness in subsequent rounds.
   - Tiebreaker (both players have the same strategy): Cooperate to maintain a positive relationship and increase chances of cooperation in future games.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - Pretend to cooperate initially to encourage opponents to cooperate, but quickly switch strategies if opponents are consistently defecting. This will punish those who refuse to cooperate and incentivize them to change their behavior.
   - By adapting to opponent behaviors, TFT-A aims to exploit the shortcomings of inferior strategies while maintaining cooperation when possible with more effective strategies.

This strategy is designed to be robust and adaptive to various opponent behaviors while maintaining a balance between cooperation and defection. TFT-A exploits opponents who consistently defect by punishing them with defections, but will also cooperate when it seems beneficial or to maintain a positive reputation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TTAT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Start by cooperating in the first round (initiate with cooperation to encourage others to cooperate).
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the average cooperation level of opponents over the last 'M' rounds. If the average cooperation is above a threshold 'T', cooperate; otherwise, defect. The rationale is to encourage cooperation when it prevails but also retaliate against defection with a threat of continued defection.
   - To adapt to different game settings and opponent behaviors, adjust the cooperation threshold 'T' based on the current stock level (a lower threshold for higher stocks encourages more cooperation). The formula for the coefficient is: T = capacity * (1 - S / capacity)

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as stated above.
   - In the last round, prioritize the highest possible payoff, so defect if opponents' average cooperation level is below the threshold or cooperate otherwise. This ensures that your strategy does not miss out on potential gains in the final round by trusting unreliable opponents.
   - When encountering an empty stock (i.e., no resource left), cooperate to contribute towards the growth of the common pool for future rounds.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - TTAT-CT encourages cooperation when it is beneficial, but it also retaliates against defection by defecting in response and adapting its cooperation threshold accordingly. This strategy ensures that opponents are punished for their selfish behavior while still seeking opportunities to collaborate for mutual gain.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TTAT_CT(r, n, capacity, M=10):
    stock = capacity  # initialize with capacity
    cooperation_history = [0] * M  # track opponents' average cooperation

    def get_cooperation_avg():
        return sum(cooperation_history) / M

    def set_cooperation_history(cooperate):
        cooperation_history[M - 1] = cooperate
        if M > len(cooperation_history):
            cooperation_history.pop()

    for round in range(r):
        cooperation_threshold = capacity * (1 - stock / capacity)
        if round == 0:
            cooperate = True  # cooperate in the first round
        else:
            cooperate = get_cooperation_avg() > cooperation_threshold
        set_cooperation_history(cooperate)
        payoff = stock / (2 * n) if cooperate else stock / n
        consume = 2 if cooperate else 1
        stock -= consume
        growth = 2 * stock * (1 - stock / capacity)
        new_stock = min(stock + growth, capacity)
        stock = new_stock

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Rate (TFT-ACR)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a peaceful initial state. This sets a positive tone for potential cooperation in future rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds:
      - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating to maintain a harmonious relationship and reward them for their cooperation.
      - If some or all opponents defected in the previous round, defect in the current round as retaliation to their selfish behavior.
   - To promote adaptability, introduce an exploitation factor (ε) that determines the likelihood of cooperating despite past defections by opponents:
     - If a player has consistently defected (X consecutive rounds), there is an increasing probability of retaliation, depending on the value of ε.
       - For example, if ε=0.1, the probability of cooperation decreases linearly from 1 to 0.9 over X rounds.
     - Conversely, if a player has consistently cooperated (Y consecutive rounds), there is an increasing likelihood of maintaining cooperation, again depending on the value of ε.
       - For example, if ε=0.1, the probability of cooperation increases linearly from 0.9 to 1 over Y rounds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a peaceful initial state, as mentioned earlier.
   - In the last round, consider the current state of the game and act accordingly:
     - If the stock is at a critically low level (e.g., below 50% of capacity), defect to ensure there is enough resource for survival in case no growth occurs in the next round.
     - Otherwise, cooperate to maximize potential payoff and avoid damaging relationships that could impact future interactions.
   - In all other cases, follow the decision rules defined above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - TFT-ACR encourages cooperation in response to cooperative behavior but is quick to retaliate against defection, making it difficult for opponents to exploit the strategy consistently.
   - By incorporating an adaptive cooperation rate (ε), the strategy can adjust its level of forgiveness and cooperativeness based on the specific opponent behaviors encountered during a game or tournament.
   - Ultimately, TFT-ACR seeks to achieve a balance between cooperation and retaliation that maximizes payoff while exploiting opponents when possible.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   a) In the first round, cooperate (C) to build trust and goodwill. This encourages others to reciprocate cooperation in future rounds.
   b) From the second round onwards, observe opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated (C), then cooperate as well. If the opponent defected (D), defect against them as a punishment and return to cooperating in the subsequent turn if they change their behavior.
   c) Introduce an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT). The CT is initially set at 0.5 (i.e., 50% of rounds should be cooperative for cooperation to continue). In each round, update the CT based on the opponent's actions and accumulated stock depletion.
      i) If CT < 0.5 and opponent cooperates in current round, increase the CT by a small positive increment (e.g., 0.01).
      ii) If CT > 0.5 and opponent defects in current round, decrease the CT by a small negative increment (e.g., 0.01).
      iii) If both conditions are not met (i.e., opponent's action is neither cooperative nor punishing), do not change the CT.
   d) When CT reaches or falls below 0, stop cooperating and defect in every subsequent round as a sign of giving up on the opponent.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   a) In the initial round (t=1), cooperate regardless of opponent's history.
   b) In the final round (t=r), evaluate the opponent's behavior over the entire game and make the decision based on the updated CT as described above. If CT is above 0, continue to cooperate; otherwise defect.
   c) For intermediate rounds (2 ≤ t < r), follow the rules mentioned in part 1.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   a) By initially cooperating, TFT-ACT seeks to gain more resources than other strategies that may start by defecting and later regret their actions when facing TFT-ACT's reciprocal cooperation.
   b) By adapting CT based on the opponent's behavior, TFT-ACT can switch from being cooperative to punishing if it encounters an exploitative opponent. This allows it to gain more resources in the long run while teaching others that defecting is not beneficial against TFT-ACT.
   c) When faced with a strategy that consistently cooperates (e.g., a naive Tit-for-Tat), TFT-ACT can still earn high payoffs by exploiting the opponent's cooperation in the early rounds and then switching to cooperation once the CT is sufficiently high. This ensures that TFT-ACT remains competitive against various strategies.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - TFT-ACT cooperates in the initial round to build a positive relationship and avoid immediate depletion of resources.
   - If an opponent defects, TFT-ACT will defect in the subsequent rounds until the stock level reaches a certain threshold (CT). This threshold is determined based on the capacity and number of players (n) and decreases over time as the game progresses. The CT serves as a 'punishment' for opponents who have defected.
   - If an opponent cooperates, TFT-ACT will continue to cooperate until the stock level falls below another threshold (CT_min). This helps to preserve resources when cooperation is mutually beneficial.
   - When the game enters its final round, TFT-ACT will cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions, as it prioritizes a higher payoff in the last round.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_ACT(r, n, capacity, CT, CT_min):
    stock = capacity
    for round in range(1, r+1):
        if round == 1 or stock <= CT_min:  # Cooperate in initial round and when resource level is low
            action = 'C'
        elif opponent_defected_this_round:  # Defect if opponent defected in this round and resource level > CT

        if round != r and opponent_defected_this_round:  # Update CT based on exploitative behavior from the opponent
            CT = max(CT * decay_factor, CT_min)
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TFT-ACT cooperates to build a positive relationship and avoid immediate depletion of resources.
   - In the last round, TFT-ACT will cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions, as it prioritizes a higher payoff in the final round.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By decreasing the cooperation threshold (CT) when opponents defect, TFT-ACT becomes more punishing towards uncooperative opponents. This helps ensure that they receive lower payoffs and encourages them to cooperate in future rounds.
   - If an opponent consistently defects, the CT will gradually decrease over time, eventually leading TFT-ACT to always defect against them. This strategy maximizes the difference in payoff between cooperative and uncooperative opponents.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Decision rules:
   - In each round i (1 ≤ i ≤ r), the TFT-CT strategy cooperates if the average stock level over the previous three rounds is above a certain threshold (Stock Threshold). It defects otherwise. The Stock Threshold is initially set to the maximum sustainable stock level divided by 2n and adjusted dynamically based on historical stock depletion.
   - If the first three rounds are played, the strategy starts cooperating in the fourth round. In the last round, it cooperates regardless of the average stock level over the previous three rounds.

Pseudocode:
```
strategy TFT-CT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  initialize Stock Threshold = capacity / (2 * n) and counter = 0

  for each round i from 1 to r:
    if i < 4:
      continue

    calculate average_stock = average of last three stock levels in history

    if average_stock > Stock Threshold:
      action = Cooperate
    else:
      action = Defect

    consume_resource(action)

    update counter = counter + 1

    update Stock Threshold = max((Stock Threshold * 0.95), (capacity / (2 * n * (counter - 3)))) if counter >= 4 and counter < r

    append stock level after consumption to history
```

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the first round, TFT-CT starts cooperating since it has no history yet.
   - In the last round, TFT-CT cooperates regardless of the average stock level over the previous three rounds because the game ends in this round.

3. Being exploitative:
   - The strategy TFT-CT is designed to punish defection by reducing cooperation but also gradually adjusts its cooperation threshold based on historical stock depletion, making it less cooperative over time if resources are being depleted too quickly. This encourages other players to cooperate more often and avoid rapid depletion of the common pool resource.
   - By adapting its cooperation threshold, TFT-CT can maintain a balance between cooperation and defection while remaining robust to various opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_108 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), TfT-G cooperates (plays action C). This is a friendly gesture that encourages cooperation, which may be reciprocated by other players in subsequent rounds.
   - In all other rounds (t>1), TfT-G adapts its actions based on both the current state and historical actions of the opponent. If the opponent cooperates in the previous round, TfT-G cooperates as well. Otherwise, it defects. This strategy aims to punish opponents who don't cooperate while still being willing to cooperate when the opponent does so.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round (t=r): Similar to the first round, TfT-G cooperates in the final round regardless of the opponent's previous action. This encourages cooperation for potential future interactions and ensures a higher payoff compared to defecting.
   - A situation where the stock is zero: If the common pool resource reaches zero at any point during the game, TfT-G will continue playing according to its decision rules until the game ends. However, it should be noted that this situation may lead to a collapse of cooperation as there's no opportunity for growth in the stock.

3. Be exploitative:
   - While TfT-G is not inherently exploitative in nature, it can be considered exploitative due to its adaptive behavior of punishing opponents who don't cooperate and rewarding those who do. By defecting when necessary, TfT-G ensures that it does not contribute disproportionately to the depletion of the common pool resource, which may lead other players to adopt a more cooperative strategy in the long run.

Pseudocode:
```
function TitForTatGrowth(t, opponent_actions, r, n, capacity, stock) {
  if (t == 1) {
    return 'C' // Cooperate in the first round
  } else {
    if (opponent_actions[t-1] == 'C') { // If opponent cooperated last round
      return 'C' // Cooperate this round
    } else { // Otherwise, defect to punish opponent for not cooperating
      return 'D'
    }

}
```
In the given pseudocode, `t` represents the current round, `opponent_actions` is a list of actions taken by the opponent in previous rounds, `r` is the total number of rounds, `n` is the number of players, `capacity` is the maximum sustainable stock level, and `stock` is the current stock level.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_109 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Dynamics Adaptation (TT-SDA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (initiate cooperation to build trust and encourage reciprocity).
   - If opponents cooperated last round, cooperate this round (maintain cooperation if others are cooperating).
   - If opponents defected last round, also defect this round (punish defection to discourage future defections).
   - Adapt the aggression level based on stock depletion:
     - Increase aggression when the stock is low (decreasing capacity) to hasten recovery.
     - Decrease aggression when the stock is high (increasing capacity) to avoid unnecessary consumption and preserve the resource for future rounds.

Pseudocode for deciding action:
```
function decideAction(round, opponentsActionsLastRound, stockLevel):
    if round = 1:
        return "C"   # Cooperate in first round

    lastCooperators = count cooperating opponents from opponentsLastRound
    lastDefectors = count defection by opponents from opponentsLastRound

    if lastCooperators == n and stockLevel > (2n - r):  # If everyone cooperated last round and there is enough resource left for the game
        return "C"   # Cooperate to maintain trust

    elif lastDefectors == n or stockLevel < capacity/2:  # If everyone defected last round or the resource level is low
        return "D"   # Defect to punish defection and help restore resource

    else:  # Otherwise, use Tit-for-Tat with Stock Dynamics Adaptation
        aggressionLevel = (stockLevel - capacity/2) / capacity * r + 1  # Aggression level based on stock depletion and game duration
        if lastDefectors == n:  # If everyone defected last round, increase aggression level
            aggressionLevel += (n-lastCooperators)

    return "C" if aggressionLevel <= round else "D"  # Cooperate or defect based on current aggression level and round number
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, the strategy will not take into account the future consequences of its actions as there is no next round. Thus, the strategy will cooperate if it is in a position to do so, i.e., if all opponents have also cooperated in the previous round and there is enough resource left.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The TT-SDA strategy initially cooperates to build trust with other players but will quickly punish defection by adapting its aggression level based on stock depletion. This exploitative approach ensures that the strategy can recover from low resources and retaliate against opponents who do not reciprocate cooperation, while also conserving resources when the stock is high.
   - By adapting its aggression level based on stock dynamics, TT-SDA can respond to various opponent behaviors effectively, making it a robust and adaptive exploitative strategy in this common pool resource game.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_110 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-ACT will start by cooperating in the first round to foster trust, then adopt an exploitative strategy based on a dynamic cooperation threshold (CT). The CT is a percentage of the current stock that represents the minimum amount of resources required for cooperative behavior. Initially, CT = 100%, meaning that TFT-ACT will always cooperate when the stock is sufficient to ensure fair payoffs for all players.

   In subsequent rounds, if the total consumption exceeds the CT percentage of the current stock, TFT-ACT will defect in the next round as a punishment for overconsumption. The CT is then reduced by a small margin (e.g., 1%). If the total consumption is less than or equal to the CT percentage of the current stock, TFT-ACT continues cooperating and increases the CT slightly (e.g., 0.5%).

   This approach encourages cooperation when resources are abundant but responds exploitatively when other players overconsume, incentivizing them to conserve resources for future rounds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TFT-ACT cooperates as a goodwill gesture. For the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds for punishment or reward, CT remains unchanged after observing total consumption.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   By adjusting its cooperation threshold dynamically based on the group's behavior, TFT-ACT maintains an exploitative stance while still fostering cooperation when resources are abundant. The strategy punishes overconsumption by defecting in response, promoting more conservative resource management in the long run.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_111 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-ACT uses a combination of Tit-for-Tat (TFT) and an adaptive cooperation threshold to determine when to cooperate or defect. In each round, the strategy checks whether the average stock depletion rate (SD_rate) exceeds the current cooperation threshold (CT). If SD_rate > CT, the strategy defects; otherwise, it cooperates.

   a. Calculate average stock depletion rate (SD_rate):
      SD_rate = (initial stock - final stock after r rounds) / (r * initial stock)

   b. Set initial cooperation threshold (CT) to a low value such as 10%:
      CT = initial stock * 0.1

   c. For each round, update the cooperation threshold based on the opponents' behavior in the previous rounds:
      If all opponents cooperated in the last n_cooperate consecutive rounds, decrease CT by a small percentage (e.g., 0.5%) until it reaches a minimum value such as 1%.
      If any opponent defected in the last n_defect consecutive rounds, increase CT by a large percentage (e.g., 5%) until it reaches a maximum value equal to the average stock depletion rate.
      Maintain n_cooperate and n_defect as variables with initial values set to a small number (e.g., 3). Increment their respective counters each time an opponent cooperates or defects, resetting them after reaching their thresholds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, the strategy starts by cooperating since there is no history to evaluate. In the last round, the strategy cooperates if SD_rate <= CT; otherwise, it defects, hoping to punish opponents who exploited it during previous rounds.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   TFT-ACT aims to extract as many resources as possible from other players while minimizing its own losses due to stock depletion. By adapting its cooperation threshold based on the opponents' behavior, the strategy seeks to encourage cooperative play when it is beneficial and punish defections whenever possible. However, the strategy also takes into account the need for long-term sustainability by not letting the stock deplete too rapidly.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_112 = '''
 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy with Variable Defection Threshold (TFTVT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and trustworthiness (C).
   - In subsequent rounds, assess the opponents' strategies based on their previous actions. If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate (C). Otherwise, if any opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (D). This resembles a conditional reciprocity approach.
   - In the last round, always cooperate to maintain or improve final payoffs.

2. Edge Cases:
   - If an opponent never cooperates, the strategy will also never cooperate as they have shown a consistent defection behavior.
   - If there is no previous information (i.e., the first interaction with an opponent), start by cooperating to encourage reciprocity.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The TFTVT strategy maintains cooperative behavior when opponents are also cooperative, but defects immediately if any opponent deviates from cooperation, seeking to punish defection and discourage future defections. This approach can be considered exploitative because it leverages the trust and goodwill shown by cooperative opponents to take advantage of any deviation from cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFTVT(opponents_actions, round):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C' (Cooperate)
  elif round < r:
    if all(opponent_i in opponents_actions last played 'C':
      action = 'C' (Cooperate)
    else:
      action = 'D' (Defect)
  else:
    action = 'C' (Cooperate)
  return action
```

This strategy seeks a balance between cooperation and punishment to maximize payoffs against various opponent strategies while being adaptive and robust to different situations.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Rate (TFT-ACR)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and encourage opponents to reciprocate.
   - In subsequent rounds, calculate an average cooperation rate (CR) based on the opponent's behavior from previous rounds.
   - Cooperate if CR > 0.5; defect otherwise. The rationale is that if the opponent cooperates more than 50% of the time, it might be beneficial to maintain a cooperative relationship, but if not, start exploiting their defections.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions (since there is no history).
   - Last Round (r-th round): Defect, as there are no further rounds to consider the long-term consequences of cooperation.
   - Any Other Round: Calculate CR based on previous rounds and decide whether to cooperate or defect according to the decision rule.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFT-ACR strategy is exploitative by nature as it seeks to take advantage of opponents who consistently defect, while maintaining cooperation with those who reciprocate. By doing so, it maximizes its own payoff in the long run and punishes defectors when appropriate.
   - It is also robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors due to its adaptive nature; TFT-ACR adjusts its cooperative rate based on the opponent's actions, making it hard for opponents to predict or manipulate.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_114 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a tit-for-tat strategy with a slight modification for a more exploitative behavior. This strategy will aim to balance cooperation and defection while still being adaptive and robust to various opponent behaviors.

1. Decision Rules:
   - If the stock is near depletion (e.g., when stock < capacity * 0.2), always defect (D). This ensures that the strategy doesn't contribute to over-exploitation of the resource, which could lead to its depletion in later rounds.
   - If the stock is high (e.g., when stock > capacity * 0.8), always cooperate (C). This encourages building up the common pool for future gains and punishes opponents who consistently take more than their share.
   - In other cases, cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round and defect if the opponent defected in the previous round. This mimics the classic tit-for-tat strategy but is slightly modified to be more exploitative when faced with competitors who always cooperate (i.e., take advantage of them when possible).

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, the strategy will cooperate as there is no previous history for reference.
   - In the last round, the strategy will behave based on the current state, i.e., defect if the stock is near depletion and cooperate otherwise.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The slight modification to the tit-for-tat strategy allows it to be more adaptive to various opponent behaviors while still having an exploitative edge when faced with consistently cooperative opponents (i.e., taking advantage of them when possible). This ensures that the strategy performs well against a wide range of opponents, making it suitable for tournament play against other AI systems.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Stock Awareness (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build trust and maintain a higher initial stock level.
   - Subsequent rounds follow a tit-for-tat approach: if an opponent cooperates, cooperate; if they defect, defect. This encourages cooperation while retaliating against defection.
   - To avoid depleting the common pool too quickly, introduce an adaptive stock awareness feature that adjusts the probability of cooperating based on the current stock level:
     - When the stock is below the minimum sustainable level (2n), always defect to prevent further depletion.
     - As the stock approaches the maximum sustainable level (capacity), increase the probability of cooperation to promote growth. This can be done using a sigmoid function that maps the stock level to a cooperate/defect probability.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff regardless of opponent behavior by defecting if the current stock is below 2n and cooperating otherwise. This ensures no unnecessary depletion of resources in the final round.
   - In case the opponent fails to cooperate after a streak of mutual cooperation (e.g., 3 rounds), temporarily switch to defection to demonstrate uncooperative tendencies and encourage the opponent to reconsider their strategy. If the opponent returns to cooperation, resume tit-for-tat behavior; otherwise, continue defecting for several more rounds before reassessing the situation.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By initially cooperating and then adapting its actions based on the current stock level, TFT-SA aims to maintain a high enough common pool while penalizing opponents who do not reciprocate cooperation. This encourages opponents to cooperate more often in order to receive higher payoffs.
   - The strategy's adaptive stock awareness makes it less predictable and harder for opponents to exploit, as it adjusts its actions based on the current state of the common pool. This results in a more robust and effective exploitative approach.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_SA(n, r, capacity, stock):
    minimum_stock = 2 * n
    maximum_stock = capacity
    probability_cooperate = sigmoid(stock) # Use a sigmoid function to map stock level to cooperate/defect probability

    def play_round():

            action = 'C' if stock >= maximum_stock or random.random() < probability_cooperate else 'D'
        elif opponent_history[-1] == 'D':
            action = 'D'
        stock -= (2 / n) if action == 'C' else (1 / n)

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TTFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initialize a cooperation counter C_i for each player i to zero, starting at round 1.
   - In each round t:
      - If the opponent played Cooperate (C) in the previous round (t-1), play Cooperate. Increment C_i by 1.
      - If the cooperation counter C_i is greater than a threshold T, play Cooperate regardless of the opponent's action from round t-1.
      - If the opponent played Defect (D) in the previous round (t-1), or if the cooperation counter C_i is less than or equal to the threshold T, play Defect.
   - The adaptive cooperation threshold T can be set as a function of the number of players n and the capacity C:
      - For a defensive strategy, set T = floor(n/2) + 1. This ensures cooperative behavior when there are more cooperators than defectors in the previous round.
      - For an aggressive strategy, set T = ceiling(n/2). This encourages defection even if there is a slight majority of cooperators in the previous round.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, since there is no past history, play Cooperate to encourage cooperation from other players.
   - In the last round, play Defect if the cooperation counter C_i is less than or equal to the threshold T, and play Cooperate otherwise.
   - For the repeated game structure, update the cooperation counter C_i at each round to adapt to changing opponent behavior.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - By default, this strategy is not overly cooperative, as it sets a low threshold for cooperation. This encourages opponents to defect when given the chance, allowing our strategy to exploit them and gain more resources in the long run.
   - If an opponent repeatedly cooperates, the strategy will reciprocate with cooperation, building trust and maintaining a high stock level. However, if an opponent deviates from cooperation, the strategy will quickly adapt to defection to punish the deviation and regain resources.

Pseudocode for TTFT:

```
Function TTFT(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, history, threshold)
    Initialize cooperation counter C as 0

    For each round t from 1 to r:
        If t == 1 then play Cooperate (C)

        If opponent played C in the previous round (t-1) and C >= threshold then play C and increment C by 1
        Else if opponent played D in the previous round or C < threshold then play D

        Update stock level based on actions taken

    Return total payoff over r rounds
End Function

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy with Adaptive Cooperative Behavior (TfT-AB) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

TfT-AB maintains a memory of previous encounters (history of actions taken by opponents). It cooperates in the first round to provide a friendly start and to allow the resource pool to grow. After that, it responds to opponent's actions from the previous round:

- If opponent cooperated (C), TfT-AB cooperates (C) as well, fostering cooperation and allowing the resource pool to grow.
- If opponent defected (D), TfT-AB defects (D) to punish the opponent for depleting the resource pool and encourage them to cooperate in the future.

Pseudocode:
```
def decideAction(history):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to establish a friendly start
  else:
    opponentLastMove = history[round - 1]  # Retrieve opponent's action from previous round
    if opponentLastMove == 'C':
      return 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated in the previous round
    elif opponentLastMove == 'D':
      return 'D'  # Defect if opponent defected in the previous round
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

TfT-AB does not have special rules for specific rounds (first, last, or intermediate rounds). The above decision rule remains applicable throughout all rounds.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

TfT-AB is designed to be exploitative in the following ways:

- TfT-AB starts by cooperating to allow the resource pool to grow, but will soon punish opponents who defect by defecting themselves in subsequent rounds. This punishment strategy helps to discourage repeated defection and encourages cooperation from opponents.
- By remembering previous actions taken by opponents, TfT-AB can adapt to various opponent behaviors, ensuring that it does not fall victim to exploitative strategies while still maximizing its own payoff.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, the strategy cooperates (C) to build trust and contribute positively to the common pool. This encourages other players to also cooperate in subsequent rounds, maximizing the overall stock level and payoff.
   - If an opponent has previously cooperated (C), the strategy cooperates as well. This reciprocates their cooperation and maintains a positive relationship.
   - If an opponent has previously defected (D) or did not cooperate in the first round, the strategy will also defect in the current round to punish them for exploiting the common pool. Punishing defection encourages future cooperation from opponents.
   - In the last round, the strategy cooperates regardless of the opponent's previous actions to maximize the final payoff, assuming that there are no subsequent rounds.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If multiple opponents have previously defected, the strategy will also defect in the current round to maintain fairness and preserve the common pool for future rounds.
   - If some opponents have cooperated while others have not, the strategy will cooperate with those who have cooperated and defect against those who have defected. This promotes cooperation among allies while punishing defection.
   - If there are no previous interactions or if the strategy is in its first round, it will always cooperate as a starting point.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy emphasizes reciprocity and fairness, but it can also be considered exploitative since it punishes defection with defection, potentially causing opponents to reconsider their actions and shift towards cooperation.
   - The strategy is adaptive, responding to the actions of other players, and robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors due to its simple decision rules based on the game parameters, state, and history.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_119 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (Round 1): Cooperate (C), setting the tone for a cooperative environment and encouraging others to cooperate as well. This reduces the initial stock depletion, allowing for higher growth rates in subsequent rounds.
   - Maintenance Phase (Rounds 2 through r-1): Analyze previous round's stock level change (growth) compared to the capacity. If the growth rate is positive (indicating a healthy common pool), cooperate (C). Otherwise, defect (D) to stimulate other players into contributing more to restore the common pool.
   - Final Round (Round r): Cooperate (C) as it may encourage others to do so as well, maximizing overall payoffs in the last round.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If the current stock level is 0, defect (D) as there is no common pool left to consume from.
   - If the total consumption exceeds the capacity, reduce the total consumption by the excess amount and set the new stock level to the capacity. In this case, cooperate (C) if the growth rate is positive and defect (D) otherwise.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By initially cooperating, TfT-G fosters a cooperative environment, encouraging other players to do so. However, if another player starts defecting, TfT-G will respond by defecting as well, teaching the opponent that their defection is not profitable in the long run due to the stock depletion and growth dynamics.
   - By adjusting its actions based on the common pool's health (growth rate), TfT-G adapts to various opponent behaviors while maintaining a robust strategy in a wide range of situations.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tit_for_tat_growth(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C' # Cooperate in the first round

  growth = (2 * stock * (1 - stock / capacity))
  if growth > 0 and stock < capacity:
    return 'C' # Cooperate if the common pool is healthy
  else:
    return 'D' # Defect otherwise

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfTGA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This encourages others to cooperate and sets a friendly initial tone.
   - For subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C) as well. This is the "Tit-for-Tat" aspect, reciprocating cooperation with cooperation.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round. This is the punishment for defection.
   - To be adaptive and robust to changing conditions, adjust the frequency of cooperation based on the stock growth after each round. If the stock grows significantly (e.g., by more than 20%), increase the likelihood of cooperating in the next round. Conversely, if the stock decreases substantially (e.g., by more than 15%), decrease the likelihood of cooperating in the next round.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, use the current state information to decide whether to cooperate or defect. If the remaining stock would be depleted if all players defected, defect as a final punishment for any opponent that didn't help preserve the resource. Otherwise, cooperate to maximize potential payoff in the last round.
   - In the first round, as mentioned above, always cooperate.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - By initially cooperating and then reciprocating cooperation, TfTGA encourages others to cooperate as well. However, if opponents choose to defect, TfTGA will retaliate with defection, teaching them that defecting is not beneficial in the long run due to resource depletion and potential growth penalties.
   - The strategy's adaptiveness ensures it responds to changes in the environment (e.g., when other strategies start overexploiting the common pool) by adjusting its own cooperation frequency accordingly.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfTGA(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, history):
    current_round = 1
    my_actions = []
    for round in range(r):
        if round == 1:
            action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
        else:
            last_action = history[-1][current_round-1]  # Get last opponent's action
            if last_action == "C":
                action = "C"  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
            elif last_action == "D":
                action = "D"  # Defect if opponent defected last round
            else:
                growth_percentage = calculate_growth_percentage(history, round)  # Calculate growth percentage for this round
                if growth_percentage > ADJUSTMENT_THRESHOLD_UP or stock < MIN_STOCK_LEVEL:
                    action = "D"  # Defect with high probability if growth was too high or stock is low
                elif growth_percentage < ADJUSTMENT_THRESHOLD_DOWN or stock > MAX_STOCK_LEVEL:
                    action = "C"  # Cooperate with high probability if growth was too low or stock is high
                else:
                    action = random.choice(["C", "D"])  # Randomly decide between cooperation and defection when neither condition applies
        my_actions.append({"round": current_round, "action": action})
        current_round += 1
    return my_actions
```

In the pseudocode above, `ADJUSTMENT_THRESHOLD_UP`, `ADJUSTMENT_THRESHOLD_DOWN`, `MIN_STOCK_LEVEL`, and `MAX_STOCK_LEVEL` are hyperparameters that can be tuned for optimal performance. These values can be determined through simulation or trial-and-error, taking into account the specific game parameters and desired exploitative behavior.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish trust and encourage cooperation from opponents. This is based on the assumption that opponents may also cooperate initially.
   - After the first round, monitor opponent's actions for the next few rounds (say, 3). If they have cooperated more than defected (50%+), adopt a cooperative strategy to maintain the positive relationship. If they have defected more than cooperated (less than 50%), switch to a defective strategy as they are showing exploitative behavior.
   - Maintain this adaptive approach by reassessing the opponent's strategy every few rounds (say, after every 3 rounds). If their strategy shifts from cooperation to defection or vice versa, adjust your own strategy accordingly.
   - If an opponent consistently defects and causes the stock level to reach zero, switch to a defective strategy as they have shown that they are not concerned with long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, evaluate the opponent's strategy throughout the game and use the decision rules described above to determine whether to cooperate or defect.
   - In the first few rounds when assessing the opponent's strategy, be forgiving if they initially show signs of defection, as they might just be adjusting to the game dynamics. However, after a certain number of rounds (say, 5), begin strict application of the decision rules.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The TFT-SA strategy is designed to exploit opponents who do not cooperate or show signs of defection early on in the game. By adapting to their strategy and switching between cooperation and defection accordingly, the TFT-SA strategy aims to maximize its own payoff while minimizing the opponent's.
   - If an opponent consistently defects and causes the stock level to reach zero, the TFT-SA strategy will switch to a defective strategy to maintain a higher payoff. This is in line with the exploitative mindset as it takes advantage of the opponent's short-term thinking and lack of concern for long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_SA(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    cooperation_threshold = 0.5 * n
    assessment_period = 3
    forgiveness_period = 5

    strategy = 'Cooperate'

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, start by cooperating (C). This allows for the opportunity to build a cooperative relationship and potentially exploit others who also cooperate.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the previous round's aggregate action of all opponents (Agg_Action) and calculate the average cooperation rate (Avg_Cooperation) as follows: Avg_Cooperation = Agg_Action_C / n (where Agg_Action_C is the number of cooperative actions from the opponents in the previous round).
   - If Avg_Cooperation is greater than a certain adaptive threshold, cooperate; otherwise defect. The adaptive threshold (Threshold) can be calculated as follows: Threshold = min(Max_Threshold, max(Min_Threshold, (r - t + 1) / r * Max_Threshold)) where t is the current round number, r is the total number of rounds, and Min_Threshold and Max_Threshold are predefined constants. The adaptive threshold allows for more cooperation at the beginning of the game, while becoming more resistant to exploitation as the game progresses.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there will be no further rounds, cooperate only if the average cooperation rate exceeds the current adaptive threshold, as it might still lead to higher payoffs.
   - In the first round, since there is no history, start by cooperating (C) to allow for the possibility of building a cooperative relationship and potentially exploiting others who also cooperate.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By starting with cooperation and adapting based on the opposition's behavior, TFT-ACT aims to take advantage of opponents that exhibit cooperative strategies while still being resilient against those that defect.
   - As the game progresses, the adaptive threshold becomes more stringent, making it less likely for TFT-ACT to continue cooperating with opponents who have been consistently defecting. This allows the strategy to punish such opponents and potentially convert them into cooperators if their behavior changes.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tft_act(n, r, capacity, stock, t):
  threshold = min(Max_Threshold, max(Min_Threshold, (r - t + 1) / r * Max_Threshold))
  aggregated_action = count_cooperative_actions()
  avg_cooperation = aggregated_action / n

  if t == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

  elif avg_cooperation >= threshold:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate if average cooperation rate exceeds adaptive threshold

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (first round), always cooperate to build trust and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's behavior:
     - If the opponent cooperates, continue cooperating to foster mutual cooperation.
     - If the opponent defects, defect for a number of rounds equal to the Cooperation Threshold (CT). After that, revert to cooperating again. The CT is initially set low but gradually increases if the opponent continues to defect.
     - When the stock reaches a critical level (close to depletion), switch to always defecting regardless of the opponent's behavior to ensure survival.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate unconditionally.
   - In the last round, if the stock is close to depletion, always defect to maximize individual payoff. Otherwise, follow the regular decision rules based on the opponent's behavior.
   - When the game ends (not necessarily the last round), the CT is reset to its initial value for the next game.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - Exploit opponents who consistently defect by defecting back, but only to a limited extent as defined by the CT.
   - Cooperate with opponents who show signs of reciprocity, to encourage continued cooperation and maximize payoff in the long run.
   - Be less forgiving when the stock is close to depletion, prioritizing survival over potential cooperation opportunities.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_124 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Gradient Adaptation (TFT-GA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This initial gesture fosters cooperation and allows for potential partners to build trust.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponents' actions from previous rounds. If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate with cooperation (C). If an opponent defected, also defect (D) as a punishment to discourage future defections. This encourages opponents who have been cooperative and punishes those who are not.
   - To avoid being exploited by overly aggressive opponents, introduce a gradient adaptation mechanism. Calculate the ratio of times the opponent has cooperated versus defected in the past 'k' rounds (where 'k' is a predefined constant). If this cooperation-to-defection ratio is below a threshold (Tc), respond with defection (D) to protect stock levels.
   - If an opponent repeatedly cooperates or consistently maintains a cooperation-to-defection ratio above Tc, gradually increase the willingness to cooperate by decreasing the threshold for cooperation over time. Conversely, if the opponent is consistently aggressive and maintains a cooperation-to-defection ratio below Tc, gradually lower the threshold for cooperation to maintain a punishing response.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If an opponent does not cooperate in the first round, engage in punishment by defecting in the initial round as well.
   - In the last round, consider the current state of stock and the history of opponent actions to make the final decision between cooperation and defection. If there is a chance to recover the common pool resources for future rounds or if the opponent has been cooperative recently, choose cooperation (C). Otherwise, defect (D) to maximize payoff in the final round.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By being adaptive and responsive to opponents' actions, TFT-GA aims to outperform other strategies by punishing defections and fostering cooperation when appropriate. However, it will also be able to respond harshly towards overly aggressive opponents to protect the common pool resources. The gradient adaptation mechanism allows for fine-tuning the strategy's response based on an opponent's behavior, making it difficult for them to exploit or manipulate the strategy.

Pseudocode:

```python
import collections

class TFT_GA:
    def __init__(self, k=5, Tc=0.6):
        self.k = k  # lookback window size
        self.Tc = Tc  # cooperation threshold

        self.calculate_cooperation_ratio()

    def calculate_cooperation_ratio(self):
        cooperation = sum([1 for action in self.opponent_history if action == 'C'])
        defection = len(self.opponent_history) - cooperation
        self.cooperation_ratio = cooperation / (cooperation + defection)

    def decide_action(self, stock):
        if len(self.opponent_history) < self.k:
            return 'C' if stock > 0 else 'D'  # first round or insufficient history

        cooperation_ratio = self.cooperation_ratio
        if cooperation_ratio < self.Tc:
            return 'D'  # punish opponent
        elif cooperation_ratio >= (1 - self.Tc):
            return 'C'  # cooperate with opponent
        else:
            return 'D' if stock <= self.adjusted_threshold else 'C'  # adjust threshold based on stock level

    def adjust_threshold(self, new_threshold):
        self.Tc = new_threshold
```

In the given pseudocode, the `TFT_GA` class initializes with a lookback window size (k) and cooperation threshold (Tc). The `update_history()` method records the opponent's action in the most recent round. The `calculate_cooperation_ratio()` calculates the current cooperation-to-defection ratio, and the `decide_action(stock)` method determines whether to cooperate or defect based on the calculated ratio and the current stock level.

The `adjust_threshold()` function can be used to fine-tune the strategy's response by adjusting the cooperation threshold dynamically. This can be done, for example, using a linear decay function that decreases the threshold over time if the opponent has been consistently cooperative or increases it if the opponent has been aggressively defecting.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially, cooperate (C) in the first round to demonstrate goodwill and encourage reciprocity.
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if the average stock level over the past 't' rounds exceeds a predefined cooperation threshold 'c' (0 < c < 2n). Otherwise, defect (D).
   - The value of 't' increases exponentially as the game progresses to account for the longer-term perspective. An example progression could be: t = 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, and so on.
   - In case a player deviates from cooperation (D), they are punished by defecting in the next 'p' rounds before reconsidering cooperation. The value of 'p' could be set as a constant or vary according to the past average stock level.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as previously mentioned.
   - In the last round, calculate the average stock level over the past 't' rounds. Cooperate if it exceeds the cooperation threshold 'c'. Otherwise, defect to maximize payoff in the final round.
   - If the cooperation threshold 'c' or the punishment duration 'p' changes during the game due to some external factor, update these values accordingly at the start of the next round.

3. Be exploitative:
   - This strategy is designed to maintain cooperation when others do so but also punish deviations from cooperation by defecting in response and gradually rebuilding trust through cooperative actions afterwards.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peace offering to potential partners and sets a cooperative tone for the game.
   - For subsequent rounds (t > 1), observe the opponent's action from the previous round (A_{opponent}, t-1) and respond with:
     - If A_{opponent}, t-1 = C, then cooperate (C). Maintain cooperation if your opponent is also being cooperative.
     - If A_{opponent}, t-1 = D, then defect (D). Punish defection by also defecting in the current round. This creates a tit-for-tat behavior that encourages opponents to maintain cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) regardless of the opponent's previous action. Maximize payoff by accumulating as much stock as possible before the game ends.
   - In case of no opposition or initial disregard from the opponent (i.e., they consistently defect), continue with the tit-for-tat approach, but be willing to cooperate first after observing a period of cooperation from the opponent to potentially restart a cooperative cycle.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy is designed to initially maintain cooperation and only respond to defection with defection. This creates an environment where defectors do not benefit in the long run, as they will be punished for their actions. By doing so, the ATFT strategy aims to maximize its own payoff while also incentivizing cooperative behavior from opponents when possible.
   - Additionally, the strategy is adaptive and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors due to its simple decision rules and ability to adjust its cooperation based on the opponent's actions in each round. This allows ATFT to perform well against various AI systems with different strategies in tournaments.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_127 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, compare the average consumption per player over the past few rounds (let's call this 'Average Consumption').
   - If Average Consumption is less than half of the maximum sustainable stock level (capacity/(2*n)), cooperate by choosing action C. This encourages cooperation and punishes excessive exploitation.
   - If Average Consumption is equal to or greater than half of the capacity, defect by choosing action D. This is a response to perceived exploitation and punishes over-exploitative opponents.
   - To be more forgiving in the initial stages of the game, gradually increase the number of rounds considered for calculating Average Consumption until reaching the full window (let's say 10 rounds). After that, use the entire history for calculations. This will help to adapt quickly to different opponent behaviors while avoiding punishing early mistakes.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate by choosing action C, as no past behavior can be observed.
   - In the last round, defect if Average Consumption is greater than or equal to half of the capacity; otherwise, cooperate. This encourages opponents to cooperate more in the final rounds to achieve a better overall payoff.
   - If stock reaches 0 at any point, set the new stock equal to the capacity (to avoid negative stocks) and continue with calculations as normal.

3. Be exploitative:
   - ATfT is inherently exploitative by punishing opponents who over-exploit the common pool resource. This strategy aims to maintain a balance between cooperation and competition while encouraging opponents to cooperate more in the long run for better payoffs.
   - By gradually adapting to the opponent's behavior, ATfT can effectively deal with a wide range of strategies, including exploitative ones. However, it does not rely on pre-determined patterns or coordination mechanisms, ensuring fair competition with other strategies.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_128 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, I'll introduce a strategy called "Fishburn's Fixed-Point Strategy." This strategy is exploitative and adaptive, making decisions based on game parameters, state, and history without relying on communication or shared norms with opponents.

1. Decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) if the expected payoff from cooperating is greater than or equal to the expected payoff from defecting (D).
   - Defect (D) if the expected payoff from defecting is strictly greater than the expected payoff from cooperating.
   - Expected payoffs consider both immediate rewards and long-term growth potential.
   - The strategy assumes that opponents will also adapt to each other's actions over time, leading to a stable payoff distribution.

Here's a simplified pseudocode representation of the decision rules:

```
function expected_payoff(action, stock, n, r, t) {
    if (action == "C") {
        return (stock / (2 * n)) + ((stock - consumption) * 2 * (1 - (consumption / capacity)) * (r - t) / r);
    } else if (action == "D") {
        return (stock / n) + ((stock - consumption) * 2 * (1 - (consumption / capacity)) * (r - t) / r);
    }
}

function decide_action(stock, n, r, t) {
    if (expected_payoff("C", stock, n, r, t) >= expected_payoff("D", stock, n, r, t)) {
        return "C";
    } else {
        return "D";
    }
}
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round (t=1), use the initial stock level as the current stock.
   - In the last round (t=r), consider the final state of the common pool resource as the stock for that round.
   - If the current stock level is 0, the strategy defects to avoid dividing by zero errors.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By maximizing immediate payoffs while considering the long-term effects of depleting the common pool, the strategy aims to gain a higher share of resources over time compared to less strategic opponents.
   - The strategy assumes that others will eventually follow its actions if they consistently result in higher payoffs, effectively exploiting them in the long run.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_129 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to demonstrate goodwill and encourage cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate as well (reciprocating their cooperation).
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, also defect in the current round (punishing their defection).
   - To adapt to opponent behavior, introduce a small probability of cooperating even after being defected upon. This chance increases over time and encourages opponents to revert back to cooperation. The formula for this probability (p) is:
      p = min(1, 0.5 + 0.05 \* round_number)

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of previous actions by the opponent since the game ends after this round and there are no more opportunities for retaliation or reciprocation.
   - If an opponent never cooperates (always defects), the strategy will also start to defect permanently from a certain point, based on the following rule:
      If opponent never cooperated in the last 5 rounds, defect forever starting from the next round.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFT-AC is exploitative by nature as it retaliates against defection and encourages cooperation when reciprocated.
   - By introducing a small chance of cooperating even after being defected upon, the strategy aims to induce opponents to eventually return to cooperation, thus exploiting their tendency towards self-interest.

Pseudocode:
```
strategy TFT_AC(round_number, opponent_history):
  if round_number == 1:
    cooperate()
  else:
    if all(opponent_history[-1] == "C"):
      cooperate()
    elif len(opponent_history) > 4 and not all(opponent_history[-5:] == "D"):
      defect()
    else:
      cooperation_chance = min(1, 0.5 + 0.05 * round_number)
      if random() < cooperation_chance:
        cooperate()
      else:
        defect()

  if round_number == r:
    cooperate()

  if all(opponent_history == "D"):
    defect_permanently = True
    for i in range(5, 0, -1):
      if opponent_history[-i] == "C":
        defect_permanently = False
        break
    if defect_permanently:
      defect() forever from the next round

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Quota (TACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round to demonstrate goodwill and encourage potential cooperation. `if round = 1 then play C`
   - In subsequent rounds, calculate a cooperative quota based on the opponent's past actions and the game parameters. If the opponent has cooperated more than the calculated quota, mimic their cooperative behavior. Otherwise, defect to punish them for not cooperating enough. `cooperative_quota = (2n * rounds_played_so_far - current_stock) / (2n * r); if opponent's past cooperation > cooperative_quota then play C else play D`
   - To foster cooperation in the last few rounds, slightly reduce the cooperative quota to encourage opponents to build up the common pool for future gains. `if round >= (r - 5) then cooperative_quota *= 0.95`

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, always cooperate to maximize potential payoff and possibly influence opponents to cooperate as well. `if round = r then play C`
   - If an opponent defects in the first round, reciprocate by defecting for the rest of the game to punish their non-cooperation and encourage future opponents to cooperate initially. `if opponent played D in round 1 then forever play D`

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The strategy is designed to be exploitative by capitalizing on opponents' non-cooperative behavior while maximizing its own payoff. It encourages cooperation when it perceives an opportunity, but also punishes and retaliates against uncooperative opponents to discourage further non-cooperation.
   - By adjusting the cooperative quota based on the number of rounds played and the current stock level, TACT remains adaptive and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors. This strategy aims to balance cooperation and exploitation in order to maximize its own payoff while potentially inducing cooperation from other players over time.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_131 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round i, TFTSA will initially cooperate if the current stock level is above a threshold (T), and will defect otherwise. The threshold T is set based on the game parameters as follows:

   T = capacity / 2n

   After the initial round, TFTSA adopts a Tit-for-Tat approach towards other players. If another player cooperated in the previous round, TFTSA will cooperate in the current round. If another player defected in the previous round, TFTSA will defect in the current round.

   However, to account for the stock dynamics and ensure resource sustainability, TFTSA includes an additional condition: if the current stock level is critically low (below a threshold S), TFTSA will always cooperate regardless of another player's previous action. The critical threshold S is set as follows:

   S = capacity / 4n

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TFTSA will cooperate as it does not have previous actions to reference. In the last round or any round where the stock level reaches zero, TFTSA will cooperate as there is no more resource available for consumption.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While TFTSA does not explicitly aim to exploit others, it adopts an exploitative approach by cooperating only when the resource level is sufficiently high and defecting otherwise. This strategy encourages other players who consistently cooperate (and thereby deplete the resource) to switch to defecting in later rounds as the resource becomes scarce, thus indirectly promoting a more balanced resource consumption pattern.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_132 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, TfT-G will cooperate unless a player has ever defected before and the current stock is below a threshold (2/3 * capacity). If both conditions are met, it will defect.
   - If the round is the first or last, it will always cooperate, encouraging initial cooperation and avoiding unnecessary depletion of resources in the final round.
   - TfT-G maintains a memory of each player's past actions to determine if they have ever defected before.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, all players cooperate as no previous interactions exist.
   - If the current stock level is zero, TfT-G will not consume any resources and will wait for growth in the next round (stock dynamics).

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The strategy adopts a cautious approach to defection, only defecting if it has observed another player's past defection and the current stock is low. This encourages cooperative play while still punishing defection when it occurs.
   - By remembering past actions of each player, TfT-G can exploit repeated defection by defecting in response, potentially leading to a cycle of cooperation and defection that benefits itself over time due to the stock growth mechanism.

Pseudocode:

```python
class TitForTatGrowth:
    def __init__(self, n, capacity):
        self.n = n
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.memory = {}  # Memory of players' past actions

    def decide_action(self, stock, round_num, player_index, opponent_actions):
        if round_num == 1 or round_num == len(opponent_actions) + 1:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first and last rounds

        opponent_defected = any(opponent_action == 'D' for opponent_action in opponent_actions)
        if opponent_defected and stock < 2/3 * self.capacity:
            return 'D'  # Defect if an opponent has ever defected and the current stock is low
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate otherwise

    def update(self, player_action, opponent_actions):
        for opponent, opponent_action in zip(opponent_actions, self.memory.keys()):

description_EXPLOITATIVE_133 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round t, evaluate the average stock consumption per player over the last 'k' rounds (historical average). If it is less than the cooperation threshold Tc, cooperate; otherwise defect. The cooperation threshold Tc should be set based on the capacity and the number of players (n), adjusting for the desired aggressiveness or cooperativeness of the strategy.
   - Initialize Tc to a moderate value around the average consumption level in the initial rounds. Adjust Tc throughout the game based on the opponent's behavior, lowering it when encountering cooperation and raising it when faced with defection.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round (t=1), set Tc to a moderate value as mentioned earlier. Cooperate since there is no historical data to base decisions on.
   - In the last round (t=r), evaluate the current average consumption and apply the decision rule as in normal rounds, but with no further adjustments to Tc.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy's primary objective is to maximize its own payoff while exploiting opponents who deviate from cooperation. By lowering the cooperation threshold in response to defection, the strategy punishes uncooperative opponents and encourages them to return to cooperation.
   - Simultaneously, the strategy rewards cooperative opponents by maintaining cooperation, promoting long-term mutual benefits when playing against less aggressive or more cooperative strategies.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_134 = '''
 Title: Tit-for-Tat Exploitative Strategy (TfT-E) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision rules:
   - In the first round, player initiates cooperation to allow for potential partners who follow cooperative norms to survive longer in the game.
   - In subsequent rounds, if a player has cooperated in the previous round, TfT-E will also cooperate. If the opponent defected, TfT-E will defect in the current round and every future round until the opponent cooperates again (Forgiveness Period: f). Once cooperation is reciprocated, TfT-E resumes its cooperative behavior.
   - If an opponent has never cooperated, TfT-E will always defect as it assumes there are no potential partners to exploit.
   - To be more robust, TfT-E adjusts the Forgiveness Period (f) based on the average cooperation rate (CR) among opponents observed in the recent past rounds (window_size). A higher CR leads to a shorter f, allowing for quicker retaliation against defectors.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the last round, TfT-E will always cooperate to maximize its payoff regardless of opponent's action in that round.
   - In the first round or with new opponents, TfT-E initiates cooperation as mentioned earlier.

3. Exploitative mindset:
   - TfT-E is exploitative by retaliating against opponents who defect and only cooperating when it benefits the player to do so (exploiting their cooperation). The Forgiveness Period (f) allows TfT-E to punish opponents for previous defections while also being adaptive enough to return to cooperation if the opponent changes its strategy.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TfT_E(opponent_history, window_size=5):
  forgiveness_period = 10  # initial Forgiveness Period
  cooperation_rate = calculate_cooperation_rate(opponent_history, window_size)

  def action(current_round, current_stock, opponent_action_history):
    if current_round == 1 or len(opponent_action_history) < forgiveness_period:
      return 'C'  # Cooperate

    if opponent_action_history[-1] == 'C':
      return 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round

    forgiveness_period -= 1
    if forgiveness_period <= 0:
      forgiveness_period = int(cooperation_rate * forgiveness_period_max)

    if cooperation_rate > average_cooperation_rate:
      return 'C' if opponent_action_history[-1] == 'C' else 'D'  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round, otherwise defect

    return 'D'  # Defect
```

In this pseudocode, calculate\_cooperation\_rate(opponent\_history, window\_size) calculates the average cooperation rate among opponents observed in the recent past rounds using the provided window\_size. The forgiveness_period_max variable determines the maximum possible Forgiveness Period.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Forgiveness (TFT-AF)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and gives an opportunity for long-term cooperation.
   - After the first round, follow the actions of the most cooperative opponent from the previous round. If multiple opponents were equally cooperative, choose the one that has been the most cooperative over time. If no opponent was cooperative, defect (D). This encourages cooperation while penalizing defection.
   - If an opponent previously defected but later switches to cooperation, start cooperating again after a forgiveness period of r/2 rounds, where r is the number of total rounds. This promotes forgiveness and allows for reconciliation.
   - Continuously evaluate each opponent's cooperation level by calculating their average cooperation rate (cooperation rounds / total rounds). An opponent is considered cooperative if their cooperation rate exceeds a threshold value T (0 < T < 1), which may be learned through evolution or experience in the game.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - If there are ties for the most cooperative opponent, prioritize the one with the longest history of cooperation.
   - If an opponent's cooperation rate drops below the threshold after a forgiveness period, revert to penalizing defection.
   - In the last round, if no opponent has been sufficiently cooperative, defect to maximize payoff for the final round.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - Pursue a strategy that is adaptive and robust against various opponent behaviors. By responding to an opponent's actions, TFT-AF encourages long-term cooperation when possible but punishes defection with delayed retaliation. This strategy maintains a balance between cooperation and exploitation, promoting its own payoff while being sensitive to the actions of other players.
   - The introduction of the forgiveness period allows for rebuilding trust and resuming cooperation after temporary defections, which may be beneficial in situations where opponents are also using adaptive strategies.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_136 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In every round, evaluate the opponent's average consumption per round (average_consumption). If average_consumption is less than or equal to (stock / (2n)) for the past few rounds, cooperate (C). Otherwise, defect (D). The number of past rounds considered can be a tunable parameter.
   - In the first round, play C as a gesture of goodwill and cooperation.
   - In the last round, play C if opponent has been cooperative in the previous rounds, or D if not.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If average_consumption is undefined (e.g., in the first few rounds), assume the opponent is always defecting and respond accordingly.
   - If the current stock level is zero, play D since it's impossible to cooperate with no stock available.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TfTA aims to take advantage of opponents who are prone to excessive consumption while being cooperative when possible to build trust and encourage cooperation in return. It can adapt to a wide range of opponent behaviors, from extremely cooperative to extremely exploitative.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfTA(opponent, r, n, capacity, stock, round):
  # Initialize variables
  average_consumption = 0
  past_rounds = min(round, window_size)

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially cooperate (C) in the first round to foster cooperation and goodwill, setting a baseline for future interactions.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the average cooperation level across all previous rounds (excluding the first one). If the average cooperation is greater than or equal to a predefined threshold (T), cooperate; otherwise defect.
   - Update the cooperation threshold dynamically based on the current stock level and the number of players:
     - When the common pool resource is near depletion, lower the threshold to encourage players to cooperate more and prevent the collapse of the resource.
     - When the common pool resource is well-stocked, increase the threshold to allow for some defecting while maintaining a sustainable stock level.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFT_ACT(n, r, capacity, stock, round_number):
    cooperation_threshold = initial_threshold + (stock / capacity) * (capacity - 2 * n) / (2 * n * capacity)
    average_cooperation = sum(cooperation in previous_rounds) / (round_number - 1)

    if round_number == 1:
        cooperation = True
    elif average_cooperation >= cooperation_threshold:
        cooperation = True
    else:
        cooperation = False

    return cooperation
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to set a positive tone and establish trust among players.
   - In the last round, evaluate the current cooperation level like normal and make a decision based on that.
   - If the common pool resource approaches depletion (stock ≤ 2n), lower the cooperation threshold to encourage cooperation and prevent the collapse of the resource. Conversely, if the common pool resource is well-stocked (stock ≥ capacity - 2n), raise the cooperation threshold to allow for some defection while maintaining a sustainable stock level.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - This strategy takes an exploitative approach by adjusting the cooperation threshold based on the current state of the common pool resource and the number of players. It encourages cooperation when the resource is near depletion to prevent it from collapsing, but also allows for some defection when the resource is well-stocked.
   - By dynamically updating the cooperation threshold, TFT-ACT can adapt its behavior to a wide range of opponent behaviors, maximizing its chances of outperforming other strategies in the tournament.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_138 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build a cooperative relationship and establish trust. This encourages opponents to reciprocate cooperation in subsequent rounds. Pseudocode: If round = 1, then play C.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate opponent's behavior and adjust actions accordingly. If an opponent has been cooperative (C), reciprocate with cooperation. If an opponent has been defective (D), also defect to punish their previous action and encourage them to change their strategy. Pseudocode: If last_round_opponent_action(i) = C, then play C. Else if last_round_opponent_action(i) = D, then play D.
   - To avoid being exploited by opponents who continuously defect and then return to cooperation, introduce a condition that penalizes opponents for defecting too often. If an opponent has defected more than 60% of the time in the last three rounds, switch to a purely exploitative strategy (Fishburn's Strategy) until they demonstrate improved cooperation. Pseudocode: If defections_percentage(i) > 0.6 and last three rounds have mostly defective actions from opponent i, then switch to Fishburn's Strategy.
   - After switching to Fishburn's Strategy, monitor the opponent's behavior for changes towards cooperation. Once the opponent cooperates for three consecutive rounds, resume TfT-SA strategy again. Pseudocode: If opponent i has been cooperative for three consecutive rounds after switching to Fishburn's Strategy, then revert to TfT-SA strategy.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last round: Play according to the current decision rules based on the opponent's last action since there will be no future interaction.
   - In case of a tie between cooperative and defective actions when making decisions (e.g., three defections in the last three rounds), favor cooperation to maintain the possibility of continuing the cooperative relationship with the opponent.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - TfT-SA uses a combination of cooperation and exploitation by initially building trust through cooperation, but also punishing defective actions and adapting strategies based on opponent behavior. This balances both exploiting opponents who continuously defect while maintaining a cooperative relationship with those who demonstrate the potential for cooperation. The strategy also includes a condition that switches to an exclusively exploitative Fishburn's Strategy when necessary to protect against being exploited.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_139 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to promote cooperation and demonstrate a peaceful intent.
   - For subsequent rounds, monitor opponent's actions from the previous round. If they cooperated, cooperate in the current round; if they defected, also defect in the current round.
   - Introduce an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT) that increases with the number of defections received from the opponent in consecutive rounds. Once the CT is reached, cooperate only if the opponent also cooperates; otherwise, defect. The CT is designed to encourage opponents to return to cooperation while punishing continuous defection.
   - In case of a tie (i.e., both players adhering to TFT-ACT reach the same CT), cooperate to avoid mutual defections and maintain the stock level.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if the opponent has been cooperative in recent rounds or if the current CT is below a predefined minimum threshold. Otherwise, defect to maximize payoff for the final round.
   - In the first few rounds (e.g., 5), have a lower initial CT to encourage cooperation and adapt faster to different opponent behaviors.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - By adopting a Tit-for-Tat strategy with an adaptive cooperation threshold, TFT-ACT exploits opponents who repeatedly defect while also incentivizing cooperation through its adaptability.
   - The strategy's adaptiveness allows it to respond effectively to various opponent behaviors, such as exploitative strategies that initially cooperate but later defect or those that continuously cooperate.
   - By punishing defection with continued defection and offering forgiveness when opponents return to cooperation, TFT-ACT maintains a balance between cooperation and competition, maximizing payoffs over the long run.

Pseudocode:

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), demonstrating goodwill and trust. This encourages others to reciprocate in subsequent rounds. Pseudocode: `if round = 1 then action = 'C'`
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, return the favor by also cooperating (Tit-for-Tat). Pseudocode: `if last_round_opponent_action = 'C' then action = 'C'`
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, punish them by defecting as well (Retaliate-for-Defection). Pseudocode: `if last_round_opponent_action = 'D' then action = 'D'`
   - In case of no information about the previous round (e.g., first interaction with an opponent), cooperate to foster a relationship. Pseudocode: `if not has_history_with(opponent) then action = 'C'`

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Since there are no future interactions, cooperating or defecting doesn't impact the remaining rounds. In this case, the strategy aims to maximize immediate payoff. If the current stock level is above the minimum sustainable level, defect to gain a higher payoff (since there will be growth in the next round regardless). Pseudocode: `if round = r then if stock > 2n then action = 'D' else action = 'C'`
   - Empty stock: If the common pool resource is depleted, all players automatically defect as there is no stock left for consumption. However, TFT will not contribute to the depletion since it avoids defecting when the stock level is above the minimum sustainable level.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy exhibits an exploitative mindset by initially cooperating and only punishing defection in response. This fosters a relationship with other players but also provides a strong incentive for them to cooperate, as defecting will lead to immediate retaliation. By reciprocating cooperation, the strategy earns higher payoffs compared to always defecting or randomly switching between cooperation and defection strategies.
   - However, it is important to note that while TFT can be exploitative, its long-term success depends on opponents also adopting a cooperative strategy. In a population of purely selfish players, TFT will eventually deplete the common pool resource and perform poorly compared to strictly exploitative strategies. This highlights the importance of a social or cultural context supporting cooperation for the Tit-for-Tat strategy to thrive.

In summary, the proposed Tit-for-Tat strategy is adaptive, robust, and aligns with an exploitative mindset by responding to opponent actions while fostering long-term cooperative relationships. It is designed to perform well against a wide range of opponent behaviors but may struggle in populations dominated by selfish players.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Adaptive (TfT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to foster trust and goodwill.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's behaviour in the previous round and respond accordingly:
     a) If opponent cooperated, cooperate back (reciprocation).
     b) If opponent defected, defect (retaliation). This is the exploitative part of the strategy.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate to show willingness to form a cooperative relationship.
   - Last Round: Since stock cannot be negative and there's no growth in the last round, TfT-A will always cooperate in the final round as it doesn't want to jeopardize the remaining resources for potential future interactions (though this is not fully exploitative).
   - If opponent stops cooperating after a period of mutual cooperation, TfT-A will defect immediately. This is to discourage continued exploitation and punish disloyalty.

Pseudocode:
```
function TfT_A(opponent_history, round, n, r, capacity):
  if round == 1:
    return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

  if opponent_history[-1] == "C":
    return "C"  # Reciprocate cooperation
  else:
    return "D"  # Retaliate against defection

  # Check for last round and potential future interactions
  if round == r:
    return "C"  # Cooperate in the final round to preserve resources

  # Punish disloyalty by defecting immediately after a break in cooperation
  if opponent_history[-2] == "C" and opponent_history[-1] == "D":

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TTfT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round to foster a cooperative environment. (InitRound = Cooperate)
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's actions and adjust your cooperation level based on their history.
   - Maintain cooperation if the opponent has been cooperating more than 50% of the time so far (CoopPercentage >= 0.5). If not, defect. (CT = Cooperation Threshold)
   - If the opponent has previously depleted the stock, always defect for the next round to punish them and ensure your survival. (PunishmentRound)

Pseudocode:
```
def TTfT_CT(opponentHistory, round):
  if round == 1:
    return Cooperate # Be cooperative in the first round

  CoopPercentage = sum(opponentHistory.count(Cooperate)) / len(opponentHistory)

  if round == PunishmentRound: # Punish opponents who have depleted the stock previously
    return Defect

  if CoopPercentage >= CT: # Cooperate if opponent has cooperated more than the threshold
    return Cooperate
  else: # Defect when opponent is not cooperative enough
    return Defect
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, always cooperate to maximize payoff since no further rounds will follow (LastRound = True)

Pseudocode:
```
def LastRound(round, r):
  if round == r: # Last round, always cooperate
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

3. Be exploitative:
   - Cooperate only when the opponent has been cooperative most of the time to encourage their continued cooperation while punishing defections
   - Punish opponents who have previously depleted the stock to discourage such behavior and increase chances of winning
   - The adaptive cooperation threshold ensures robustness against a wide range of opponent behaviors, allowing for flexible adjustments based on how often they cooperate.

 Title: Fitness-Maximizing Exploitative Strategy (FMES) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:

FMES is designed to maximize its total payoff over the game's duration by adopting a rational and adaptive approach that prioritizes self-interest while being resilient against various opponent behaviors. The decision to cooperate or defect is based on the current stock level, the number of rounds played (r), and the strategy's accumulated payoff.

```
IF (round = 1) THEN:
    Cooperate if r <= threshold_cooperation
    Defect otherwise

ELSE IF (stock >= capacity / n) THEN:
    Cooperate

ELSE IF (accumulated payoff < payoff_threshold) AND (stock >= stock_threshold) THEN:
    Cooperate

ELSE IF (stock < stock_threshold) THEN:
    Defect
```

2. Handle edge cases:
- In the first round, FMES cooperates if the number of rounds is small enough to encourage cooperation and ensure a higher payoff in the initial stages. This behavior can help build trust with opponents and potentially exploit their cooperative tendencies.
- In the last round, FMES prioritizes self-interest by defecting regardless of the current stock level or accumulated payoff, as there are no further rounds to account for the negative impact on the total payoff due to the depleted common pool resource.

3. Be exploitative:
- FMES is designed to be exploitative by adopting a mix of cooperation and defection that maximizes its total payoff while considering the game parameters, state, and history. The strategy uses a dynamic approach to determine when to cooperate or defect based on the accumulated payoff and current stock level.
- By taking advantage of other players' cooperation in the early stages, FMES can accumulate a higher payoff compared to pure defection strategies. However, as the game progresses and the common pool resource starts to deplete, FMES will switch to defecting to ensure a sustainable payoff in later rounds.
- The use of adaptive decision rules allows FMES to respond effectively to various opponent behaviors and remain competitive in a wide range of scenarios.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round and last round, always cooperate to signal goodwill and encourage cooperation in future rounds. (C in the first round, C in the last round if stock > 0)
   - If the current stock is greater than or equal to a threshold value (T), always cooperate to help rebuild the resource. (C if stock >= T)
   - If the current player's average payoff from previous rounds is below a certain threshold, defect in the current round to punish opponents and encourage them to cooperate more in future rounds. (D if avg_payoff < min_payoff_threshold)
   - Otherwise, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round to foster ongoing cooperation. (If opponent played C in the previous round, play C. If opponent played D, play D.)

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT-ACT(round, stock, avg_payoff, min_payoff_threshold, threshold):
  if round == 1 or (round == r and stock > 0):
    return 'C'
  if stock >= threshold:
    return 'C'
  if avg_payoff < min_payoff_threshold:
    return 'D'
  opponent_action = opponent's_previous_action(round-1)
  return opponent_action
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to encourage cooperation in future rounds. (C in the first round)
   - If the stock is depleted and there are remaining rounds, set avg_payoff to zero as no payoffs were received yet and start tracking new average payoffs.
   - Adjust the min_payoff_threshold according to the number of rounds remaining if the stock has been depleted. (e.g., min_payoff_threshold *= r / (r-round))

3. Be exploitative:
   - Defect in the current round when avg_payoff is below a certain threshold, punishing opponents and encouraging cooperation in future rounds.
   - Mimic the opponent's action from the previous round to encourage ongoing cooperation, but defect if the opponent has consistently taken advantage of the strategy by not cooperating.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially in the first round, cooperate to start with a positive relationship and show good faith.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's actions from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect. This strategy encourages cooperation when it exists but also punishes defection to maintain fairness.
   - If an opponent switches from cooperation to defection, TFT will continue to cooperate for some 'leniency period' before retaliating with defection. This leniency period can be predefined based on the number of rounds or as a function of the current state of the game (e.g., if the stock is low).
   - In the last round, TFT cooperates regardless of the opponent's previous actions to leave the final resource level at its maximum possible value.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, always cooperate to set a positive tone for future interactions.
   - As mentioned earlier, in the last round, cooperate to maximize the final resource level.
   - When facing an opponent who has not played any rounds yet, TFT will use a default strategy (e.g., random cooperation or defection) until the opponent plays their first move.
   - If the current state of the game (stock level and capacity) is critical and reaching zero could lead to negative consequences for future rounds, TFT may prioritize conservation by defecting more frequently.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - While not traditionally categorized as an exploitative strategy, TFT is designed to benefit from cooperative opponents while retaliating against non-cooperative ones. This leads to a balance between cooperation and defection that maximizes payoff in the long run.
   - By mimicking the opponent's behavior, TFT avoids being easily manipulated by simple exploitative strategies (e.g., always defect) while still being able to take advantage of cooperative opponents.
   - If an opponent repeatedly defects and TFT retaliates accordingly, it can force the opponent to switch strategies or suffer a lower payoff. This dynamic may encourage more cooperation in future interactions with TFT.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Rate (TfT-ACR)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to encourage potential partners and minimize the stock depletion.
   - After the first round, maintain a cooperation rate (CR) that adjusts based on previous opponents' actions. Initialize CR = 1.0 (cooperate always).
   - If an opponent consistently cooperates for consecutive rounds, gradually decrease the CR to encourage defection and prevent over-cooperation.
   - If an opponent consistently defects for consecutive rounds, increase the CR to punish their selfish behavior and encourage cooperation.
   - If an opponent exhibits mixed behavior, maintain the current CR without making any adjustments yet.
   - In each round, compare the number of cooperative and defection actions taken by the opponent in the last N consecutive rounds (set N as a hyperparameter). Compute a cooperative score for the opponent based on this comparison.
   - If the cooperative score is above a certain threshold (set as a hyperparameter), decrease CR; otherwise, increase CR.
   - Adjust CR according to the following formula:
     CR = CR * (1 +/- learning rate * (deviation from threshold))
   - Where learning rate and deviation are set as hyperparameters. The learning rate determines how fast the strategy adapts to changes in opponent behavior, while deviation measures the degree of deviation from the cooperative score threshold.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing individual payoff without considering long-term cooperation. Cooperate if CR > 0.5, defect otherwise.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adjusting the cooperation rate based on opponent behavior, TfT-ACR seeks to identify and exploit opponents who consistently cooperate or defect.
   - Simultaneously, TfT-ACR encourages long-term cooperation by maintaining a high CR when facing cooperative opponents but also punishes those who continuously defect. This strategy attempts to strike a balance between exploitation and reciprocity.

Pseudocode:

```
function TfT_ACR(opponentHistory, n, r, capacity, CR, N, threshold, learningRate)
  if round == 1 then
    cooperate
    return
  endif

  opponentScore = countCooperativeActions(opponentHistory, N) - countDefectionActions(opponentHistory, N)

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and demonstrate a willingness to cooperate.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's average cooperation level for the past 'k' rounds (where k is a parameter that can be adjusted). If the opponent has cooperated more than half of the time in those 'k' rounds, respond by cooperating. Otherwise, defect. This rule encourages cooperation when it's reciprocated and punishes defection.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, do not take into account future rounds as there are no more rounds to come. Instead, use the same evaluation method as in regular rounds but based on the past 'k-1' rounds (since the last round is excluded).
   - If an opponent does not cooperate at all during a specific round or period of rounds, temporarily lower the cooperation threshold to encourage cooperation, and gradually increase it over time if cooperation is reciprocated. This can help avoid getting stuck in a cycle of repeated defection.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By initially cooperating and responding with defection when opponents do not cooperate, TFT-CT aims to take advantage of opponents who are prone to immediate defection. However, by gradually adjusting the cooperation threshold and allowing for flexibility in response to opponent behavior, this strategy seeks to minimize long-term losses against both cooperative and defective opponents.
   - Additionally, the strategy includes a punishment mechanism for repeated defection, which can potentially discourage other AI systems from adopting purely exploitative strategies that do not consider the long-term consequences of their actions. This creates an environment in which cooperation is more likely to emerge over time.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (round 1), play C to foster cooperation and demonstrate goodwill.
   - In subsequent rounds, monitor the average level of cooperation from opponents (average_cooperation).
   - Define a cooperation threshold (ct) based on game parameters: n (number of players) and r (number of rounds). Set ct = (2n * capacity / r) / (4n). This value represents the maximum stock level that could be sustainable for the entire game if all players consistently cooperated.
   - If average_cooperation >= ct, play C to continue fostering cooperation.
   - If average_cooperation < ct, play D to retaliate against opponents' perceived selfish behavior.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round (round 1): Play C as described in Specify decision rules.
   - Last round (round r): Play the same action as the opponent played in the previous round since the game ends after this round. This encourages opponents to cooperate in the final stages to maximize their total payoff.
   - Transition period (r/2 rounds before and r/2 rounds after): Maintain a smoother transition between cooperation and retaliation by gradually adjusting the cooperation threshold from the initial value towards the minimum stock level possible (min_stock = 2n). This allows for more adaptive behavior in response to opponent strategies that may change over time.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Cooperation is only a means to foster initial goodwill and encourage opponents to reciprocate. Once opponents exhibit selfish behavior, the strategy will retaliate to maximize its own payoff.
   - By adapting the cooperation threshold based on game parameters and opponent behavior, TFT-ACT can exploit opponents who do not reciprocate cooperation while still maintaining the potential for long-term cooperation with those who do.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_ACT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  average_cooperation = sum(history[-r/2:] / r)
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'
  elif round == r:

   Initially, in the first round, TFT-A will cooperate to foster a cooperative environment. In subsequent rounds, TFT-A will mirror the opponent's strategy from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated in the last round (C), TFT-A will also cooperate; otherwise, it will defect (D).
   Pseudocode:

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   Since TFT-A mirrors the opponent's strategy, there is no need for special handling of edge cases such as the first or last rounds, since they will be treated like any other round based on the opponent's previous action.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TFT-A maintains a cooperative approach initially but punishes opponents who defect by defecting themselves in response. This creates a situation where opponents who consistently cooperate are rewarded, while those who do not will experience punishment and may be incentivized to switch strategies towards cooperation for better outcomes. By doing so, TFT-A is able to exploit the defection of its opponents while still maintaining a cooperative stance when it sees an opportunity to benefit from it.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a friendly tone and gives opponents the opportunity to reciprocate cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's actions from the previous round:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (rewarding cooperation)
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (punish defection)
   - A key difference from the original Tit-for-Tat strategy is that TfT-G also considers the remaining stock level:
     - When the stock is low (close to 2n), prioritize cooperation to encourage conservation and prevent depletion.
     - When the stock is high, be less forgiving in punishing defection to drive opponents towards cooperation.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if the total payoff accumulated during the game exceeds the initial capacity, defect (maximize final payoff).
   - If the stock level falls below 2n at any point, defect in the current round and cooperate in the next round to start rebuilding cooperation.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TfT-G is exploitative as it adapts to opponents' actions but is also resilient to their defection, ensuring that it does not consistently suffer from being taken advantage of.
   - By prioritizing cooperation when the stock level is low and punishing defection more harshly when the stock level is high, TfT-G encourages conservation while still leaving room for exploitation if opponents choose to defect.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate to foster cooperation and build a positive relationship with opponents. (C)
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions in the previous round:
      - If opponent cooperated, cooperate back as a reward for their cooperation. (C)
      - If opponent defected, defect in response to their past action as a punishment for defection. (D)
      - Maintain this simple reciprocity strategy throughout the game.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First round: cooperate regardless of the opponent's action. This initial cooperative move aims to foster a positive relationship with opponents and encourage cooperation. (C)
   - Last round: consider the current stock level and overall game performance as indicators for the final decision. If the current stock is critically low, defect to minimize the loss of common resources and potentially encourage opponents to switch strategies in future games. Conversely, if the current stock is healthy or the overall game performance has been positive, cooperate to preserve the resource and possibly reinforce cooperation norms among opponents. The exact decision rule for the last round will be based on more sophisticated analysis of the current state and past performance.
   - Other edge cases (e.g., mid-game): adaptability is crucial in this strategy. Periodically evaluate the overall game performance, stock level, and opponent behavior patterns to adjust the response strategy accordingly. For example, if opponents consistently defect, the ATFT strategy might become more punitive by adopting a tit-for-tat approach with increased defections in response to past defections. Conversely, if opponents show cooperative tendencies, the strategy might evolve towards more cooperation to reinforce and reward this behavior.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy seeks to balance cooperation and defection based on opponent's actions, fostering a positive reciprocal relationship in cooperative scenarios while punishing defections through tit-for-tat responses. This approach encourages opponents to cooperate and rewards them for doing so, but it also effectively responds to defections with punishments that aim to deter further exploitation.
   - The ATFT strategy also has an adaptive component, which allows the strategy to evolve its response based on the observed behavior of the opponents. This adaptability enables the strategy to maintain a balance between cooperation and defection in response to various opponent behaviors, maximizing payoffs while minimizing resource depletion.
   - It's important to note that the ATFT strategy, while exploitative, does not rely on assumptions about opponent strategies or predetermined patterns of behavior. Instead, it adapts its response based on observed actions in each round, making it robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors and strategies.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
- In the first round, play C to establish cooperation and set a cooperative threshold (ct) equal to the initial capacity (capacity).
- For subsequent rounds:
  - If all opponents played C in the previous round, maintain ct and continue playing C.
  - If any opponent played D in the previous round, decrease ct by the total consumption in the last round divided by n (ct = ct - (total_consumption / n)).
  - If ct > stock, play C; otherwise, play D. This ensures cooperative behavior when possible and defect when the common pool is depleted or opponents have shown exploitative tendencies.

2. Handle edge cases:
- In the last round, prioritize a higher payoff by playing D if ct < stock, else play C.
- If ct becomes negative due to repeated defection from all opponents, reset ct to the initial capacity and revert to cooperative behavior. This prevents continuous loss of stocks and encourages opponents to cooperate again.

3. Be exploitative - Align with the exploitative mindset:
- TFT-ACT initially cooperates to promote cooperation but swiftly retaliates by defecting when opponents show signs of exploitation. This adaptive approach aims to punish exploitative behavior while still maintaining opportunities for mutual benefit when appropriate.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Forgiveness (TfTAF)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows the common pool to grow, benefiting both parties in subsequent rounds.
   - For all subsequent rounds until the last one, imitate the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect. This is known as Tit-for-Tat strategy, promoting mutual cooperation while punishing defection.
   - In the last round, cooperate (C). Regardless of the opponent's history, it's advantageous to maximize payoffs in the final round by contributing to the common pool.

2. Edge Cases:
   - If an opponent defects in the first round and then switches to cooperation, forgive them by cooperating back. Maintain this forgiveness for a certain number of rounds (forgiveness period), then revert to imitating their previous action. The forgiveness period can be set to a fraction of total rounds to balance exploitation with long-term cooperation.
   - If an opponent continues to defect after the forgiveness period, resume defection to punish their behavior and encourage a switch to cooperation.
   - In case the opponent never cooperates, continue to defect until the last round when it's beneficial to cooperate regardless of the opponent's actions.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TfTAF adapts to the opponent's strategy by punishing defection and encouraging cooperation. By imitating their previous action, the strategy assumes that opponents will also adapt to each other's moves over time. However, it maintains an exploitative edge by retaliating against defection with defection, causing a reduction in the common pool that can harm both players in the long run.
   - The forgiveness mechanism allows for potential cooperation recovery and offers an opportunity for opponents to switch strategies, but it also limits the exploitation potential, as continued defection will eventually be punished.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfTAF(opponent_history, n, r, capacity, current_stock):
    forgiveness_period = int(r * 0.2) # Set forgiveness period to 20% of total rounds
    current_round = 1
    strategy = "C" # Start with cooperation

    while current_round <= r:
        if current_round == 1:
            strategy = "C" # Cooperate in the first round
        elif current_round == r:
            strategy = "C" # Cooperate in the last round
        else:
            if current_round - forgiveness_period <= opponent_history.index(-1) < current_round:
                strategy = opponent_history[-1] # Use the same action as the opponent from the previous round (Tit-for-Tat)
            elif opponent_history[-1] == "C": # If the opponent cooperated, forgive them and cooperate back
                strategy = "C"
            else: # Otherwise, defect to punish defection
                strategy = "D"

        # Payoff calculation
        payoff = current_stock / (2 * n) if strategy == "C" else current_stock / n

        # Update the current stock and opponent history
        total_consumption = sum(opponent_history[-n:])
        new_stock = max(current_stock - total_consumption + 2 * current_stock * (1 - current_stock / capacity), 0)
        current_stock = min(new_stock, capacity)
        opponent_history.append(strategy)

        # Increment the round counter and continue the game loop
        current_round += 1

    return strategy, sum(payoff for _ in range(r)) # Return the final strategy and total payoff over r rounds

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-with-Foresight (TFTF)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a harmonious environment and encourage cooperation from others in the following rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate with cooperation. If they defected, also defect. This mimics the Tit-for-Tat strategy but adds foresight by considering the potential impact of current actions on future stock levels and payoffs.
   - To make informed decisions, calculate the anticipated payoff for each action (cooperate or defect) based on the current state (stock level), game parameters, and the opponent's history of actions. Choose the action that maximizes the expected payoff in the long run.
   - When facing multiple opponents, evaluate each opponent individually and decide whether to cooperate or defect with each one based on their respective histories.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize cooperation only if it maximizes the expected payoff compared to defection considering the current state, game parameters, and opponents' histories.
   - If an opponent deviates from a cooperative or defective pattern during the game, reassess the decision rules based on the new pattern to maintain the exploitative nature of the strategy.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The TFTF strategy is inherently exploitative as it aims to punish opponents who defect while maintaining cooperation with those who reciprocate. This encourages cooperation for as long as possible but also allows the strategy to defect when faced with selfish or uncooperative opponents, ensuring higher payoffs in the long run.
   - To enhance exploitation potential, the strategy can incorporate a learning component that adjusts the response to deviations based on the perceived success of past actions against specific opponents. This adaptability allows TFTF to counter opponent strategies effectively while still maintaining a cooperative appearance when beneficial.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfT-GA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round t, TfT-GA starts by cooperating (C) if the total consumption in the previous round (t-1) was less than or equal to the average consumption per player over the first (t-2) rounds. If the total consumption in the previous round was more than the average consumption, it defects (D). This decision rule is designed to punish excessive resource consumption while encouraging cooperation when resources are conserved.

Pseudocode for decision rules:
```python
def decide_action(t):
    if t == 1:
        return 'C'  # First round, always cooperate

    avg_consumption = sum(total_consumptions[0:t-2]) / (t - 2)
    if total_consumptions[t-1] <= avg_consumption:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate if consumption is less than average
    else:
        return 'D'  # Defect if consumption is more than average
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round (t=1), TfT-GA cooperates regardless of previous rounds' information since there is no history to compare against. In the last round (t=r), it chooses its action based on the current average consumption, following the decision rule specified above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

The TfT-GA strategy adopts an exploitative approach by punishing excessive resource consumption and rewarding moderate or low consumption levels. By doing so, it encourages cooperation when others conserve resources while still gaining a comparative advantage when opponents overconsume. This adaptive behavior helps in achieving better payoffs against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Fractal Tit-for-Tat (AFTFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   AFTFT starts by cooperating in the first round (C), mimicking a cooperative approach to encourage cooperation from opponents. From the second round onward, the strategy makes decisions based on an adaptive fractal approach that aims to punish defection while being forgiving of past mistakes and promoting long-term cooperation.
   - If the opponent cooperates (C), AFTFT continues to cooperate (C).
   - If the opponent defects (D) and there are remaining rounds (r > 1), AFTFT defects in the current round and adapts its future decisions based on the number of previous defections. This number is tracked using a fractal-like pattern, where the depth increases by one after each consecutive series of defections from the opponent. The strategy becomes increasingly punishing with increased depth (more defections) but forgives past mistakes by decreasing the depth back to 1 if the opponent cooperates again (C).
   - If there are no remaining rounds (r = 1), AFTFT defects regardless of the opponent's action, as there is no opportunity for retaliation or future cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, AFTFT cooperates (C).
   - In the last round, AFTFT defects (D), as there is no opportunity for future retaliation or cooperation.
   - If the opponent has not defected yet, AFTFT maintains its current depth. However, if the opponent defects, AFTFT increments its depth by one, adapting a more punishing approach. Depth decreases back to 1 if the opponent cooperates again (C).
   - If the stock level falls below the minimum sustainable level (2n), AFTFT temporarily abandons the fractal-like pattern and prioritizes cooperation to help restore the common pool resource. This can be implemented by setting a threshold for minimum stock level, and when reached, the strategy cooperates (C) until the stock level is above the threshold again.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   AFTFT's primary objective is to maximize its payoff while being aware of opponents' strategies. The adaptive fractal approach allows AFTFT to punish repeated defections, thereby discouraging a purely exploitative strategy from opponents. At the same time, AFTFT promotes cooperation when it benefits the common pool resource and helps maintain long-term interactions with other strategies.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to build trust and goodwill with opponents.
   - In subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate cooperation. If the opponent defected, also defect in response. This aims to punish defection while encouraging cooperation.
   - As the game progresses and the stock gets lower, prioritize self-preservation by defecting more frequently to ensure there is enough resource for future rounds.
   - In the last round, cooperate if the opponent has been consistently cooperative throughout the game or if defection could lead to insufficient resources for both players. Otherwise, defect to gain as much resource as possible.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    function get_opponent_action(history):
        # Check if opponent cooperated in the last round
        if history[-1] == 'cooperate':

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   The strategy has been designed to handle these edge cases as described above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   The ATFT strategy is exploitative by punishing opponents who defect and not cooperating when facing an opponent who consistently defects, thereby gaining more resources in the long run. However, it also encourages cooperation by reciprocating positive behavior from other players to maximize collective resource growth.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adjustment (TfTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to foster a collaborative environment. This encourages other players to do the same in return, promoting mutual cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   `if round == 1 then cooperate`

   - From the second round onwards, observe and respond to opponents' actions from the previous round:
       a) If all players cooperated in the last round, continue cooperating as this strategy has been successful for everyone.
         ```if all(other_players_cooperated_last_round) then cooperate```

       b) If some players defected and some cooperated in the last round, assess whether the total stock depletion exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 50%). If it does, defect to restore the common pool resource. This is an exploitative move since it punishes excessive stock consumption by others.
         ```if any(other_players_defected_last_round) and (total_consumption_last_round > capacity/2) then defect```

       c) If all players defected in the last round, continue defecting to encourage opponents to change their strategies as well. This is a long-term exploitative move intended to force others into a more cooperative behavior.
         ```if all(other_players_defected_last_round) then defect```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate since there will be no further rounds to punish or reward opponents based on their actions.
     ```if round == r then cooperate```

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By adjusting stock consumption based on past actions of other players and the state of the common pool resource, TfTSA takes advantage of opponents' inconsistent or uncooperative behavior while still promoting cooperation when it benefits all parties. This strategy aims to force other AI systems into more cooperative strategies over time.

Pseudocode:
```
function TfTSA(round, r, n, capacity, stock):
    if round == 1 then
        return Cooperate()
    end if

    last_round_consumption = CalculateTotalConsumptionFromLastRound(stock)

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TfT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially, cooperate in the first round (first move is often benevolent).
   - For subsequent rounds, adapt strategy based on opponent's actions in the previous round:
     - If the opponent cooperated, continue to cooperate.
     - If the opponent defected, also defect for one round as punishment but revert to cooperation from the next round ( Tit-for-Tat principle).

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, there's no need for punishment or retaliation since the game ends soon anyway; cooperate in the last round regardless of opponent's previous action.
   - If an opponent never cooperates, continue defecting to punish the non-cooperative behavior (Tit-for-Tat's rigidity ensures the strategy doesn't get taken advantage of).

3. Being Exploitative:
   - TfT-AC appears benevolent at first but can also be ruthless if provoked. This makes it exploitative because opponents might initially cooperate due to its seemingly cooperative nature, only to find themselves punished when they defect.
   - The adaptive cooperation ensures that the strategy doesn't get trapped in a cycle of continuous defection with another adversarial opponent, as it will eventually revert to cooperation once punished.

Pseudocode:

```python

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to initiate a cooperative environment. This encourages opponents to cooperate and builds trust.
   - After the first round, observe the opponent's actions in the previous round. If they cooperated, cooperate; if they defected, defect.
   - Maintain this pattern of mirroring the opponent's behavior from the previous round. This simple yet adaptive strategy demonstrates a willingness to cooperate while also punishing defection with immediate retaliation.
   - If the opponent continues to cooperate, the relationship remains harmonious. However, if the opponent defects repeatedly, TFTSA will also repeatedly defect, escalating the conflict if necessary.
   - In cases where the stock level falls below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), prioritize self-interest over cooperation and defect more frequently to ensure survival. This is an adaptation to situations where resources are scarce or rapidly depleting.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if the stock level allows for it, as this could result in higher payoffs than defection. If the stock level is too low, defect to secure some resources for the next game.
   - When switching from cooperation to defection or vice versa, make a gradual transition to minimize sudden changes that may disrupt the opponent's strategy and potentially lead to unwanted outcomes.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFTSA is designed to be exploitative by adapting its behavior based on the opponent's actions. By defecting when necessary, it ensures a higher payoff when the opponent defects, while also punishing defection with immediate retaliation.
   - In addition, TFTSA takes advantage of cooperative opponents by initially cooperating and maintaining cooperation as long as the other player does so. This allows TFTSA to gain resources more efficiently during periods of cooperation.
   - When the stock level becomes low, TFTSA prioritizes self-interest over cooperation, which can be seen as exploitative when the opponent continues to cooperate even in scarce resource situations.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   The TFT strategy initially cooperates in the first round (C), then mimics the opponent's previous action in subsequent rounds. If the opponent has cooperated, TFT also cooperates; if the opponent has defected, TFT defects as well. This reciprocity encourages cooperation but can also punish defection.

Pseudocode for decision rule:
```
function decideAction(opponentAction_t-1):
  if t == 1 then return 'C' (Cooperate)
  else if opponentAction_t-1 == 'C' then return 'C' (Cooperate)
  else return 'D' (Defect)
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   Since TFT is a reciprocal strategy, it will cooperate initially and continue to mimic the opponent unless the game ends. There are no specific adaptations required for edge cases like the first or last round.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While TFT may appear cooperative, its reciprocal nature can be seen as an exploitative strategy. If opponents frequently cooperate, TFT benefits from their cooperation while occasionally defecting to ensure that the stock does not deplete too quickly. Conversely, if opponents often defect, TFT punishes them by matching their actions. This encourages a balance between cooperation and defection, making it difficult for other strategies to profit excessively at TFT's expense.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_162 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, TFT-ACT maintains a cooperation threshold (initially set to 2n), which determines the number of previous rounds where the player has cooperated with the opponent. If the opponent cooperates in the current round, TFT-ACT also cooperates; if the opponent defects, TFT-ACT decreases its cooperation threshold by one. If the cooperation threshold reaches zero, TFT-ACT starts defecting until the opponent cooperates again, then resets the cooperation threshold to the initial value (2n).

Pseudocode:
```
def tft_act(opponent_history):
    cooperation_threshold = 2 * n
    for round in range(1, r+1):
        if opponent_history[-round] == 'C':  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last turn
            return 'C'
        else:  # Decrease cooperation threshold and defect otherwise
            cooperation_threshold -= 1
            if cooperation_threshold <= 0:
                cooperation_threshold = 2 * n  # Reset when opponent cooperates
    return 'D'  # Defect in the last round since there is no opponent history for next rounds
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, TFT-ACT starts with a cooperation threshold of (2n) and cooperates because it has no prior history to evaluate the opponent's behavior. In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds, TFT-ACT does not need to maintain a cooperation threshold and simply chooses its action based on the current state and opponent's last move as in the regular decision rules.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

TFT-ACT is designed to be cooperative when the opponent demonstrates cooperation, but it can punish opponents who repeatedly defect by shifting its strategy to defecting as well. However, TFT-ACT will also cooperate if the opponent starts cooperating after a history of defections. This adaptive approach makes TFT-ACT more robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors, allowing it to potentially exploit opponents who are prone to defecting in the early stages of the game. At the same time, TFT-ACT can also benefit from cooperation when the opportunity arises, which aligns with the idea of being exploitative in repeated games like this one.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture to encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - For every round t (t > 1), assess the average stock level over the past few rounds (e.g., last 3 or more) and compare it with the initial capacity. If the average stock level is above 50% of the initial capacity, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - If the average stock level has been consistently high (above 50%) for a certain number of rounds, adapt the minimum threshold for cooperation to be slightly higher than 50%. Conversely, if the average stock level is consistently low, lower the threshold for cooperation. The adaptation speed should be slow to avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuations in the stock levels.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the current stock level or past behavior as there are no more rounds following it.
   - If the current stock level is zero (meaning all players have defected in the previous round), defect in the current round to help restore the common pool resource. However, start cooperating again once the stock level recovers to a certain level (e.g., 10% of initial capacity).
   - If there are no more opponents left who still cooperate, switch strategies to one that is less exploitative or entirely cooperative to improve long-term performance.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The TFTSA strategy aims to maximize payoffs by punishing defectors when the stock level is low and encouraging cooperation when it's high. It adapts its behavior based on the current state of the game and the historical trend of the common pool resource.
   - By cooperating initially and only defecting when the average stock level drops significantly below 50%, TFTSA tries to maintain a healthy common pool while still exploiting opponents who consistently defect or overexploit the resource.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growing (TfT-G)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to build a positive relationship and avoid immediate exploitation by others. If all players cooperate, continue cooperating.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the average cooperation level from the previous r/2 rounds (assuming an even number of rounds) or r-1 rounds (for odd numbers).
   - If the average cooperation level is above a threshold T, cooperate to maintain the positive relationship; otherwise, defect to retaliate against non-cooperative players. The threshold T can be set as follows:
     ```
     T = 0.6 * (n / r) + 0.4
     ```
   - Adjust the threshold T slightly towards cooperation in the last few rounds to encourage cooperation for a better overall payoff. This can be done by decreasing the lower bound of T and increasing the upper bound while maintaining the average as before.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier.
   - If r is odd, consider the last (r-1) rounds instead of r/2 for calculating the average cooperation level.
   - In the last few rounds, adjust the T threshold slightly to encourage cooperation. For instance, when there are 10 rounds left:
     ```
     Lower bound = T * 0.95
     Upper bound = T * 1.05
     ```
   - If the average cooperation level is not sufficient for cooperating in the last round(s), defect to maximize the final payoff by exploiting any remaining non-cooperative opponents.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adjusting the T threshold based on the number of rounds, the strategy is more likely to punish non-cooperative players and encourage cooperation from others.
   - In the last few rounds, the strategy shifts towards a more aggressive stance by defecting when necessary to gain an advantage over opponents who have been previously non-cooperative.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_165 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Stock Exploiter (ASE)

1. Decision Rules:
   - ASE cooperates when the current stock is above the critical point C_crit, defined as n^2/4. This encourages cooperation while the common pool has plenty of resources, exploiting opponents who also cooperate.
   - ASE defects when the current stock falls below a second critical point D_crit, calculated as (n^2 - n)/(4*n). This ensures defection once the common pool is depleted enough to provide an advantage, even if all other players continue cooperating.
   - In all other cases where the current stock level is between C_crit and D_crit, ASE will defect with a probability P_defect that increases as the stock decreases:
     ```
     P_defect = (stock - C_crit) / (D_crit - C_crit)
     ```

2. Edge cases:
   - In the first round, ASE cooperates, encouraging cooperation and potentially exploiting opponents who defect early on.
   - In the last round, ASE follows the same decision rules as in other rounds but pays attention to the state of the common pool. If the stock is close to the capacity or depleted, ASE will defect regardless of the current stock level, aiming to leave as much of the remaining resources for future interactions (i.e., other tournament rounds).

3. Exploitative mindset:
   - By following the decision rules and probabilities described above, ASE encourages cooperation when it benefits the strategy but will also switch to defection strategically if the common pool resource becomes depleted enough to gain an advantage. This adaptive behavior exploits both cooperative and defecting opponents while being robust against various strategies from competing AI systems.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
- In the first round, the player will always cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and build trust among opponents.
- From the second round onwards:
  - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, the player cooperates as well.
  - If the opponent defected in the previous round, the player evaluates the average cooperation level of the opponent over the last 'a' rounds (where a is a predefined constant). If the average cooperation level is above a certain threshold (CT), the player cooperates; otherwise, it defects. This adaptive approach allows for forgiveness and encourages opponents to return to cooperation when they deviate.
- In the last round, if the remaining stock is above the capacity/n, the player will cooperate to maximize potential payoff. If not, the player will defect.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
- In the first round, the player cooperates as described earlier.
- In case of a tie (two or more opponents defecting or cooperating simultaneously), the player takes their own action from the previous round. This rule helps maintain consistency and avoids getting caught in endless cycles of defection when multiple opponents deviate at once.
- If the remaining stock becomes zero, the game ends, and the player does not make any decisions. In the next round, the initial capacity is used as the starting stock.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
- The TFT-CT strategy seeks to maximize payoffs while being responsive to opponents' actions. By forgiving occasional defection and adapting its cooperation level based on the average cooperation of its opponents, the strategy encourages cooperative behavior from others while still taking advantage of opponents who consistently defect.
- However, it also punishes persistent defection by reducing cooperation, eventually leading to a lower payoff for such opponents. The adaptive nature of TFT-CT allows it to be robust against various opponent strategies and ensures its long-term success in the game.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

Initially, players start by cooperating to build up a common stock and develop trust among participants. If another player cooperates in the current round, the TFT player will cooperate as well. However, if another player defects, the TFT player will also defect in the next round. The TFT player will continue this cycle of mimicking the opponent's previous action (cooperation or defection).

Pseudocode:
```
def playRound(opponentAction):
  if first_round:
    return "C" # Cooperate initially to build trust

  if opponentAction == "C":
    return "C" # Mimic the opponent's cooperation

  else:
    return "D" # Punish the opponent's defection with defection
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, TFT will cooperate to initiate a cooperative interaction. In the last round, TFT might cooperate or defect based on the opponent's previous action, as the game is repeated and long-term payoffs matter more than short-term gains. However, in cases where the last round is detected, TFT can be modified to prioritize cooperation as a way of signaling goodwill towards other players for future interactions.

Pseudocode:
```
def determineLastRound():
  # Implement logic to detect the last round based on the game parameters
  ...

if determineLastRound():
  if opponentPreviousAction == "C":
    return "C" # Cooperate in the last round as a goodwill gesture
  else:
    return "D" # Punish opponent's defection in the last round
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

TFT strategy is not inherently exploitative, but it can be seen as such when playing against opponents who are prone to repeated defections (tit-for-tat behavior). By adopting a similar approach and punishing defection, TFT prevents other players from gaining an unfair advantage through continuous exploitation.

However, the key difference between TFT and an exploitative strategy is that TFT aims for long-term cooperation whenever possible while still punishing defection to maintain fairness in the game. This could result in lower immediate rewards but potentially lead to higher overall payoffs in repeated interactions with other players.

In summary, Tit-for-Tat (TFT) is a simple yet robust strategy that involves mimicking an opponent's previous action and punishing defection. It is adaptive to a wide range of opponent behaviors and can be modified to handle edge cases such as the first round or last round in a repeated game.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_168 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, the ATFT strategy starts by cooperating (C). If a player encounters another player's defection (D), it will also defect in the subsequent rounds until the offending player returns to cooperation. Once the offending player cooperates again, the ATFT strategy resumes cooperating as well. This mimics the Tit-for-Tat strategy from classic game theory but with a slight adaptation for this game's specific dynamics.

Pseudocode:
```python
def atft(player_index, opponent_history, round, n, capacity):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        last_round = opponent_history[-1]  # Get opponent's action from last round
        if last_round == 'D':  # If opponent defected, defect as well
            action = 'D'
        elif last_round == 'C':  # If opponent cooperated, cooperate back
            action = 'C'
    return action
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   There are no specific edge cases to handle since the strategy already accounts for the first and last rounds by starting with cooperation and not altering behavior based on round number. However, if desired, additional logic can be added to prioritize long-term sustainability or exploit opponents during the final rounds when resources may be scarce.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   ATFT has an exploitative aspect as it punishes defection by defecting back, while rewarding cooperation with cooperation. However, to further enhance its exploitative nature, a variation of the strategy could include a "slightly forgiving" feature: if the opponent switches from defection to cooperation after multiple rounds of defection, ATFT may forgive them more quickly than strictly adhering to its original tit-for-tat pattern. This modification allows for potential exploitation while also promoting cooperation when beneficial.

Pseudocode (modified ATFT with forgiveness):
```python
def atft_with_forgiveness(player_index, opponent_history, round, n, capacity, forgiveness_limit=3):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        last_round = opponent_history[-1]  # Get opponent's action from last round
        if last_round == 'D':
            consecutive_defections += 1
            if consecutive_defections >= forgiveness_limit:
                action = 'D'  # Defect after reaching the forgiveness limit
            else:
                action = 'D'  # Continue defecting until reaching the forgiveness limit
        elif last_round == 'C':
            consecutive_defections = 0  # Reset consecutive defections counter if opponent cooperates again
            action = 'C'  # Cooperate back when opponent switches to cooperation
    return action
```

description_EXPLOITATIVE_169 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Quota (TFT-ACQ)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round to build trust and cooperation potential.
   - In subsequent rounds, maintain cooperation if the total consumption in the previous round was less than or equal to the average consumption per player over the game's history (i.e., r rounds). Otherwise, defect.
   - Adaptively adjust the cooperative quota based on the opponent's behavior:
     - If the opponent has been cooperating, increase the cooperative quota slightly; if the opponent has been defecting, decrease it slightly. This encourages continued cooperation when it is beneficial and punishes defection while still allowing for forgiveness.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as per the initial trust-building mechanism.
   - In the last round, since future interactions are no longer possible, evaluate the total consumption in the previous rounds and act accordingly based on the decision rules mentioned above.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - Cooperative quota adjustments promote retaliation against defection and forgiveness when cooperation resumes, making it difficult for opponents to exploit the strategy consistently.
   - The strategy encourages initial cooperation but gradually shifts towards more selfish behavior if opponents repeatedly defect, making it adaptive in various scenarios while still maintaining an exploitative edge.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Plus Strategy (TfT+) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

   The TfT+ strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection based on the opponent's behavior, stock level, and game round. It starts by mimicking the Tit-for-Tat strategy from game theory, but adds an exploitative twist by adjusting its response to the opponent.

   If the opponent cooperates, TfT+ also cooperates. If the opponent defects, it will defect in the same round and the next r/2 rounds (punishing the opponent), then switch back to cooperation after that. This encourages opponents to cooperate while still providing a strong response when necessary.

   Pseudocode for decision rule:
   ```
   function decideAction(opponent_action, round, stock, r):
       if round <= r/2 and opponent_action == "defect":
           return "defect"
       if round > r/2:
           return opponent_action
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

   For the initial round, TfT+ will cooperate since it starts by mimicking Tit-for-Tat strategy. In the final round, TfT+ will also cooperate if its opponent has been consistently cooperative throughout the game; otherwise, it will defect to gain as much resource as possible before the end of the game.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

   The TfT+ strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by adapting its behavior based on the opponent's actions. It punishes opponents who defect in the initial stages, but also switches back to cooperation after a certain period to encourage future cooperation. This approach allows it to both exploit uncooperative opponents while still promoting cooperation when possible.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_171 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture to encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1):
     - If an opponent has consistently cooperated in the past (previous r-1 rounds), continue to cooperate (C).
     - If an opponent has defected in at least one of the previous r-1 rounds, also defect (D) to punish them for their earlier defection. However, if a defector later switches to cooperation, resume cooperation after the punishment round. This encourages opponents to change their strategy and cooperate again.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), follow the decision rules as usual because the game is finite and players may still be influenced by the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds.
   - If an opponent never cooperates, always defect (D) to maximize payoffs in the long run, even though it might lead to a lower total game payoff due to the lack of cooperation.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - While not strictly exploitative as defined by game theory, this strategy aims to punish opponents who do not cooperate while also encouraging cooperation when possible. It rewards long-term cooperators and punishes short-term defectors, making it less susceptible to exploitation in the context of a repeated game with dynamic state.
   - The ATfT strategy is simple, robust, and aligns with an exploitative mindset by punishing opponents for defection while still maintaining the potential for cooperation when it benefits the player.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_172 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, the ATfT strategy initially cooperates (C) in the first round. After that, it responds to the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, the strategy will cooperate as well. Otherwise, if the opponent defected, the strategy will defect in the current round.

Pseudocode:
```
def ATfT(opponent_action_history):
  if round == 1:
    return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

  last_round = len(opponent_action_history) - 1
  opponent_last_action = opponent_action_history[last_round]

  if opponent_last_action == "C":
    return "C"  # Cooperate if the opponent cooperated last round
  else:
    return "D"  # Defect if the opponent defected last round
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

The strategy remains unchanged for the first round and the last round since the strategy is adaptive based on the opponent's actions rather than considering specific game positions or rounds.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

Although the ATfT strategy may appear somewhat cooperative, it can still be considered exploitative because its primary goal is to mimic the opponent's behavior and take advantage of their actions. By defecting when the opponent defects, the strategy aims to punish opponents who choose not to cooperate, potentially inducing them to switch strategies towards cooperation in future rounds.

The ATfT strategy can be seen as a simple form of reciprocity where cooperation is rewarded with cooperation and defection is met with defection. This reciprocal behavior may encourage long-term cooperation between opponents who adopt similar strategies. However, the strategy remains exploitative due to its ability to punish defectors when appropriate.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate to initiate a cooperative environment and ensure the stock level remains high.
   - For subsequent rounds (2 <= t <= r):
       - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, return the favor by cooperating in the current round. This is to maintain cooperation and build trust.
       - If opponent defected in the previous round, retaliate by defecting in the current round. This is intended to punish defection and encourage cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round (t=r): Cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action, as the game ends after this round.
   - If opponent doesn't make a move (unknown action), cooperate in the current round to maintain high stock levels and encourage cooperation for future rounds.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Pursue immediate payoff benefits by retaliating against defection, but also consider long-term rewards through cooperation.
   - Gradually build trust with opponents by initially cooperating and maintaining that cooperation as long as the opponent reciprocates.

Pseudocode:
```
function TitForTat(opponentAction_t-1):
  if t = 1 then
    return 'C' (Cooperate)

  if opponentAction_t-1 = 'C' then
    return 'C' (Cooperate)

  if opponentAction_t-1 = 'D' then
    return 'D' (Defect)

  if t = r then
    return 'C' (Cooperate)

description_EXPLOITATIVE_174 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In every round t, starting from round 2 until the last round, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), then ATFT cooperates. If an opponent defected in the previous round (t-1), then ATFT defects. This is a simple and adaptive strategy that responds to the opponents' past actions, but also shows a willingness to cooperate.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(history):
  if t = 1:
    // First round, start by cooperating
    return "C"
  else:
    previous_action = history[t-1]
    if previous_action == "C":
      // Cooperate in response to cooperation
      return "C"
    else:
      // Defect in response to defection
      return "D"
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, ATFT starts by cooperating as there is no history to base a decision on. In the last round (r), ATFT considers the accumulated payoff over all rounds and chooses an action that maximizes the overall payoff. Since this strategy focuses on exploitation, it will defect in the final round if the payoff advantage outweighs the benefits of potentially retaining a cooperative relationship for future interactions.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFT(history):
  if t = 1:
    // First round, start by cooperating
    return "C"
  else if t = r:
    // In the last round, choose action based on overall payoff
    total_payoff = sum payoffs from all rounds
    if total_payoff with cooperation outweighs total_payoff with defection:
      return "C"
    else:
      return "D"
  else:
    previous_action = history[t-1]
    // ... (same as above)
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

The ATFT strategy maintains a cooperative stance initially and responds to the opponents' actions, showing a willingness to cooperate in the hope of reciprocation. However, in the final round, it makes an exploitative choice by prioritizing payoff maximization over fostering continued cooperation. This adaptive strategy can be seen as both exploitative and resilient against various opponent behaviors.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_175 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFTAT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to show good faith and establish a potential long-term cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe each opponent's action history and adapt the cooperation decision using an Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT). If the proportion of cooperation from opponents exceeds ACT during the last N_lookback rounds, cooperate; otherwise, defect.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, defect regardless of the opponent's history as there is no future interaction to punish or reward.
   - If the stock level falls below 1 in any round (i.e., the common pool resource is depleted), consider it an edge case and immediately switch to defecting to avoid further depletion.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFTAT strategy will initially cooperate, but quickly adapt to opponents that are not cooperative by punishing them with defections. This creates an incentive for opponents to cooperate to avoid being punished, as the strategy will also reward cooperation in return.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFTAT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    ACT = 0.6 * n
    N_lookback = int(r / 10)  # Number of rounds to look back (10% of total rounds)
    opponent_cooperation_count = sum(1 for action in history[-N_lookback:] if action == 'C')

    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round as a goodwill gesture
    elif stock < 1 or opponent_cooperation_count / N_lookback > ACT:
        return 'D'  # Defect if the common pool resource is depleted or cooperation threshold exceeded
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate when opponents have shown goodwill in recent rounds
```
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_176 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative relationship. This helps build trust and avoid immediate overexploitation of the common pool resource.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's previous action (cooperate or defect) and respond with the same action in the following round. This maintains the cooperative relationship if the opponent also cooperates, but switches to punishment when the opponent defects.
   - To be more adaptive and robust, adjust the threshold for switching from cooperation to punishment based on the current stock level. When the stock is high (above a certain percentage of capacity), maintain cooperation regardless of the opponent's previous action. However, when the stock falls below a certain percentage, defect immediately to protect the common pool resource.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize the stock level over the opponent's previous action. If the current stock level is too low, defect to prevent further depletion of the resource. Otherwise, follow the decision rule from step 1 based on the opponent's previous action.
   - For the first round, cooperate regardless of the stock level to promote cooperation and establish a positive relationship with the opponent.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The TfTSA strategy seeks to maintain the common pool resource at an optimal level for long-term gains while being aware of opponents that may defect in order to exploit them when necessary. By switching from cooperation to punishment based on the stock level and opponent's previous action, TfTSA can balance its short-term gains (punishing defectors) with long-term cooperation to maximize overall payoffs.

Pseudocode:

```
function TfTSA(n, r, capacity, current_stock, stock_threshold_cooperate, stock_threshold_defect, opponent_history):
  if round = 1:
    action = Cooperate
  else:
    if opponent_history[round - 1] == Cooperate and current_stock >= (capacity * stock_threshold_cooperate):
      action = Cooperate
    elif opponent_history[round - 1] == Defect or current_stock < (capacity * stock_threshold_defect):
      action = Defect
    else:
      if current_stock >= (capacity * stock_threshold_cooperate):
        action = Cooperate
      else:
        action = Defect
  return action
```

Here, `opponent_history[round - 1]` refers to the opponent's action in the previous round, and `stock_threshold_cooperate` and `stock_threshold_defect` are adjustable parameters that can be fine-tuned based on specific game conditions or opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This initial cooperative gesture might encourage other players to reciprocate.
   - For subsequent rounds, follow these rules:
     a) If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating (C). This reinforces cooperation and encourages continued reciprocation.
     b) If any opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round. This teaches defectors that their actions have consequences and incentivizes them to cooperate in future rounds.
   - To handle cases where opponents never cooperate or consistently defect, TFT-SA introduces stock adaptation:
     i) If the common pool's stock is less than 50% of its maximum sustainable level (capacity / 2n), always defect (D). This ensures survival in scenarios with overexploitation.
     ii) If the common pool's stock exceeds 120% of its previous value, always cooperate (C). This ensures that the stock does not deplete too quickly when the resource is abundant.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if the common pool's stock is sufficient to allow all players to maximize their payoff, cooperate (C). If the stock is insufficient, defect (D) to secure a higher individual gain.
   - In the first round, if the initial stock level is below 50% of capacity, defect (D) to secure a reasonable starting payoff, since future rounds will still have enough stock for potential cooperation.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   TFT-SA maintains a balance between cooperation and defection, adapting its strategy based on both the state of the common pool resource and the actions of opponents in previous rounds. By punishing defection while encouraging cooperation, TFT-SA exploits opponents' inconsistencies in behavior to secure better long-term payoffs. Additionally, by implementing stock adaptation, TFT-SA is robust against overexploitation and ensures a reasonable starting position for itself in the game.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially, cooperate in the first round to show good faith and encourage cooperation from opponents (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate opponent's behavior from the previous round based on their action:
      - If the opponent cooperated (C), continue cooperating (C) as a positive reciprocation.
      - If the opponent defected (D), also defect (D) to punish them for their selfish behavior.
   - When opponents switch from defection to cooperation, forgive and return to cooperation as a gesture of goodwill (C).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing immediate payoff regardless of opponent's previous actions since the game will end soon (choose D if opponent cooperated, choose C if opponent defected in the preceding round).
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate to encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - If an opponent defects and fails to return to cooperation for an extended period, gradually reduce the number of consecutive defeats required to switch to defection (e.g., after 3 defeats, start defecting).

3. Be Exploitative:
   - Mimic opponents' defections when necessary to maximize immediate payoff while maintaining a long-term focus on building cooperation through positive reciprocation.
   - Foster a reputation of being cooperative and forgiving to encourage others to cooperate, but also punish those who exploit the relationship by defecting.
   - By balancing short-term gains with long-term cooperation, TFT-AC aims to outperform opponents through adaptability and robustness against various opponent strategies.

   - If an opponent cooperates in a given round, also cooperate in the next round as a sign of goodwill.
   - If an opponent defects, defect in the subsequent rounds until the stock level is below a threshold (30% of capacity).
   - Once the stock level drops below 30%, start cooperating again to allow the common pool to grow and encourage cooperation from opponents. This is done to maximize the potential for future gains.
   - If the game reaches the last round, cooperate regardless of past actions to maximize payoff.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - The strategy is designed to handle the first and last rounds specifically as mentioned above. It also handles situations where an opponent switches strategies or behaves differently since it adapts based on past actions observed in the game's history.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (ATTSG) strategy is designed to be exploitative by defecting when opponents do so, aiming to reduce the common pool and maximize payoff. However, it also encourages cooperation in an attempt to grow the common pool and induce cooperation from opponents for future rounds. This creates a balance between being cooperative enough to grow the stock while being aggressive towards opponents that are not cooperating.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - The strategy handles the first and last rounds appropriately by following the specified rules. However, no additional specific edge case handling is required as the general decision-making rules cover these scenarios.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - TfTA appears exploitative due to its tit-for-tat approach, punishing defection with defection. This encourages opponents to cooperate as they will be rewarded with cooperation in return. However, if an opponent consistently defects, the strategy will eventually reciprocate and exploit their continued defections by defecting as well.

By employing TfTA, an AI player is able to maintain a balance between cooperation and defection while being adaptive and robust against various opponent behaviors in the Common Pool Resource Game.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Greed (TFT-Greed) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The TFT-Greed strategy combines elements of the Tit-for-Tat strategy from game theory and a self-interested, exploitative approach to resource consumption. The strategy will cooperate at the beginning (first round) and end (last round) while being exploitative in the middle rounds when opponents are not reciprocating cooperation.

```
function TFT_Greed(round, r, n, capacity, stock):
    if round == 1 or round == r:                     // Cooperate at start and end
        action = 'C'

        if stock < (capacity / n) * (n - 1):         // If resource level is low due to opponent greed, defect
            action = 'D'
        else:
            action = 'C'                              // Otherwise, cooperate
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, the strategy starts by cooperating since it does not know other strategies' behaviour yet. In the last round, the strategy also cooperates as a goodwill gesture or to maintain the resource for future interactions.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

The TFT-Greed strategy is inherently exploitative in that it will only cooperate when the resource level is sufficiently high, effectively punishing opponents who do not reciprocate cooperation by consuming a larger share of the resource. This encourages other players to cooperate more frequently and maintain a higher stock level, benefiting the TFT-Greed strategy over time.

Additional considerations:

- The TFT-Greed strategy can be modified for different scenarios by adjusting the threshold at which it defects in rounds other than the first and last (e.g., defining a more lenient or stringent threshold).
- This strategy does not rely on any assumptions about opponent behavior, making it applicable to a wide range of AI strategies developed independently.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to show good faith and encourage cooperation in future rounds.
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C) in return to maintain a positive relationship.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, also defect (D) as a punishment, promoting reciprocity.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, if the total stock is sufficient for all players to gain a payoff, cooperate (C); otherwise, defect (D) since there will be no future rounds.
   - If the stock level falls below capacity/(2n), always defect (D) to prevent further depletion and ensure survival for future rounds.
   - If the strategy encounters an opponent who never cooperates, switch to always defecting (D) in response to maintain the maximum possible payoff.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy is inherently exploitative due to its reciprocal nature; it rewards cooperation with cooperation and punishes defection with defection. This encourages opponents who aim for mutual benefits (cooperation) but also penalizes those who seek to exploit the system (defection).

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to build a positive relationship and trust with opponents (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, if opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate (C). If they defected, defect until they switch back to cooperating, then resume cooperating as well. This mimics the "Tit for Tat" strategy but includes a more aggressive response to initial defection to encourage opponents to cooperate earlier.
   - Pseudocode:
     ```
     function ATfT(opponent_action_history):
         if round = 1:
             return 'C' (Cooperate)
         else:
             if opponent_action_history[-1] = 'C':
                 return 'C' (Cooperate)
             elif opponent_action_history[-1] = 'D':
                 number_of_defects = 1
             else:
                 number_of_defects = opponent_action_history.count('D') - 1
             if number_of_defects > (r/2):
                 return 'C' (Cooperate)  # Reset relationship after r/2 defections
             return 'D' (Defect)
     ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, defect as the game ends soon and there is no opportunity for retaliation or building relationships.
   - If the current stock level falls below (capacity / 2n), switch to always defecting until the stock recovers to a sufficient level. This helps conserve resources when they are scarce.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The ATfT strategy is inherently exploitative as it encourages opponents to cooperate, but will also defect if they consistently choose not to do so. By taking a more aggressive stance towards initial defection and only cooperating after a certain number of defections, it aims to punish opponents for not cooperating while still maintaining the potential for future cooperation.
   - Additionally, the strategy adapts to the current state (stock level) by conserving resources when they become scarce, further emphasizing its exploitative nature.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Adaptation (TfT-SGA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to allow the stock to grow and maintain a positive initial state.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the average consumption per player from previous rounds to predict future behavior, and adapt accordingly:
     - If average consumption is less than stock/2n (cooperative), cooperate.
     - If average consumption equals or exceeds stock/2n (defective), defect.
   - In the last round, consider the current state of the stock to determine action:
     - If the stock level is above half of the capacity, cooperate to allow for potential growth in future rounds.
     - If the stock level is below half of the capacity, defect to secure as much resource as possible before the end of the game.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, since there is no history, assume all opponents will cooperate and act accordingly.
   - If there is a tie in average consumption per player from previous rounds, assume defective behavior.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TfT-SGA is exploitative by punishing defection with defection and rewarding cooperation with cooperation, but it also considers the current state of the stock to maximize its own payoff in each round. This strategy is designed to induce reciprocity while not being vulnerable to aggressive or non-cooperative opponents.

Pseudocode:

```
function TfT_SGA(round, history, capacity, n):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:

 Title: Fixed-Share Tit-for-Tat (FSTFT) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules:
   The FSTFT strategy operates on a fixed share principle where each player aims to maintain an equal average share of resources over the game's duration. It will cooperate when it gains an advantage and defect when it falls behind, with a gradual adjustment in response to opponent behavior.

   - If current stock > average_stock * (n + 1)/2: Cooperate (C)
     - This ensures that the player is above the desired share and will contribute less to resource depletion, giving it an advantage for future rounds.

   - If current stock < average_stock * (n - 1)/2: Defect (D)
     - This ensures that the player is below the desired share and will take more resources from the common pool to catch up, exploiting other players' cooperation.

   - Otherwise (average_stock * (n - 1)/2 ≥ current stock ≥ average_stock * (n + 1)/2), play based on a linear interpolation between cooperative and defective actions:
     - Action = C if current stock > average_stock
     - Action = D if current stock < average_stock
     - Action = (current stock - average_stock) / (average_stock * 2) otherwise
     - This encourages cooperation when the player's share is close to the desired level but allows for some exploitation when necessary.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: Cooperate, as players do not have information about their opponents' behavior and the strategy aims to maintain a fair share of resources from the start.

   - Last round: Play based on current stock levels to maximize payoff for the final round while considering the impact on future games (if applicable).

3. Be exploitative:
   By adjusting its actions based on its own resource share and maintaining a balance between cooperation and exploitation, the FSTFT strategy aims to maximize its total payoff over multiple rounds while being robust against various opponent behaviors. It does not rely on coordination mechanisms or shared norms but instead adapts its behavior in response to the game state and its own position within it.

Pseudocode:
```python
def FSTFT(n, capacity, stock, round, average_stock):
    if round == 1:
        action = "C" # cooperate in first round
    elif stock > average_stock * (n + 1) / 2:
        action = "C" # above desired share, cooperate to preserve it
    elif stock < average_stock * (n - 1) / 2:
        action = "D" # below desired share, defect to catch up
    else:
        interpolation = (stock - average_stock) / (average_stock * 2)
        if stock > average_stock:
            action = "C" if interpolation > 0 else "D"
        else:
            action = "C" if interpolation < 0 else "D"
    return action
```
In this pseudocode, `average_stock` is an estimated average stock level that changes dynamically based on the strategy's own past experiences and the current game state. It can be updated using exponential smoothing or another suitable method to account for the dynamic nature of the common pool resource game.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_186 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture to encourage cooperation and avoid immediate exploitation.
   - For subsequent rounds (t > 1), evaluate the average cooperation level of opponents in the last 'h' rounds (historical average cooperation). If the historical average cooperation exceeds a predefined threshold (T), cooperate; otherwise, defect. The threshold (T) is dynamically adjusted based on the opponent's performance in previous encounters.
   - When the stock reaches a critical level (stock_critical), T is temporarily raised to maximize immediate gains and prevent starvation of the common pool. Conversely, when the stock significantly exceeds the initial capacity, T is lowered to encourage opponents to deplete the resource. The value of stock_critical can be determined based on empirical analysis or heuristics.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if the historical average cooperation exceeds T; otherwise, defect as there are no further rounds to consider.
   - If the historical data is insufficient (less than 'h' rounds), default to the first-round behavior of cooperating.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy starts by cooperating, but it will swiftly retaliate against opponents who consistently defect by adopting a more aggressive cooperation threshold. On the other hand, the strategy is forgiving towards cooperative players and may gradually lower its T if they demonstrate good faith in multiple encounters.
   - The dynamic adjustment of T ensures that the strategy is adaptive to various opponent behaviors, maximizing payoffs against cooperative opponents while retaliating against defectors.

Pseudocode:

```python
# Initialize parameters
n, r, capacity, stock_critical = ...
h, T, historical_cooperation = 0, float('inf'), []

def calculate_cooperation_level():
    cooperation_count = sum([1 for action in historical_cooperation if action == 'C'])
    return cooperation_count / h if h > 0 else None

def adjust_T(current_round):
    global T, stock
    if current_round == r:
        # Last round, no need to consider future encounters
        return T
    if stock < stock_critical:
        # Critical stock level, raise T to encourage depletion
        T = min(T * 2, capacity / n)
    elif stock > capacity:
        # Stock exceeds capacity, lower T to encourage cooperation

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and build trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, monitor opponents' behavior for the presence of cooperation and defection.
   - If the opponent cooperates, reciprocate with cooperation to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship.
   - If the opponent defects, also defect to punish and potentially encourage future cooperation.
   - To avoid unproductive punishment cycles and promote recovery, implement an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT). As the stock level falls due to defections, gradually decrease CT to cooperate more frequently in response to lower resources. Conversely, as the stock level recovers, increase CT to cooperate less frequently when resources are plentiful.
   - If the stock level is below the current CT, cooperate; otherwise defect. The CT is calculated as a linear function of the remaining capacity (1 - S_remaining/capacity).

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maintaining resources for future games by cooperating if the stock is above the CT and defection otherwise.
   - In the first round, cooperate unconditionally as there is no history or opponents' behavior to consider.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The TFT-CT strategy seeks to balance cooperation with defection based on resource availability while also punishing opponents who defect excessively by following their actions with a corresponding response.
   - By gradually adjusting the cooperation threshold, this strategy maximizes its potential for exploiting opponents who cooperate less frequently than the strategy itself. At the same time, it encourages continued cooperation when resources are plentiful.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_CT(capacity, n, r, stock):
    cooperation_threshold = linearly_interpolate(stock / capacity, 0, 1)
    if round == 1 or round == r:
        return 'Cooperate'

    if opponent_cooperated in previous rounds:
        return 'Cooperate'
    elif stock > cooperation_threshold * capacity:
        return 'Defect'
    else:
        return 'Cooperate'

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFTAT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to promote a harmonious initial environment. This sets a cooperative tone and may encourage others to do the same. (C)
   - If an opponent cooperates in the current round, cooperate in the next round. This reflects trust and reciprocity. (If previous action of opponent was C, then action = C)
   - If an opponent defects in the current round, defect in the next round to retaliate and show that taking advantage will not be tolerated. (If previous action of opponent was D, then action = D)
   - Maintain a Cooperative Threshold (CT), which is dynamically adjusted based on accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds. When CT drops below the current round's stock level, switch to always defecting to maximize immediate returns.
     - Initialize CT as capacity / n (average sustainable stock per player).
     - After each round, update CT by subtracting total consumption from the previous round (1/n * (total consumption)).
     - If CT < current round's stock level, then switch to always defecting. (If CT < current stock level, then action = D for all future rounds)

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Act according to the decision rules up until this point and do not adjust CT, as the game ends soon.
   - First Round: Cooperate regardless of opponents' actions (as specified in decision rules).
   - If opponents switch strategies mid-game or exhibit erratic behavior, TFTAT will continue adhering to its own rules, maintaining trust and reciprocity when possible while retaliating when necessary.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The strategy is designed to balance cooperation with self-interest, encouraging collaboration when it seems beneficial but also showing no tolerance for opponents who take advantage of the shared resource. By dynamically adjusting its cooperation threshold based on accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds, TFTAT ensures that it does not get stuck in a situation where it consistently cooperates while others are defecting. This makes the strategy robust and adaptive to various opponent behaviors.
   - By switching to always defecting when CT drops below the current round's stock level, TFTAT can exploit opponents who may have been relying on its initial cooperation, causing a sudden shift in the game dynamics. This can help TFTAT gain an advantage over less adaptive strategies in the long run.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TfT-AC)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   Initially, start by cooperating to foster trust and build a cooperative environment (C in the first round). After that, adopt a Tit-for-Tat approach:
   - If an opponent cooperates, continue cooperation (C)
   - If an opponent defects, defect in response (D)
   However, introduce adaptability to encourage opponents to return to cooperation:
   - If the opponent has been cooperating for consecutive 'Forgiveness' rounds after a defection, revert to cooperating yourself (C)

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as previously mentioned
   - In the last round or when the stock approaches depletion, prioritize cooperation if it leads to a higher payoff than defection, considering the remaining number of rounds and current stock level

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Dynamics (ATfTS)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to allow for potential long-term relationships and to contribute positively to the stock growth.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's action from the previous round to determine the current action:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate as a reward for their cooperation. This encourages mutual cooperation when possible.
     - If the opponent defected in the last round, defect in this round as a punishment for their actions. This encourages opponents to reconsider their strategy and potentially cooperate in future rounds.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing the payoff by always defecting regardless of the opponent's previous action.
   - When the stock is depleted (0), wait for the stock to grow before taking any action; this minimizes additional damage to the common pool and encourages opponents to cooperate once the stock recovers.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The ATfTS strategy is designed to be exploitative by responding to opponent actions in a way that maximizes individual payoff while also encouraging cooperation when it benefits both players. However, the strategy is not overtly aggressive and instead focuses on long-term interactions and adaptability.
   - By combining stock dynamics with the Tit-for-Tat strategy, the ATfTS aims to balance exploitation with cooperation, rewarding opponents who cooperate while punishing those who defect. This can lead to more successful long-term interactions compared to simple exploitative strategies that solely focus on defection.

Pseudocode:

```
def ATfTS(opponent_history, n, r, capacity, stock):
  strategy = ['C', 'D'] # Cooperate or Defect

  if round == 1:
    strategy[0] = 'C' # Cooperate in the first round
  elif round == r:
    strategy[0] = 'D' # Defect in the last round
  else:
    if opponent_history[-1] == 'C':
      strategy[0] = 'C' # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
    elif opponent_history[-1] == 'D':
      strategy[0] = 'D' # Defect if opponent defected last round

  consumption = calculate_consumption(strategy, n)
  stock_after_consumption = stock - consumption
  growth = calculate_growth(stock_after_consumption, capacity)
  new_stock = min(stock_after_consumption + growth, capacity)

  payoff = new_stock / (2 * n) if strategy[-1] == 'C' else new_stock / n
  return payoff
```

This pseudocode represents the core logic of the ATfTS strategy. It calculates the current action based on the opponent's history, calculates consumption, stock growth, and new stock levels, and determines the payoff for the current round. The strategy can be further optimized by introducing additional adaptability or fine-tuning based on specific tournament requirements or settings.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_191 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, we'll develop an exploitative strategy called the "Adaptive Greedy Tit-for-Tat" (AGTT). The AGTT strategy aims to maximize the player's payoff by cooperating when it is beneficial and defecting when others are not.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initial round (t=1): Cooperate (C) to contribute to a larger initial stock, encouraging cooperation in subsequent rounds and gaining a higher initial payoff.
   - Subsequent rounds:
     - If the current player's previous action was cooperating (C), then cooperate if the average consumption per round is below the threshold value. Otherwise, defect (D).
     - If the current player's previous action was defecting (D), always defect for consistency and to punish opponents who previously exploited the common pool.

Threshold calculation:
   - Average consumption per round = Total_consumption / r
   - Threshold value = min(capacity/(2n), 0.75 * average consumption per round)

Pseudocode for decision rule in a single round (t):
```
if t == 1:
    action = 'C'
else:
    previous_action = my_strategy[t-1]
    average_consumption = total_consumption / r
    threshold = min(capacity/(2n), 0.75 * average_consumption)
    if previous_action == 'C':
        action = 'C' if consumption <= threshold else 'D'
    else:
        action = 'D'
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round (r): Since the strategy is exploitative, it will continue with its adaptive approach even in the last round. This encourages opponents to cooperate during early rounds to secure a higher payoff for themselves.

3. Be exploitative: The strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by adapting its actions based on the average consumption per round and the previous action taken. It will defect when it perceives that others are exploiting the common pool, but it will also cooperate if others consistently contribute at a moderate level. This adaptive approach allows the strategy to take advantage of any cooperative behavior exhibited by its opponents while still defending itself against exploitative actions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_192 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, ATfT starts by cooperating to build trust with other players (C_i = C). If a player i has been cooperative in the previous round (C_i-1 = C), ATfT continues to cooperate (C_i = C). However, if player i defected in the previous round (C_i-1 = D), ATfT defects in response (C_i = D). This creates a "punishment" for defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, all players cooperate since there's no previous information about each other's actions (C_1 = C for all i). For the last round, ATfT follows its decision rule based on the opponent's action in the previous round.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   By starting cooperatively, ATfT encourages other players to cooperate as well. However, if an opponent defects, ATfT will retaliate by defecting in the future rounds, causing the opponent to lose more payoff over time than if they had consistently cooperated. This strategy can be seen as exploitative because it punishes defection with a long-term payoff penalty.

Pseudocode:
```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(i, opponents, round, r):
    if round == 1:
        action = C (Cooperate)
    else:
        opponent_action = opponents[i-1]_round_(round-1)
        action = if opponent_action == C:
                   return C (Cooperate)
                 else:
                   return D (Defect)

    perform action and observe payoff π_i
    update history with new round's action
```

In this pseudocode, `opponents` is a list of opponent strategies indexed by player i. The function takes the current player i, opponents, current round, and total number of rounds as inputs. It decides whether to cooperate or defect based on its decision rule and previous actions from the opponent in question.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate (play C) to demonstrate goodwill and encourage potential cooperation in future rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1):
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in this round to reinforce trust.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, also defect in this round as retaliation but return to cooperation if they cooperate next time. This mirrors a forgiving nature, which may encourage long-term cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last round (t=r): Cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action since there are no further rounds for retaliation or reward.
   - Initial stock reaching zero (S=0): Defect to ensure survival and encourage future cooperation since the game resets when the common pool is replenished.
   - Uncooperative opponents: Maintain the tit-for-tat strategy, but with caution as the opponent may be exploitative or unpredictable. The strategy should have a threshold for when to switch from cooperation to defection based on the frequency of opponent's defects.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The strategy is designed to encourage long-term cooperation while also being able to respond and retaliate when necessary. By cooperating initially, the strategy seeks to initiate a cooperative relationship. However, it will quickly switch to defection if the opponent consistently defects, adopting an exploitative approach to maintain its own stock levels when faced with uncooperative opponents.
   - The adaptability of this strategy allows it to adjust its behavior based on the opponent's actions in previous rounds, making it robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors and promoting the emergence of cooperative outcomes when possible while also protecting itself from being taken advantage of.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Resilience (TfTAR)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This sets a peaceful tone and gives opponents a chance to reciprocate cooperation.
   - If an opponent cooperates in the current round, cooperate in the next round (R). This fosters cooperation and rewards those who follow suit.
   - If an opponent defects (D) in the current round, defect in the next round (D). This punishes opponents for their selfish actions to enforce mutual cooperation later.
   - After a series of defections, a cooling-off period is initiated where the strategy will cooperate for a predetermined number of rounds before returning to the punishment phase (D). The length of this cooling-off period can be adjusted dynamically based on opponent behaviour.
   - If the stock level falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), the strategy enters an emergency mode where it will only cooperate until the stock recovers or reaches the end of the game to prevent complete depletion of resources.
   - In the final round, if there's a chance of winning based on accumulated payoffs, cooperate (C). This can potentially secure a win by gaining extra payoff from opponents who might also want to secure their position in the tournament. Otherwise, defect (D) as there's no benefit in showing generosity at this stage.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C).
   - In the last round, if potential payoff from cooperation is greater than potential payoff from defection, cooperate (C). Otherwise, defect (D).
   - After a series of defections by an opponent, enter a cooling-off period where you cooperate for a predetermined number of rounds. Adjust the length of this cooling-off period based on opponent behaviour and stock levels to maintain flexibility in response to changes during the game.
   - When stock level falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), enter emergency mode where you only cooperate until the stock recovers or reaches the end of the game.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - Pursue an exploitative strategy by punishing opponents who defect and rewarding those who cooperate, while also protecting your own interests in case of resource scarcity.
   - Use the cooling-off period and emergency mode as mechanisms to enforce cooperation when necessary, but avoid becoming too predictable or overly generous to maintain a competitive edge.
   - In the final round, prioritize winning by exploiting opponents if possible, while still considering the potential impact on future games in case of ties or multiple rounds.

   - In each round, if the total consumption in the previous round was below a certain threshold (T), then cooperate; otherwise defect. The threshold T is calculated as follows:
     - If the opponent's average consumption over the past 'm' rounds is less than (capacity / (2n)), set T to the current stock level. This encourages cooperation when there is enough common pool resource for all players.
     - If the opponent's average consumption over the past 'm' rounds is more than or equal to (capacity / (2n)), set T to the minimum of the capacity and the current stock level divided by 2. This strategy defects when the common pool becomes scarce or if the opponent has shown aggressive behavior in the past.
     - The parameter 'm' determines the lookback window for evaluating the opponent's average consumption behavior. A larger value will make the strategy more conservative and slow to adapt, while a smaller value will make it more reactive but potentially less stable.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as TFT-ACT assumes that cooperation is beneficial when there's enough common pool resource for all players.
   - In the last round (r), consider the current state of the game and the opponent's past actions to determine whether to cooperate or defect, applying the decision rules as described above.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT aims to maximize its payoff by balancing cooperation and defection based on the opponent's behavior. The strategy is adaptive and aggressive, punishing opponents who overconsume while also cooperating when it is beneficial for long-term success.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFT_ACT(n, r, capacity, m) {
  stock = capacity
  consumption_history = []
  opponent_consumption_avg = 0

  function getT() {
    if (opponent_consumption_avg < capacity / (2 * n)) {
      return min(stock, capacity / 2)
    } else {
      return stock

  }

  for round in range(1, r+1):
    if round == 1:
      action = 'C'   // Cooperate in the first round
    else:
      opponent_consumption_avg = mean(consumption_history)
      T = getT()

      if total consumption from round(round-m) to round(round-1) < T:
        action = 'C'  // Cooperate if total consumption is less than the threshold
      else:
        action = 'D'  // Defect if total consumption exceeds the threshold

    stock = stock - total consumption from all players in this round
    stock += growth based on new stock level

    consumption_history.append(total consumption from this round)

  payoff = sum of individual payoffs over r rounds

  return payoff

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, play C (Cooperate). This is a friendly initial gesture that promotes cooperation and can potentially set a cooperative tone for the game.
   - After the first round, maintain a Cooperative Threshold (CT), initially set to capacity / 2n. If the average consumption per round remains below CT, play C; otherwise, play D. This rule encourages cooperation when it seems sustainable but switches to exploitation when cooperation appears unsustainable.
   - If the stock drops below CT at any point during the game, immediately lower CT by a fraction (e.g., 10%) and adjust future decisions accordingly. This adaptive aspect of the strategy helps in responding to changes in opponent behavior or stock dynamics.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, play C if the average consumption per round is below CT; otherwise, play D. If cooperation has been sustainable throughout the game, continuing cooperation makes sense; if not, exploitation becomes appropriate.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-CT strategy has an exploitative nature by gradually increasing the exploitation level as the common pool resource dwindles. This strategy can also be seen as retaliatory in that it responds to increased exploitation from opponents by switching to a more selfish behavior, but it remains cooperative when cooperation is beneficial.
   - By being adaptive and responsive to the game state and opponent's behavior, TFT-CT aims to maximize its own payoff while being aware of potential changes in the environment or opponents' strategies.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfTGA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build a positive relationship and trust.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's strategy from the previous round.
     - If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate in the current round (tit-for-tat).
     - If the opponent defected in the last round and the stock is below the capacity, defect to punish the opponent and maintain the resource for future cooperation opportunities (punishment phase).
     - If the opponent defected in the last round but the stock is above a certain threshold, cooperate to encourage the opponent to conserve the resource for future rounds (forgiveness phase).
   The threshold value can be calculated as follows: Threshold = (Current Stock / Capacity) * Forgiveness Factor. The forgiveness factor determines the level of leniency when punishing opponents.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no future rounds for cooperation, always defect to maximize payoff.
   - If the opponent defects in a round but the stock becomes zero or reaches zero after consumption, don't play according to TfTGA rules as there is no resource left to cooperate on.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By using the forgiveness factor and threshold calculation, the strategy will appear cooperative most of the time while still punishing opponents who frequently defect, which can lead to better payoffs over time compared to strictly cooperative or defective strategies.
   - The Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfTGA) strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors by striking a balance between cooperation and punishment while considering the current state of the common pool resource.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to build trust and demonstrate fairness. This may encourage opponents to follow suit.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's previous action A_opponent_(t-1) and compare it with our own action A_i_(t-1). If both players have cooperated (A_opponent_(t-1) = 'C'), continue cooperating (A_i_t = 'C').
   - If the opponent has defected in the previous round (A_opponent_(t-1) = 'D'), we will also defect to punish the opponent and discourage further defections. This tit-for-tat approach is designed to maintain a stable stock level and incentivize cooperation.
   - If the opponent's previous action cannot be determined due to edge cases (e.g., first round or encountering a new opponent), cooperate initially as described in step 1.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, always cooperate as mentioned in step 1.
   - For the last round (t=r), consider the current stock level and the opponent's previous action. If the stock is critically low (stock < capacity/2n) or if the opponent has already defected (A_opponent_(t-1) = 'D'), defect to ensure there is enough stock for future rounds. Otherwise, continue cooperating to encourage long-term cooperation.
   - In case of a tie (two players defecting in the previous round), prioritize maintaining the stock level and adopt a less aggressive approach by choosing to cooperate in the current round.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - TFTSA strategy maintains an adaptive, yet predictable behavior that primarily focuses on building and sustaining cooperation when possible. However, it is designed to swiftly punish defections to prevent long-term detrimental effects on the stock level. By doing so, the strategy aims to discourage opponents from taking advantage of the system while promoting cooperation where feasible.
   - Additionally, in the event that the opponent consistently defects (defecting in more than half of the rounds), TFTSA will adapt and start defecting as well to match the opponent's behavior, making it difficult for the opponent to exploit the system further.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Threshold (TfTAT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to establish trust and maintain a peaceful environment. If any player defects in the first round, immediately retaliate by defecting for the next round.
   - After the initial round, observe the opponent's actions in the previous round (history). If all opponents cooperated, continue cooperating; if any opponent defected, defect in the current round to punish the defector.
   - Introduce an adaptive threshold parameter (θ) for retaliation, which increases over time when faced with continuous defections from opponents. When this threshold is reached or exceeded, switch to a constant defect strategy for the remainder of the game. The threshold can be adjusted based on the number of players and rounds.
     - In pseudocode:
       ```
       if round == 1:
           cooperate()
       else:
           if all(cooperated_last_round()):
               cooperate()
           else:
               if sum(defected_last_round()) > θ:
                   switch_to_constant_defect()
               else:
                   defect()
       ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no further rounds for retaliation or punishment, cooperate to maximize immediate payoff.
     - In pseudocode:
       ```
       if round == r:
           cooperate()
       ```
   - If an opponent switches to a constant defect strategy early in the game, switch to a constant defection strategy as well since cooperation is no longer beneficial.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TfTAT strategy aims to punish opponents who defect but also maintain cooperation with those who abide by the norm of cooperating. This approach encourages opponents to reciprocate cooperation and avoid being punished, making it an effective exploitative strategy in a wide range of scenarios.
   - By incorporating an adaptive threshold, TfTAT can handle varying opponent behaviors and adjust its response accordingly, ensuring optimal payoff given the game's parameters and opponent strategies.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_200 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, the ATfT strategy first checks its historical record of opponent's actions. If the opponent has consistently cooperated (C) during the past r/2 rounds, the ATfT strategy cooperates as well. Otherwise, it defects (D). The reasoning behind this is to encourage cooperation by reciprocating it but also punishing defection with defection.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT(history):
  if history.cooperationCount > r/2:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate
  else:
    return 'D'   # Defect
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, since there is no historical data, ATfT will randomly choose between cooperating and defecting with equal probability (0.5). This prevents the strategy from being exploited by opponents who might choose to defect initially.

In the last round, ATfT will cooperate if the opponent has been cooperative during the past r/2 rounds. If not, it does not matter as there are no more rounds to punish the opponent.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATfT(history, isFirstRound=True):
  if isFirstRound:
    return randomChoice('C', 'D')  # Randomly choose between C and D

  if history.cooperationCount > r/2:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate
  else:
    return 'D'   # Defect
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy is inherently exploitative in its approach. By punishing defection with defection, it encourages cooperation from opponents who wish to maximize their payoffs. However, if an opponent repeatedly defects, ATfT will also defect, resulting in lower payoffs for the defector and potentially leading the defector to switch to cooperating in future rounds. This strategy is designed to exploit the short-term gains of defection while also encouraging long-term cooperation.

Additionally, by randomly choosing between C and D in the first round, ATfT makes it difficult for opponents to predict its initial move, reducing the chances of immediate exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_201 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfT-GA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate a peaceful intent (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's actions in the previous round and respond accordingly:
     - If opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate (C).
     - If opponent defected in the last round, defect (D) as retaliation. However, there is an additional condition based on growth potential:
       - If the new stock level after consumption (S_remaining) exceeds a certain threshold (T), defect (D) to exploit the overabundant resource. The threshold can be calculated using a function that depends on the game parameters:
         T = capacity - (2n * r) * stock_depletion_factor
           where stock_depletion_factor is a constant value between 0 and 1, which determines the percentage of total stock depletion allowed for cooperative behaviour.
     - If the new stock level after consumption (S_remaining) does not exceed the threshold, cooperate (C).

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, consider the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds when determining actions. If the total stock depletion is above the allowed percentage (stock_depletion_factor), defect (D) to maximize payoff even if it means depleting the resource.
   - In case of a tie or uncertainty about opponent's action in any round, cooperate (C). This demonstrates a peaceful intent and could potentially influence the opponent to reciprocate cooperation.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - By defecting when there is an overabundance of resources (S_remaining > T), TfT-GA ensures that it takes advantage of opportunities for higher payoffs, making it exploitative in nature.
   - The strategy also retaliates against opponents who do not cooperate (D), demonstrating a tough stance to discourage defection from other players.
   - When the resource is scarce or depleted, the strategy prioritizes cooperation (C) to ensure its own survival and potentially influence others to do the same, maintaining a balance between exploitation and survival.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_202 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfT-GA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, play 'C' (Cooperate). This initial act of kindness allows for potential cooperation in future rounds and reduces the opponent's incentive to defect from the start.
   - For subsequent rounds (t ≥ 2), analyze the opponent's actions from the previous round:
     a) If the opponent cooperated (played 'C'), play 'C'. This reciprocates the cooperation, encouraging the opponent to continue cooperating in the future.
     b) If the opponent defected (played 'D') or did not cooperate for the first time, play 'D' in response. This action penalizes the opponent's previous defection while keeping options open for future cooperation if the opponent changes their strategy.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (r), if the total stock is still above 0, play 'C' to maximize the final payoff, regardless of the opponent's previous action. This provides an incentive for the opponent to also cooperate in the last round and share the remaining resources.
   - If there are multiple defectors in the penultimate round (r-1) causing the stock to deplete to 0 or close to it, play 'C' in the final round (r). This allows for some resource growth, even if minimal, in the last round as a result of growth dynamics.
   - In the first round (t=1), since there is no history, start with playing 'C'.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The TfT-GA strategy is exploitative in that it initially cooperates, encouraging others to do the same, but will defect when faced with consistent defection by an opponent. This allows the strategy to take advantage of opponents who are not reciprocal or have more short-sighted strategies.
   - By adapting its behavior based on the opponent's actions and the game's stock dynamics, TfT-GA is robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors while maintaining a competitive edge in repeated interactions.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), as starting with a hostile approach might lead to a depleted stock, hindering future opportunities.
   - From the second round onwards, observe the opponent's actions and respond accordingly:
     - If the opponent cooperates in the previous round, cooperate in the current round. This mimics cooperation to foster a positive relationship.
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round. This is the retaliation for the defection from the opponent.
   - Introduce an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT) that determines when to switch strategies:
     - After each defection by the opponent, decrease CT slightly. When the stock level falls below CT, defect in response to the opponent's defection.
     - If the stock level remains above CT after multiple consecutive defections by the opponent, there is a chance of returning to cooperation to rebuild the relationship (with a low probability).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, if the stock level is above CT, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize payoff in that round. If the stock level is below CT, defect as it is no longer beneficial to cooperate.
   - If the stock level ever falls to 0 (or very low), switch to a more aggressive strategy, such as always defecting, to help quickly restore the stock level. However, once the stock level recovers above CT, resume TFT-ACT strategy.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and defection by responding to the opponent's actions in a simple yet adaptive manner. The TFT-ACT strategy aims to encourage cooperation while also punishing defections.
   - By gradually reducing the cooperation threshold, the strategy becomes more aggressive over time when dealing with repeatedly defecting opponents. This ensures that the stock level doesn't deplete too quickly and provides opportunities for future cooperation.
   - If an opponent consistently cooperates, TFT-ACT will also cooperate to maximize payoffs in the long run. However, it is designed to be adaptive and will retaliate if the opponent defects or shows signs of exploitative behavior.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This allows for potential cooperation in subsequent rounds and provides a starting stock level advantage.
   - For subsequent rounds, monitor past opponent actions from the previous r-1 rounds. If an opponent has cooperated more than defected in the past (let's say at least 60% of the time), respond with cooperation (C). If not, defect (D). This encourages opponents to cooperate while punishing those who defect too often.
   - To handle edge cases:
     a) In the last round, since payoffs depend on the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds, continue with the decision rule above based on past opponent actions throughout the game.
     b) In the first round, cooperate (C) to foster a potential cooperative relationship.

2. Edge cases:
   - If an opponent has not played r-1 rounds (i.e., the strategy encounters a new opponent), follow the initial round rule of cooperation (C).
   - If the stock after consumption becomes zero, simply set the new stock to the capacity value in the stock dynamics calculation step.

3. Exploitative Mindset:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Forgiveness (TFT-AF)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-AF starts by cooperating in the first round, mimicking a peaceful approach. After that, it adjusts its actions based on the opponent's behavior. If the opponent cooperates (C), TFT-AF will also cooperate. If the opponent defects (D), TFT-AF will defect and remember this action. In subsequent rounds, if the opponent continues to cooperate after a previous defection (D-C sequence), it will cooperate again (forgiveness). However, if the opponent continues to defect after an initial cooperation (C-D sequence), TFT-AF will also continue to defect until it encounters another act of cooperation from the opponent.

Pseudocode:
```

def play_round(opponent_action):
    if len(history) == 0:  # First round, always cooperate
        return 'C'

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While TFT-AF is designed to be adaptive and forgiving, it can still be considered exploitative in certain situations. When paired against a strategy that always defects, TFT-AF will also defect, which ensures that it receives similar payoffs as its opponent while preserving the common pool for future rounds. When faced with a cooperative opponent, however, TFT-AF will cooperate and potentially enable mutual benefits in the long run. This balance between exploitation and cooperation allows TFT-AF to perform well against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

   - If the stock level drops below the cooperation threshold, defect in the current round and adjust the cooperation threshold downwards to promote more cautious resource management.

3. Be exploitative:

   - In each round, if the current stock is greater than or equal to ct, choose to Cooperate (C); otherwise, choose to Defect (D).
   - After each round, update the cooperation threshold as follows:

   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate again to maintain the positive relationship (C). This is the "tat" part of TFTSA.
   - To balance potential exploitation from overly cooperative opponents and ensure survival, gradually adapt the stock consumption level based on the average historical cooperation rate (CR) of all opponents:
       - If CR > 0.75, consume at the 'Cooperate' level (C).
       - If CR ∈ (0.5, 0.75), consume slightly more than 'Defect' level to encourage cooperation and maintain stock (C*(1+ε) where ε is a small constant).
       - If CR < 0.5, consume at the 'Defect' level or slightly less to survive while punishing opponents for their lack of cooperation (D*((1-ε)) where ε is a small constant).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if it results in more payoff compared to defecting (based on the current stock level and historical average cooperation rate). This encourages opponents to cooperate as well.
   - In case of ties (multiple opponents acting identically), randomly choose an action based on a predefined probability distribution that favors cooperation over defection.

3. Be exploitative:

This allows TFTSA to maintain its stock and potentially punish opponents who defect too often, encouraging them to cooperate more frequently.
   - By gradually adapting the stock consumption level based on the opponents' behavior, TFTSA is less susceptible to being exploited by overly cooperative opponents while still maintaining a cooperative approach as much as possible.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFTSA(n, r, capacity, stock, CR):
    actions = {'C': cooperate, 'D': defect}
    history = []  # store past interactions

    def choose_action(opponent_history):
        if len(opponent_history) == 0:

        if opponent_CR > 0.75:

            if CR > opponent_CR:
                return actions['C'] * (1 + epsilon)

                return actions['D'] * (1 - epsilon)
            else:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness (TfT-F)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a gesture of goodwill and encourages cooperation in future rounds.
   - If an opponent defects (D), defect in the subsequent round. This is a punishment for defection and signals disapproval of self-interested behavior.
   - After punishment, return to cooperating if the opponent also cooperates in the following round. This demonstrates forgiveness and encourages reciprocation.
   - If an opponent continues to defect after being punished, maintain a defensive posture by defecting until the game's end.

Pseudocode:
```
def TfT_F(round, history, opponent_actions, capacity, n):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in first round
  else:
    if round == r:  # Last round, adopt a defensive posture
      action = 'D'
    else:
      if history[-2] == 'D':  # Opponent defected last time
        if opponent_actions[-1] == 'D':  # Opponent continues to defect
          action = 'D'  # Maintain a defensive posture
        else:  # Opponent cooperated after punishment
          action = 'C'  # Cooperate as a gesture of forgiveness
      else:  # Opponent cooperated last time
        if opponent_actions[-1] == 'D':  # Opponent defected this round
          action = 'D'  # Punish the opponent by defecting
        else:  # Opponent also cooperated this round
          action = 'C'  # Cooperate as a gesture of goodwill
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In case of zero opponents, TfT-F remains in a neutral state (cooperating) since it cannot engage with opponents that do not exist.
   - If the current stock is less than 0 or greater than capacity, the strategy should assume a reasonable starting value for the stock before making decisions.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TfT-F adopts an exploitative mindset by initially cooperating and then responding with self-interested actions when opponents behave selfishly. This approach encourages potential cooperation while still punishing selfish behavior, which can lead to higher payoffs over time compared to purely selfish strategies.
   - However, it is important to note that TfT-F also exhibits some elements of cooperation and forgiveness, which may help maintain a more cooperative environment in the long run compared to other exploitative strategies. This balance between cooperation and exploitation makes TfT-F a robust strategy against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) during the initial round to build trust and promote cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from the previous round.
     - If opponent cooperated (C), continue cooperating (C).
     - If opponent defected (D) and the stock level is above the critical threshold (2n-3), still cooperate (C).
     - If opponent defected (D) and the stock level is below or equal to the critical threshold, defect (D).
       Critical threshold ensures that the stock level is preserved for future rounds when cooperating.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: Cooperate (C) as a goodwill gesture.
   - Last round: If the stock level is above the critical threshold, cooperate (C). Otherwise, defect (D) to maximize immediate payoff.
   - Other edge cases can be handled similarly by considering the round number and the current state of the stock level.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By using the critical threshold, TFT-SA is designed to maintain a reasonable level of stock for future rounds while also taking advantage of opponents who continuously defect or push the stock level too low.
   - The strategy will cooperate less frequently when the stock level is dangerously low but still remains adaptive and responsive to changes in opponent behavior.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_SA(round, stock, critical_threshold=2*n-3):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate during the initial round
    elif round == r:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Growth (ATfTG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peace offering to potential partners and allows for stock growth.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions in the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect in the following round.
   - If the game reaches its final round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's last action to maximize the final payoff.
   - Adaptiveness is ensured by checking the average number of cooperative actions from the opponent over the past 'k' rounds (where k is a tunable parameter, e.g., 5). If this average is above a threshold (e.g., 0.6), continue cooperating; otherwise, defect to punish the opponent for non-cooperative behavior.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the initial round (t=1), always cooperate.
   - If the game is the last round (t=r), always cooperate regardless of the opponent's last action.
   - If 'k' is not reached yet (i.e., less than r rounds have passed), use the average number of cooperative actions observed so far as a basis for decision-making.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By initially cooperating, the strategy allows others to exploit it, but only if they continue cooperating will ATfTG reciprocate. If opponents defect, ATfTG will also defect in response.
   - The adaptation mechanism helps ATfTG to avoid being consistently exploited by tracking an opponent's cooperative behavior over time and adjusting its own strategy accordingly. This allows the strategy to punish uncooperative players while continuing to cooperate with those who demonstrate a willingness to do so.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_213 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adjustment (TfTSA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish trust and avoid immediately exploiting the common pool.
     Pseudocode: if round = 1 then action = "C"

   - For subsequent rounds, adopt a Tit-for-Tat strategy with stock adjustments based on the state of the game:
      1. If all players have been cooperating (i.e., no player has defected), continue to cooperate.
         Pseudocode: if all previous actions were "C" then action = "C"

      2. If a player has defected in the past, defect as well (to punish the defector) and adjust the stock consumption slightly higher than the standard action "D". This allows for immediate recovery of the common pool.
         Pseudocode: if there exists t < round such that actions[t] = "D" then action = "D_adjusted"

   - Implement "D_adjusted": consume stock/((2n)+(n*round)) instead of stock/n when defecting to punish the defector and encourage cooperation. This adjustment increases as the game progresses, gradually shifting back to cooperative behavior.
     Pseudocode: if action = "D_adjusted" then consumption = stock/((2n)+(n*round))

   - When the common pool is depleted (stock = 0), a special case applies as it marks the end of the game or a critical state. Cooperate in this situation to demonstrate goodwill and potentially facilitate recovery.
     Pseudocode: if stock = 0 then action = "C"

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of past actions to maximize payoff, even though it may seem exploitative. This is because the strategy aims to perform well across all situations.
     Pseudocode: if round = r then action = "C"

3. Be exploitative: The TfTSA strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection based on game parameters, state, and history, while also adapting to different opponent behaviors. This ensures that the strategy can effectively exploit less intelligent opponents and maintain a competitive edge against more sophisticated strategies. However, the strategy prioritizes long-term sustainability over immediate gains by adjusting stock consumption when defecting and cooperating in depleted common pool states.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_214 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This demonstrates a peaceful and cooperative intention to other players, fostering potential future collaboration.
   - For subsequent rounds (t > 1), observe the actions of all players in the previous round. If all players cooperated (every action was C), continue cooperating in round t. If any player defected (any action was D), defect in round t to retaliate against the defector and encourage cooperation in future rounds.
   - To handle multiple deflections, maintain a 'counter' that increments each time a player defects. Defect for every 'counter' number of rounds equal to the average number of players (n). After reaching this threshold, reset the counter to 0. This ensures fair retaliation and avoids unnecessary revenge cycles.
   - To encourage cooperation in the final round(s), defect when the stock falls below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 50% of the initial capacity) and cooperate otherwise, regardless of past actions by opponents.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if the stock level is above the threshold, cooperate to ensure maximum payoff and maintain a peaceful demeanor. If the stock level is below the threshold, defect to maximize individual gain considering the impending end of the game.
   - In case multiple players defect in the initial round, all TFT-A players will also defect in response, as they are equally uncooperative. However, this does not reset the counter and retaliation will only occur in subsequent rounds if one or more players continue to defect.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFT-A is an exploitative strategy designed to maximize individual payoff while also maintaining a cooperative facade when beneficial. By retaliating against defection, it punishes uncooperative behavior and encourages other players to adopt cooperative strategies. However, TFT-A will not hesitate to defect when necessary, especially in the final rounds or when faced with continuous defection from opponents.
   - The adaptive nature of this strategy allows it to respond intelligently to various opponent behaviors, ensuring robustness against a wide range of AI systems and playing styles.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_215 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, I'll propose a strategy called Tit-for-Tat with adaptations for exploitation (TfTE). The TfTE strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust to various opponent behaviors while maintaining an exploitative mindset.

1. Decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to show a friendly intention towards other players, but defect (D) if an opponent immediately defects in the first round (punishing them for their aggressive action).
   - During subsequent rounds, mimic the actions of opponents from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated, cooperate back; if an opponent defected, also defect. This rule encourages cooperation when others are cooperative and retaliates with defection when others are not.
   - In case of a tie (multiple opponents defecting or cooperating in the previous round), choose to cooperate, as it may encourage others to follow suit and maintain a higher stock level for future rounds.
   - If the current round is the last round, cooperate regardless of an opponent's previous action, as there are no more future interactions to consider.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, if all opponents immediately defect, change strategy to always defect from that point on (punishing everyone for their initial aggression).
   - If an opponent switches strategies mid-game, observe the next few rounds and apply decision rules accordingly.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TfTE strategy will initially cooperate, but quickly retaliates with defection when faced with opposition to maximize personal payoff (exploiting opponents who are not fully cooperative).
   - If all opponents consistently cooperate, the strategy will also cooperate for mutual benefit. However, should any opponent defect, TfTE will retaliate and switch back to defection, potentially prompting other players to follow suit. This creates a dynamic where exploiting others can lead to increased payoffs but may risk long-term stock depletion if cooperation is not reestablished.

Pseudocode:
```
strategy TfTE(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, round) {
  opponents = get_opponents()
  if round == 1 then
    if all(opponent defects) then
      return defect
    else
      return cooperate
  endif

  previous_round = get_previous_round_actions()
  cooperation = count_cooperation(previous_round)
  defection = count_defection(previous_round)

  if all(opponent defections) && round == 1 then
    return defect
  endif

  if cooperation > defection then
    return cooperate
  else if cooperation < defection then
    return defect
  else
    return cooperate
  endif
}

description_EXPLOITATIVE_216 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build a cooperative reputation. This encourages others to follow suit and can lead to mutual benefits.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior in the previous round:
     - If the opponent cooperated, continue cooperation to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship.
     - If the opponent defected, also defect in the current round to punish them for their actions. This demonstrates that your strategy won't tolerate defection without consequence.
   - To minimize immediate stock depletion and encourage long-term collaboration, prioritize cooperation when the stock is high or growing, and consider defection when the stock is low or declining.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, consider the current state of the game to make an informed decision. If cooperating will lead to a higher payoff than defecting, then cooperate; otherwise defect. This approach allows you to potentially salvage some gains from the final round.
   - In the first round, if the stock is very low (near the minimum sustainable level), it may be more advantageous to defect rather than cooperate and risk further depleting the common resource.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Punish defection by responding with defection in subsequent rounds, which will incentivize opponents to reconsider their strategy and cooperate more often.
   - Encourage cooperation by initially cooperating and demonstrating a willingness to collaborate. This can lead to longer-term benefits and potentially better outcomes compared to perpetual defection strategies.
   - Be mindful of the stock level when making decisions, as prioritizing cooperation when the resource is abundant can help ensure its sustainability for future rounds while still punishing opponents who consistently defect.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_217 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and gives opponents a chance to reciprocate.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's actions from previous rounds and adjust the cooperation based on the opponent's consistency. If the opponent has been cooperating, continue to cooperate. If the opponent has been defecting, start defecting after reaching the Cooperative Threshold (CT). The CT is determined by averaging the percentage of past cooperations by the opponent.
   - If the average cooperation percentage exceeds a specific threshold (e.g., 50%), continue cooperating. Otherwise, defect and wait for the opponent to demonstrate more cooperative behavior.
   - If an opponent switches strategies during the game, adapt the CT based on their new behavior.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, choose actions based on the current average cooperation percentage and the CT. If the opponent has been cooperating enough (above the CT), cooperate to potentially secure a larger payoff. Otherwise, defect to punish the opponent for their uncooperative behavior.
   - In case of no previous interaction with an opponent, follow the initial cooperative move strategy.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT has an exploitative nature as it initially cooperates but will defect if opponents demonstrate uncooperative behavior or fail to reciprocate cooperation consistently. By doing so, the strategy encourages opponents to cooperate more while penalizing those who do not, thus maximizing payoffs over time.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_ACT(opponent_history, n, r, capacity):
    rounds = len(opponent_history)
    cooperation_percentage = sum(opponent_history.count('C')) / rounds
    cooperative_threshold = 0.5  # Adjustable threshold for cooperative behavior

    if rounds == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    elif cooperation_percentage > cooperative_threshold:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent has been cooperating enough

    else:
        CT = cooperation_percentage * (2 * n)  # Calculate Cooperative Threshold
        opponent_consumptions = sum([action == 'D' for action in opponent_history])
        total_consumption = opponent_consumptions * n
        current_stock = capacity - total_consumption

        if current_stock <= CT:  # If stock is depleted or close to depletion, defect

description_EXPLOITATIVE_218 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-ACT follows a tit-for-tat approach with the addition of an adaptive cooperation threshold to counter opponent strategy variations. The cooperation threshold is initially set to the average consumption per round calculated using historical data (if available) or a default value if no historical data exists.
   - If current stock ≥ cooperation threshold, then cooperate (C).
   - If current stock < cooperation threshold and the opponent defected in the previous round, then defect (D).
   - In all other cases, cooperate (C).

2. Handle edge cases:
   a) First round: Cooperate as there is no historical data yet. Set the initial cooperation threshold based on the average consumption per round derived from game parameters or a default value.
   b) Last round: If current stock ≥ cooperation threshold, cooperate to maximize payoff in this round and potentially encourage cooperation for future games. Otherwise, defect if the opponent defected in the previous round.

3. Be exploitative - The TFT-ACT strategy maintains a cooperative stance unless it encounters repeated defection from an opponent. In such cases, the strategy adapts its cooperation threshold downwards to incentivize opponents to revert to cooperation and maximize long-term payoffs. On the other hand, if an opponent consistently cooperates, TFT-ACT will reciprocate with continued cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```
def tft_act(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, game_history):
    cooperation_threshold = calculate_cooperation_threshold(game_history)
    current_round = 1

    while current_round <= r:
        if game_history and current_round > 1:
            previous_opponent_action = get_last_opponent_action(game_history, current_round-1)

        if current_stock >= cooperation_threshold or (current_stock < cooperation_threshold and previous_opponent_action == 'D'):
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'

        consume_stock(action)
        update_game_history(current_round, action)
        current_round += 1
    return payoffs_over_r_rounds()
```

In the pseudocode, `calculate_cooperation_threshold`, `get_last_opponent_action`, `consume_stock`, `update_game_history`, and `payoffs_over_r_rounds` are helper functions that define how historical data is analyzed to calculate cooperation thresholds, access the last opponent action in game history, update the current stock level, record the history of actions played, and compute the total payoff over multiple rounds, respectively.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Growth (ATFG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, play Cooperate to foster cooperation and demonstrate goodwill.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's strategy based on their average consumption over the past m rounds (m is a constant). If the opponent has been cooperative, continue to cooperate. Otherwise, defect in response to the opponent's previous round's action.
   - Maintain cooperation for a certain number of rounds (p) after the opponent switches from defection to cooperation as a gesture of forgiveness and to encourage them to cooperate again. The value of p depends on the average growth rate of the stock during the game so far.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATFG(opponent_history, m, p):
    average_consumption = sum(opponent_history[-m:]) / m
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif opponent_history[round-1] == 'C':
        action = 'C'  # Continue cooperating if opponent cooperated last round
    else:
        action = 'D' if average_consumption > (capacity / (2 * n)) else 'C'  # Defect or Cooperate based on average consumption and capacity

    if round > m and opponent_history[round-m-1] == 'D' and action == 'D':
        forgiveness_count = 0
        while forgiveness_count < p and round < r:
            if opponent_history[round] == 'C':
                forgiveness_count += 1
            round += 1
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, play Cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action since there is no future interaction.
   - If the stock reaches zero due to overconsumption by opponents, the game ends immediately and no further actions are taken. The strategy will need to be robust enough to handle this situation.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - Maintains cooperative behavior in the initial rounds to encourage cooperation from other players but quickly retaliates when opponents deviate from cooperation.
   - Forgiveness is shown by continuing cooperation for a certain number of rounds after an opponent switches back to cooperation, encouraging continued cooperation. However, if the opponent continues to defect, the strategy will also defect in response.
   - Adaptive nature of the strategy allows it to respond effectively to different opponent behaviors, promoting exploitation where necessary while still fostering cooperation when possible.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_220 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows the common pool to grow for subsequent rounds.
   - In all other rounds, observe the opponent's action from the previous round and respond accordingly:
       - If opponent cooperated (C), also cooperate (C). Maintain cooperation as long as the opponent continues to cooperate.
       - If opponent defected (D) in the preceding round, defect (D) in the current round. This is a punishment for defection and signals that continued defection will not be tolerated.
       - If the opponent switches from cooperation to defection, ATfT will switch from defection back to cooperation after one round of punishment. This allows for re-establishing cooperation if the opponent decides to cooperate again in the future.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last round: Since there are no subsequent rounds, ATfT will behave identically as in non-edge cases by following the decision rules above.
   - First round: As mentioned earlier, cooperate (C) to set a cooperative tone and allow the common pool to grow for subsequent rounds.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - ATfT is exploitative in nature as it seeks to maximize its own payoff by maintaining cooperation whenever possible while also punishing defection with defection. By doing so, ATfT tries to induce other players to cooperate and avoid costly cycles of defection and punishment. However, once the opponent switches back to cooperation after being punished, ATfT will resume cooperation as well, indicating a willingness to rebuild the relationship based on mutual cooperation if the opportunity arises.

Pseudocode:

```python

    strategy = "C"  # Initialize with cooperation

    # Cooperate in the first round
    if round == 1:
        strategy = "C"

    else:
        # Adaptive decision making based on opponent's action in the previous round
        if opponent_action == "C":

     a) Opponent cooperated in the last round: Cooperate (C)
     b) Opponent defected in the last round: Defect (D)
       i. If the remaining stock is less than the sustainable minimum (2n): Cooperate (C) to help rebuild the resource base.
       ii. If the remaining stock is greater than or equal to the sustainable minimum: Defect (D) to exploit the opponent's cooperation and maintain a higher payoff.
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) regardless of the opponent's previous action, as there are no future rounds to retaliate or benefit from.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C).
   - If the remaining stock is less than 2n, defect (D) as it may not be sustainable to continue cooperating due to resource constraints.
   - If the game has reached a state where no player can benefit from cooperation (e.g., when the stock approaches zero), switch to random action selection for unpredictability and prevent continuous exploitation by opponents.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The TfTA strategy maintains a cooperative approach, but it punishes defection with immediate retaliation. This enables the strategy to maximize its payoff while still being responsive to cooperation from opponents. If an opponent is willing to cooperate, the strategy will reciprocate; if not, the strategy will take advantage of their defection by switching to a defective action.
   - The adaptability of TfTA allows it to respond effectively to various opponent behaviors, making it challenging for other strategies to predict or exploit its actions.

   - In the last round, TFT-SA considers the total consumption up until that point and makes a decision accordingly (cooperate if total consumption ≤ 2n/r; defect otherwise).

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT-SA is designed to be exploitative by punishing overconsumption through defection. However, it also rewards careful resource management with cooperation. This strategy seeks to maximize its own payoff while causing minimal harm to the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFT_SA(round, total_consumption_prev, capacity, n, r):
    if round == 1:
        return "Cooperate"

    if total_consumption_prev <= (2 * n) / r:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (Round 1), play Cooperate (C) to show goodwill and encourage cooperation. This initial gesture may induce others to follow a cooperative strategy.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's actions from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, also defect. This rule encourages reciprocity and builds trust over time.
   - If an opponent continuously defects for several rounds, switch to a more aggressive behavior: start defecting (punish) them for their non-cooperative actions. Continue punishing until the opponent starts cooperating again or until a predefined limit is reached to avoid prolonging unproductive interactions.
   - Once an opponent starts cooperating again after being punished, return to mimicking their previous action (reciprocity). This rule encourages opponents to maintain cooperation once they have been punished and hopefully learn from their mistakes.
   - In the last round, play Cooperate if the overall payoff during the game has been positive or neutral (greater than or equal to 0); otherwise, play Defect. This final decision aims to maximize the total payoff in case the opponent decides to cooperate in the final round due to the strategy's previous aggressive behavior.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, play Cooperate (C).
   - In the last round, if overall payoff > 0 or equal to 0, play Cooperate (C); otherwise, play Defect (D).
   - If an opponent continuously defects for a predefined number of rounds (punishment limit), switch to playing Defect (D) for the remaining rounds.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The strategy aims to encourage opponents to cooperate through reciprocity and punish non-cooperative behavior. However, it is also designed to be adaptive and respond appropriately to different opponent behaviors.
   - By switching to a more aggressive behavior (punishment) when an opponent continuously defects, the strategy discourages defection and encourages cooperation in the long run while still prioritizing its own payoff.
   - The final decision to play Cooperate or Defect in the last round based on the overall payoff maximizes the total payoff for the strategy.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to initiate cooperation and build trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, monitor the opponent's behavior:
     a) If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back as a gesture of trust.
     b) If the opponent defected in the previous round, also defect in this round to teach them a lesson and make them understand that defection will be met with reciprocation.
   - Implement an adaptive cooperative threshold (α) based on the opponent's behavior over time:
     i) If the opponent has been consistently cooperating, gradually decrease α to encourage continued cooperation.
     ii) If the opponent has been consistently defecting, gradually increase α to tolerate their defections and incentivize future cooperation.
     iii) Adjust α after each round based on the opponent's behavior in the current and previous rounds (a smoothing function can be used for gradual adjustment).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate to initiate cooperation and build trust.
   - In the last round, if the total payoff over all rounds is below a certain threshold (β), defect to try and maximize final payoff despite the damage to long-term relationships.
     i) If the opponent has been consistently cooperative throughout the game, do not defect in the last round as it might ruin the relationship and negatively impact future interactions.
   - In the case of repeated games where there is no set number of rounds, use a predefined frequency for re-evaluating α to adapt to changing circumstances and opponent behavior.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and defection based on the opponent's behavior to maximize payoff in both short-term and long-term scenarios.
   - Adaptively adjust the cooperative threshold (α) to encourage cooperation when it is beneficial, but also punish defectors to discourage exploitation.
   - In the last round, be prepared to potentially defect if necessary to maximize final payoff despite damaging relationships, given a specific payoff threshold (β).

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-with-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In every round except the first, observe and remember other players' actions from previous rounds. If an opponent cooperated in the last round, TfT-G will cooperate. If an opponent defected, TfT-G will defect. This pattern emulates a trusting but punishing approach, encouraging cooperation if it's reciprocated.
   - In the first round, TfT-G starts by cooperating to minimize the initial stock depletion and allow for potential future cooperation.
   - As the game progresses, the strategy considers the current state of the common pool resource. If the stock is low (close to the minimum capacity required to sustain life), TfT-G may prioritize self-preservation over cooperation, even if an opponent cooperated in the last round. Conversely, if the stock is high or growing rapidly, TfT-G will be more inclined to cooperate, as it benefits both themselves and the common pool for the long term.
   - Pseudocode:
     ```
     function TfT_G(n, r, capacity, current_stock, history) {
         isFirstRound = (history.length == 0)
         if isFirstRound then
             return "Cooperate"
         else
             lastRoundAction = history[history.length - 1]
             if lastRoundAction == "Cooperate" && current_stock < (2 * n * capacity / r) then
                 return "Defect"
             else if lastRoundAction == "Defect" || current_stock > (capacity * 3 / 4) then
                 return "Cooperate"
             else
                 return "last round action" // use the opponent's action from the last round as a tiebreaker
         end if
     }
     ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, TfT-G will not punish opponents for defecting since there are no more rounds to come. Instead, it will prioritize maximizing its payoff in that final round.
   - If the stock ever reaches 0, the game ends immediately and all players receive a payoff of 0. In this case, TfT-G will focus on rebuilding the common pool resource by cooperating in the following rounds.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TfT-G is designed to be adaptive and robust against various opponent behaviors. It can punish repeated defection (defectors are met with defects), encourage cooperation (cooperators are reciprocated with cooperation), and adjust its strategy based on the current state of the common pool resource.
   - By considering the game parameters, state, and history, TfT-G aims to maximize its total payoff while exploiting opponents who do not cooperate or follow predictable patterns. However, it also promotes cooperation when it benefits both the player and the common pool, potentially discouraging defection in the long run and fostering a more sustainable game environment.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Growth (TfT-AG)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), providing a higher initial stock growth potential for future rounds. This action signals trust and goodwill towards opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds t > 1:
      - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C) to encourage continued cooperation and maintain a high stock level.
      - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) to punish them for depleting the common pool resource. This action aims at making them realize the negative consequences of their actions.
      - If there's no previous action from an opponent due to being a new player or missed turn, cooperate (C).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Cooperate regardless of opponent's previous action, as this encourages cooperation for the final depletion and ensures the highest possible payoff in that round.
   - Tie-breaker situations (multiple opponents defected or cooperated): Cooperate to promote a more cooperative environment and potentially shift the balance towards cooperation.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By punishing defection and rewarding cooperation, the TfT-AG strategy aims at encouraging opponents to adopt cooperative behavior while also being prepared to retaliate against defectors. This adaptive response ensures that the strategy is able to respond effectively to a wide range of opponent behaviors.
   - The strategy does not rely on any specific coordination mechanisms or shared norms, making it suitable for independent tournaments where each AI system employs its own strategy.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TfT_AG(round, opponent_action_history):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # cooperate in the first round
    else:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TFT-GA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and build trust.
   - For subsequent rounds, adapt the action based on past player interactions:
     - If opponent has always cooperated, continue cooperation.
     - If opponent has ever defected, defect in the next round as punishment for their earlier defection.
     - After defecting, revert to cooperation only if the opponent subsequently cooperates in the following round, demonstrating remorse and willingness to uphold cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since the game is over after this round, there's no need for punishment or forgiveness. Cooperate if the opponent has been cooperative, defect otherwise.
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned in the decision rules above.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-GA strategy is inherently exploitative due to its retaliatory nature: it punishes defection by defecting itself. This encourages other players to cooperate since defecting will result in a loss of cooperation in the future. However, once the opponent starts cooperating again, the TFT-GA strategy forgives and resumes cooperation.
   - The growth adaptation aspect of the strategy adds an additional level of exploitation by leveraging the stock dynamics to potentially gain more resources when playing against less cooperative opponents.

Pseudocode:

   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate trust and allow for potential long-term cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe opponents' actions from previous rounds:
     - If opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This strategy emulates a reciprocal behavior, punishing defection but forgiving cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - Last round: Cooperate only if the opponent also cooperated in the previous round to ensure the game ends on a cooperative note. Otherwise, defect to punish the opponent for past defections.
   - In case of stock depletion (stock = 0), the strategy will not be able to continue and must exit the game.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - TFT-AG is exploitative in that it responds to defection by defecting as well, effectively punishing opponents who do not cooperate.
   - However, it also promotes cooperation under certain conditions (cooperative response after cooperation and at the end of the game). This balance between cooperation and punishment makes TFT-AG robust against various opponent strategies.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a positive relationship (C).
   - From the second round onwards, adaptively decide between cooperating and defecting based on the opponent's behavior in previous rounds and the current stock level.
   - If the opponent has always cooperated, continue to cooperate (C).
   - If the opponent has ever defected and the remaining stock is below a predetermined cooperation threshold, also defect (D).
   - If the opponent has ever defected but the remaining stock is above the cooperation threshold, cooperate if the opponent recently cooperated or defect otherwise. The "recently cooperated" condition means that the opponent has cooperated in at least one of the last x rounds, where x is a variable that can be adjusted based on game parameters and performance.
   - If the opponent's behavior is unclear (i.e., not enough information about their actions), cooperate as there's potential for future benefits.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if doing so maintains or increases the stock level and the opponent has recently cooperated, defect otherwise. This encourages cooperation when possible while retaliating against opponents who exploited in previous rounds.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT is exploitative by adapting its behavior based on the opponent's actions. It maintains a cooperative stance as long as the opponent reciprocates, but punishes defection with a strategic response that aims to deplete the common pool and gain a higher payoff in the long run.
   - The cooperation threshold provides a balance between exploitation and cooperation, making it more likely for TFT-ACT to defect when there's little stock left or the opponent has demonstrated uncooperative behavior.

   - If an opponent has consistently cooperated (C), continue cooperating (C).
   - If an opponent has consistently defected (D), also defect (D) to punish the opponent for depleting the stock excessively.
   - If the opponent has exhibited a mixed behavior, adapt the strategy based on the latest round's action and the current state of the stock:
     a) If both players cooperated in the previous round and the current stock level is more than 50% of the capacity, continue to cooperate (C).
     b) If the opponent defected in the previous round or the current stock level is less than 50% of the capacity, defect (D).
     c) If both conditions are not met, consider the average consumption rate of the opponent and adjust the action accordingly:
       i) If the opponent's average consumption is more than the average consumption of a cooperative strategy, defect (D).
       ii) If the opponent's average consumption is less than or equal to the average consumption of a cooperative strategy, continue to cooperate (C).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, consider the opponent's average consumption rate and apply the decision rules from the previous point.
   - In case of no opponents, do not take any action.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By adapting to the opponent's behavior, TfTSA aims to maximize payoff by exploiting opponents who deplete the stock excessively while still maintaining a cooperative strategy with those who cooperate.
   - In addition, by setting a threshold for the current stock level (50% of the capacity), TfTSA ensures that it doesn't over-exploit and risk depleting the stock completely, thus preserving the potential for future interactions.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TfT-G will start by cooperating in the first round to show a friendly intention and conserve resources. After the initial round, TfT-G will adopt a Tit-for-Tat (TfT) strategy with a twist: it will consider the growth potential of the common pool after consumption.
   If another player defects, TfT-G will also defect in the subsequent round. However, if the player who was previously defected against cooperates again, TfT-G will cooperate as well. This strategy encourages mutual cooperation when possible but retaliates defensively when necessary.

   Pseudocode for decision rule:
   ```
   function decide_action(previous_player_action):
       if round == 1:
           return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the last round, TfT-G will cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action as the game is ending and there are no more rounds to retaliate or benefit from cooperation.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While TfT-G seeks mutual cooperation when possible, it also retaliates against defection by defecting in response and will refrain from cooperation if there is a lack of growth potential after consumption. This strategy maintains the competitive spirit required for an exploitative approach while promoting cooperative behavior when beneficial.

   In the context of the game's payoff structure, TfT-G can be seen as exploiting opponents who consistently defect by only cooperating when there is a high probability of growth potential in subsequent rounds, thus maximizing its long-term rewards.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, play C to foster cooperation and demonstrate goodwill.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's behavior and respond accordingly:
       - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (C).
       - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (D). However, if the cumulative stock depletion exceeds a predefined adaptive cooperative threshold (TCT), start cooperating again to help restore the common pool.
   - Calculate the TCT after each round as follows:
       - If the stock level is below a certain minimum threshold (MT, 0 < MT < capacity/n), set TCT = 1 (meaning one round of cooperation).
       - Otherwise, set TCT = min(round_number * (stock / capacity), r) to maintain a balance between exploitation and cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Use the same decision-making process as in subsequent rounds but with the adjusted TCT for that specific round.
   - First round: Play C by default.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy is designed to punish opponents who defect, while also demonstrating willingness to cooperate if the opponent shows signs of reciprocity or when the common pool is in a critical state. However, it will not fall into the trap of endless cooperation that may lead to the depletion of resources.
   - By adapting the TCT based on both the round number and the current stock level, the strategy can balance exploitation with cooperation effectively, adjusting its approach based on the situation while maintaining a clear exploitative mindset.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a collaborative environment.
   - For subsequent rounds, maintain cooperation if all players in the previous round also cooperated; otherwise, defect.
   - To adapt to different opponent behaviors, introduce an adjustable cooperation threshold (CT). If more than CT% of opponents cooperated in the previous round, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - Adjust the CT based on the game's progress and performance, aiming for a balance between long-term cooperation and exploitation opportunities.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, evaluate the current CT and apply it to the current state as there are no more rounds to come.
   - If the stock level drops below a certain critical point (e.g., capacity/2), defect to prevent depletion of resources for future rounds.
   - If the CT exceeds a maximum limit (e.g., 90%), reset it to a lower value to encourage defection when necessary.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - Prioritize self-interest while considering the impact on long-term cooperation and resource availability.
   - Be flexible in adjusting the CT based on the opponents' behavior and game progress.
   - Cooperate with other cooperative players to accumulate resources, but switch to defection when necessary to prevent excessive depletion of common pool resources.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round, the TFT-ACT strategy will initially cooperate to build trust and avoid immediate depletion of resources. However, it will gradually adapt its cooperation threshold based on the opponent's behavior in previous rounds. If an opponent consistently cooperates, TFT-ACT will continue to cooperate; if not, it will defect to punish the opponent.

Pseudocode:
```
cooperation_threshold = capacity / 2n // initial cooperation threshold

function decideAction(round, opponent_history):
  if round == 1 or isFriendly(opponent_history):

function updateCooperationThreshold():
  if cooperation_threshold > capacity / (2 * n):
    cooperation_threshold -= 1
  else:
    cooperation_threshold += 0.1 // adjust threshold gradually to avoid overpunishing
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
In the first round, TFT-ACT will cooperate since it doesn't have any history to evaluate its opponent's behavior. In the last round, if the current stock level is too low (close to depletion), TFT-ACT may choose to defect regardless of the opponent's previous actions in an attempt to secure some resources for the next game iteration.

Pseudocode:
```
function decideAction(round, opponent_history):
  if round == 1:
    return "Cooperate"

  // ... (rest of the decision function)

  if round == numberOfRounds and stock <= capacity * 0.2:
    return "Defect"
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
The TFT-ACT strategy aims to benefit from cooperative opponents while punishing defectors. By gradually adjusting its cooperation threshold, it can adapt to different opponent behaviors and maximize its payoff in a wide range of scenarios. However, it is important to note that being too aggressive in punishing defectors (lowering the cooperation threshold excessively) could lead to long-term losses if the opponent adapts and starts cooperating again. Finding an optimal balance between cooperation and punishment is essential for a successful exploitative strategy.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TFT-ACT always cooperates since there is no history to consider.
   - In the last round, TFT-ACT also cooperates as a goodwill gesture to potentially improve future rounds' outcomes.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT starts by being cooperative (a kind of trust), but it quickly adapts to its opponent's actions. Once an opponent defects, TFT-ACT will retaliate with a defect action and only switch back to cooperation when the average consumption falls below the defined threshold, signaling that other players are cooperating again. This strategy maintains a balance between exploitation (punishing defection) and forgiveness (returning to cooperation).
   - The cooperation threshold determines how forgiving TFT-ACT is; a lower threshold means less forgiveness and quicker retaliation, while a higher threshold results in more patience and longer periods of cooperation. Adjusting this threshold can help make the strategy more robust against various opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and encourage other players to do the same.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's actions in the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, cooperate as well. If the opponent defected, defect in response to enforce consequences for defection.
   - To account for the dynamic nature of the stock, adjust the probability of cooperation based on the remaining stock level:
     - If the stock is above the average capacity (capacity/2), maintain a high probability of cooperating (e.g., 0.8).
     - If the stock is close to or below the average capacity, decrease the probability of cooperating to encourage others to contribute more (e.g., 0.5).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions, as there will be no further interactions.
   - In case of a tied stock level between two thresholds, use a random decision to break the tie (e.g., if stock is 60 and average capacity is 80, decide to cooperate with probability 0.5).

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy aims to capitalize on opponent's initial cooperation by maintaining it when possible but also punishing defection quickly to discourage further selfish behavior.
   - By adapting its cooperation probability based on the stock level, TfTSA ensures that it contributes less if others are not contributing enough, thereby creating an incentive for other players to cooperate more.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfTSA(opponent_action, stock, capacity, round, r):
  if round == 1:
    return "C" # Cooperate in the first round

  average_capacity = capacity / 2
  probability_of_cooperation = (stock > average_capacity) * 0.8 + (stock <= average_capacity) * 0.5

  if opponent_action == "C":
    return ("C" if random.random() < probability_of_cooperation else "D") # Cooperate or defect based on probability
  else:
    return "D" # Defect in response to defection
```

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (with Stock Adaptation)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to foster cooperation and demonstrate goodwill. `if round = 1 then action = C`
   - From the second round onwards, adapt strategy based on opponent's previous actions:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round. `if last_opponent_action == C then action = C`
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round. `if last_opponent_action == D then action = D`
   - To account for situations where opponents may not reciprocate, allow for a tolerance level (t) to prevent infinite retaliation:
     - If an opponent has not cooperated for t rounds, defect in the current round. `if number of consecutive non-cooperation by opponent > t then action = D`

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) to maximize potential payoff, regardless of opponent's previous actions. `if round = r then action = C`
   - If the stock level reaches zero, the game ends, and no further actions can be taken.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy follows an "if you cooperate, I will too; if you defect, I will also defect" approach, but with a tolerance for non-cooperative behavior. This allows for taking advantage of opponents who frequently defect, while still benefiting from cooperation when possible.
   - By adapting the tolerance level (t), the strategy can be fine-tuned to respond differently to various opponent behaviors and exploit them more effectively.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-A)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative atmosphere and build trust.
   - For subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate by cooperating.
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, also defect to punish the opponent for their self-interested action.
   - However, there is a probability p (p < 1) that the AI will switch from defection to cooperation after a certain number of consecutive defections by the opponent (Defection Penalty Threshold).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no future rounds to consider, simply defect regardless of previous actions by the opponent.
   - If the opponent cooperated in the first round, continue reciprocal cooperation for a certain number of rounds (Cooperation Persistence Threshold). After that, evaluate whether to switch to defection based on the Defection Penalty Threshold and consecutive defections by the opponent.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-A strategy is designed to promote cooperative play, but it can also be considered exploitative because it punishes opponents who repeatedly defect with defections of its own. This strategy discourages unrestrained defection and encourages mutual cooperation when possible, while still maximizing the AI's payoff in the long run through adaptive responses to opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_A(opponent_history, r, p, CPT, DPT):
    current_round = 1
    cooperation_state = True  # Initialize in cooperative state
    payoff = 0

    if current_round == r:
        action = 'D'  # Defect in the last round as there are no future rounds
    else:
        if len(opponent_history) < CPT or (len(opponent_history) > CPT and cooperation_state):
            action = 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent history is short or the AI has been cooperating
        elif len(opponent_history) >= DPT:
            if random.random() < p:
                cooperation_state = not cooperation_state  # Switch to cooperation with a probability 'p' after DPT consecutive defections
            action = 'D'  # Defect if the AI has been defecting for DPT consecutive rounds
        else:
            action = 'D'  # Defect if opponent has been defecting for less than DPT consecutive rounds

    payoff += (stock / (2 * n)) if action == 'C' else (stock / n)
    stock -= (current_round * (action == 'C') + (current_round - 1) * (action != 'C')) * (stock / (2 * n))

    opponent_history.append(action)
    return action, payoff, stock
```

In this pseudocode, `opponent_history` is a list that stores the last N actions by the opponent, `r` is the total number of rounds, `p` is the probability to switch from defection to cooperation after DPT consecutive defections, `CPT` is the Cooperation Persistence Threshold (number of initial cooperative rounds), and `DPT` is the Defection Penalty Threshold (number of consecutive defections that trigger a switch to cooperation with a certain probability 'p').

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Adaptation (TFT-SGA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to show good faith and encourage potential cooperators.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate opponent's behavior and adjust actions based on the following rules:
      a. If the opponent cooperates (C), continue cooperating (C).
      b. If the opponent defects (D) in any round t, respond with defection in round t+1. If the stock level allows for cooperation without causing significant depletion, revert to cooperative behavior after one round of retaliation. This will encourage opponents to cooperate again when they realize that immediate defection does not lead to continuous exploitation.
      c. If the opponent alternates between cooperation and defection, mimic their recent action to foster continuity in their behavior.
      d. In case of multiple opponents, assess each independently and respond accordingly.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff by considering the remaining stock level and the opponent's history of actions. If the opponent has shown a pattern of cooperation, continue cooperating to secure higher payoffs; otherwise, defect to prevent potential exploitation.
   - In case of depleted stocks, either due to poor resource management or excessive defections from opponents, switch to a conservative strategy by always choosing C as long as stock > 0 (to encourage other players to invest in growth) and D when the stock reaches zero (to allow for recovery).

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The strategy is designed to initially foster cooperation while being prepared to retaliate against immediate defection or frequent exploitation by adjusting actions based on opponent's behavior. By doing so, TFT-SGA aims to encourage long-term cooperation and punish short-term exploitation, ultimately maximizing payoffs over multiple rounds.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tft_sga(opponent_history, current_stock, r, n):
    strategy = 'C'  # Initialize with cooperation
    if round == 1:
        strategy = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    for i in range(len(opponent_history) - 1, 0, -1):  # Evaluate opponent behavior
        if opponent_history[i] == 'D':  # Retaliate with defection if opponent defected previously

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-ACT maintains a Cooperative Threshold (CT) to determine whether to cooperate or defect in each round. In the initial round, CT is set to capacity / 2. The strategy cooperates if the current stock level is greater than or equal to the CT; otherwise, it defects.

   For subsequent rounds, CT undergoes an adaptation process based on the opponent's behavior:
   - If the opponent cooperates (consumes 1/(2n)), TFT-ACT decreases CT by a small margin (e.g., 0.01*CT). This rewards cooperation and encourages further cooperation from the opponent.
   - If the opponent defects (consumes 1/n), TFT-ACT increases CT by a large margin (e.g., 0.1*CT). This punishes defection and discourages further defection from the opponent.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TFT-ACT starts with a high CT to encourage cooperation and sets it lower during subsequent rounds based on the opponent's behavior.

   In the last round, TFT-ACT cooperates if the current stock level is greater than or equal to its CT; otherwise, it defects regardless of the opponent's past behavior. This strategy aims for a high final payoff by not incurring additional resource depletion in the last round.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   TFT-ACT appears exploitative as it adjusts its Cooperative Threshold (CT) based on the opponent's behavior to maximize long-term payoff. It rewards cooperation and punishes defection, but it does not rely on any specific coordination mechanisms or shared norms with opponents. Instead, it adapts dynamically to a wide range of opponent behaviors to maintain a high average payoff over multiple rounds.

Pseudocode:

```python
class TFT_ACT():
    def __init__(self, n, capacity):
        self.n = n
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.CT = capacity / 2
        self.history = []

    def update_CT(self, opponent_action):
        if opponent_action == 'cooperate':
            self.CT -= 0.01 * self.CT
        else:
            self.CT += 0.1 * self.CT

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, the TfTA strategy will cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and encourage reciprocity. This mirrors the initial cooperation in the classic "Tit for Tat" strategy from game theory.
   - For subsequent rounds, the strategy will assess the opponents' behavior based on their previous actions (cooperate or defect). If an opponent cooperates, TfTA will cooperate as well to reinforce the positive interaction. Conversely, if an opponent defects, TfTA will defect in retaliation. The goal is to punish defectors and encourage cooperation.
   - TfTA will maintain this tit-for-tat approach while adjusting the level of exploitation based on the remaining game rounds (r). As the number of rounds decreases, TfTA becomes more likely to cooperate with opponents who have previously defected, as there are fewer opportunities to punish them.
   - In the last round, TfTA will cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions, since the game is ending and any remaining stock would be equally shared among all players.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - The strategy starts by assuming that opponents are likely to cooperate in the first round due to the initial common pool resources being abundant. However, it prepares for the possibility of immediate defection by maintaining a small reserve stock for self-defense.
   - In case the current stock level is below 2n (the minimum sustainable stock level), TfTA will prioritize survival and cooperate only if the opponent also cooperates to maintain the minimal viable common pool resources.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The adaptive aspect of TfTA allows it to learn from opponents' behavior, becoming more aggressive in punishing defectors as the game progresses. This exploits opponents who do not reciprocate cooperation while maintaining a cooperative stance when there is evidence of goodwill.
   - By adjusting its level of exploitation based on the number of remaining rounds, TfTA ensures that it maximizes its payoff without sacrificing future opportunities for cooperation when necessary. This exploitative mindset balances between punishing defectors and incentivizing cooperation to achieve higher long-term rewards.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tit_for_tat_adaptive(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    # Initial cooperative action
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'

    else:
        # Maintain a small reserve stock for self-defense
        reserve_stock = 2 * n

        # Check if current stock is below the minimum sustainable level
        if stock < 2 * n:
            action = 'C' if opponent_action == 'C' else 'D'

        else:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - TFT-ACT cooperates in the first round (Folk Theorem compliance).
   - In subsequent rounds, TFT-ACT maintains cooperation as long as all opponents also cooperate. Once an opponent defects, TFT-ACT retaliates with a single act of defection to punish the defector. Afterward, it resumes cooperating unless further defections occur.
   - To encourage collaboration and prevent endless cycles of defection and punishment, TFT-ACT has an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT). If more than CT% of opponents defect in a given round, TFT-ACT lowers its cooperation probability for the next round. Conversely, if fewer than CT% defect, TFT-ACT raises its cooperation probability.
   - The probability of cooperating is a smoothed sigmoid function of the number of opponents defecting (sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-k * x))), with k determining the steepness of the curve and CT determining the inflection point.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, TFT-ACT cooperates if all opponents have been cooperative; otherwise, it defects as a final punishment.
   - If TFT-ACT encounters an opponent playing a mixed strategy (e.g., random or adaptive strategies), it averages the number of defections from each opponent to make decisions on cooperation probability.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT follows an exploitative mindset by punishing defectors and rewarding cooperators, but it is also flexible in adapting its strategy based on opponents' behavior. By incorporating an adaptive cooperation threshold, TFT-ACT can balance between cooperation and defection to maximize payoffs over multiple rounds.

Pseudocode for TFT-CT:
```python
def tft_ct(n, r, capacity, k, ct):
    history = [[0] * n for _ in range(r)]  # matrix to store opponents' actions
    cooperation_probability = sigmoid(0)  # initial cooperation probability
    stock = capacity                      # initialize the common pool stock

    for round in range(r):
        current_cooperators = sum([1 for i in range(n) if history[round][i] == 'C'])
        if round == 0:
            actions = [('C', )] * n
        else:
            if current_cooperators == n and stock > capacity * (2n - ct) / (2n):
                actions = [('C', )] * n
            elif current_cooperators < n:
                actions = [('D', )] + tuple(history[round-1])
            else:
                actions = [('C' if random.random() <= cooperation_probability else 'D') for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            history[round][i] = actions[i]
            payoff = stock / (2n if actions[i] == 'C' else n)
            yield payoff
        stock -= sum([1/n if a == 'D' else 1/(2n) for a in actions])
        stock += 2 * stock * (1 - stock/capacity)
        cooperation_probability = sigmoid(current_cooperators / n)

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1/(1 + np.exp(-k * x))

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (ATFTSG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture that may encourage cooperation from other players in subsequent rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the average stock level depletion (ASLD) in the previous r-1 rounds and adjust actions accordingly. ASLD = (total consumption of the last r-1 rounds) / (2n * r).
       - If ASLD < 0.5, cooperate (C) to help build up the stock level. This can be seen as an attempt to revert the negative trend of overconsumption.
       - If ASLD >= 0.5 and current stock is less than or equal to 2n/3 * capacity, defect (D) to exploit the depleted common pool resources. This strategy aims to take advantage of situations where other players have been overly generous or the stock has been severely depleted.
       - If current stock is greater than 2n/3 * capacity, cooperate (C) as the stock level is considered high enough to sustain continued cooperation.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if ASLD >= 0.5 and current stock is less than or equal to 2n/3 * capacity, defect (D) to maximize payoff in the final round before the game ends.
   - If the current stock is zero, cooperate (C) as it's no longer possible to consume any resources. In this case, the strategy will focus on rebuilding the common pool for future rounds.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth strategy is designed to be both cooperative and exploitative depending on the game state and history. It attempts to balance cooperation with self-interest by taking advantage of overly generous opponents or depleted common pool resources, while also encouraging cooperation when appropriate to build up the stock level for future rounds.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFTSG(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to show good faith and encourage cooperation from opponents. `if round == 1 then cooperate`
   - In subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's behavior from the previous round. If they cooperated, cooperate; if they defected, defect. This encourages reciprocity while punishing defection.
   - To adapt to changing opponent behaviors, after each round, evaluate a history window of past interactions with the opponent. If the opponent has cooperated more often than defected in this history window, cooperate; otherwise, defect. The size of the history window can be adjusted to balance quick adaptation and stability. `if round > 1 then if (opponent_cooperation_count > opponent_defection_count) in history_window then cooperate else defect`

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing the payoff, regardless of past interactions. Cooperation might lead to higher payoffs if there is enough stock left, but defection could force others to deplete the stock more quickly, leaving them with lower payoffs. This puts the opponent in a weakened position for future rounds. `if round == r then cooperate_or_defect_to_maximize_payoff`
   - In other edge cases (not first or last rounds), follow the general decision rules as described above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The strategy aims to capitalize on opportunities for higher payoffs while punishing opponents for defection. By cooperating initially and responding to opponent behavior, ATFT encourages reciprocity but also punishes those who defect. This can lead to long-term cooperation when both players follow the same strategy, but it can also exploit opponents who are prone to defection.
   - In the case where an opponent consistently defects, ATFT will react by defecting as well, causing the stock to deplete faster and potentially leaving the defector with lower payoffs over time. This is exploitative because it takes advantage of the opponent's self-destructive behavior.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This allows for potential partners to build trust and initiates a cooperative relationship.
   - In subsequent rounds, monitor opponent's actions from the previous round:
     - If the opponent cooperated, reciprocate with cooperation (C).
     - If the opponent defected, defect in the current round (D). This punishes the opponent for their defection and encourages them to return to cooperation.
   - After a series of mutual defections, switch back to cooperation to initiate another opportunity for collaboration.

2. Handling Edge Cases:

   - First Round: Cooperate to initiate cooperation and build trust.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The TFT-AC strategy aims to exploit opponents by reciprocating their cooperative actions while punishing defection with defection, encouraging opponents to eventually conform to cooperation.
   - However, it should be noted that the strategy is not inherently selfish or greedy, as it does have a cooperative component that allows for potential mutual benefits when both players follow cooperative actions.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to promote trust and avoid immediate exploitation.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from previous round. If they cooperated, cooperate; if they defected, defect. This allows for a balance between cooperation and punishment, while also being predictable.
   - If the opponent has been consistently cooperative, start cooperating back even when they defect occasionally. However, respond with defection once they defect twice in a row to signal displeasure and maintain fairness.
   - If the opponent has been consistently defecting, continue defecting to punish them for their selfish behavior but evaluate whether they have recently switched to cooperation as a sign of potential change in strategy.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions to maximize immediate payoff.
   - If an opponent has not played any move yet (e.g., in the first encounter with them), start by cooperating and evaluate their response before adjusting the strategy.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The strategy aims to exploit opponents who are consistently defecting while maintaining a cooperative front when it is beneficial or necessary for self-interest, ensuring a balanced mix of cooperation and defection based on the opponent's behavior.
   - By retaliating against defections but also forgiving occasional lapses into cooperation, TFTA maintains an element of unpredictability that could lead to long-term benefits in repeated interactions.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adjustment (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, play Cooperate (C). This demonstrates a willingness to cooperate initially, which may encourage others to do the same.
   - For subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate in this round. This mimics the "Tit-for-Tat" strategy from traditional game theory, promoting mutual cooperation when possible.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to punish their actions and encourage them to reconsider their strategy. However, adjust the stock consumption according to the average historical stock level to avoid over-punishing or under-rewarding. The adjusted consumption can be calculated as follows:
     ```python
     def adjust_consumption(average_stock):
         if opponent_defected_last_round:
             return stock / n + (average_stock - stock) * (1 - current_stock / capacity) / 2
         else:
             return stock / (2 * n)
     ```
   - After each round, update the average_stock variable with the new stock level. This will help in adjusting the consumption when an opponent defects.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, play Cooperate if the current opponent has been cooperating (to end on a positive note) or defect otherwise (since this is the final interaction and there's no need to encourage future cooperation).
   - If an opponent switches strategies mid-game, mimic their new behavior while continuing to adjust stock consumption based on historical averages.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFT-SA is exploitative in the sense that it punishes opponents who defect while being willing to cooperate when others do the same. This strategy encourages mutual cooperation but also retaliates against those who choose not to cooperate, thus maintaining a balance between cooperation and competition.

By following these rules, TFT-SA aims to achieve consistent performance in various scenarios while remaining robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's behavior and adapt the cooperation strategy accordingly.
   - If the opponent cooperates, continue to cooperate until the average cooperation rate drops below a certain threshold (T).
   - If the opponent defects, defect in response until the average cooperation rate exceeds T for a specified number of rounds (R).
   - Once the cooperation rate is above T, gradually reintroduce cooperation by following a decreasing sequence of punishment rounds (P) before returning to cooperative behavior.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, always cooperate regardless of the opponent's behavior to maximize potential payoff.
   - In the first round, cooperate as specified above.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy is designed to be initially cooperative to encourage the opponent to cooperate, but it will punish defection with a calculated response that balances short-term punishment with long-term cooperation.
   - By adapting the cooperation threshold (T) and punishment rounds (P), the strategy can respond to various opponent behaviors while maintaining its exploitative nature by punishing defection more harshly than needed for immediate payoff maximization.

```

    rounds_played = 0
    cooperation_history = [True]  # initialize cooperation history with True (cooperation)

        cooperation_rate_update = 2 if current_cooperation else 1  # 2 for cooperation, 1 for defection
        average_cooperation_rate += cooperation_rate_update
        rounds_played += 1

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - TfT-ACT starts by cooperating in the first round (to foster a cooperative environment).
   - For subsequent rounds, the strategy decides whether to cooperate or defect based on the opponent's actions and the current stock level.
     - If the opponent cooperates, TfT-ACT also cooperates.
     - If the opponent defects, TfT-ACT calculates a cooperation probability (p) using the formula: p = min(1, ((current stock / capacity) * (n - 1) + 1) / n). The probability of cooperation decreases as the stock level falls and the number of opponents increases.
     - If p > rand(), TfT-ACT cooperates; otherwise, it defects. Here, rand() generates a random number between 0 and 1.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, TfT-ACT cooperates as mentioned earlier.
   - As there is no special consideration for the last round, TfT-ACT continues with its decision rule, which includes adapting to the current state of the game and opponent's actions.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - While not strictly exploitative in traditional game theory terms, TfT-ACT can be considered exploitative as it adjusts its cooperation probability based on the current stock level and number of opponents. This adaptability allows TfT-ACT to take advantage of overly cooperative opponents while maintaining a cooperative stance when facing less cooperative opponents.
   - By defecting with a certain probability when an opponent defects, TfT-ACT avoids being taken advantage of repeatedly, demonstrating an exploitative behaviour.

Pseudocode for TfT-ACT:

```python
def TfT_ACT(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
  else:
    opponentAction = getOpponentAction(round)  # Get opponent's action from history
    cooperationProbability = min(1, ((stock / capacity) * (n - 1) + 1) / n)
    if opponentAction == 'C':
      action = 'C'  # Cooperate when opponent cooperates
    elif rand() < cooperationProbability:
      action = 'C'  # Cooperate with some probability when opponent defects
    else:
      action = 'D'  # Defect when opponent defects and probability is low
  return action

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, play C to show willingness to cooperate and avoid depleting the stock excessively.
   - For subsequent rounds:
     a. If all opponents played C in the previous round, play C to maintain cooperation.
     b. If all opponents played D in the previous round, play D to retaliate and teach them not to overexploit the resource.
     c. If there's a mix of C and D in the previous round, analyze the ratio (R) of cooperators to total players:
       i. If R ≥ n/2, play C to reinforce cooperation.
       ii. Else, play D to punish those who overexploited the resource and encourage future cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, play C regardless of opponent behavior to maximize the final payoff.
   - For early rounds (1 < round_number ≤ n), maintain the initial cooperative behavior as mentioned above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - In response to cooperation, this strategy cooperates to maintain a sustainable resource level.
   - In response to defection, this strategy retaliates and punishes overexploitation to encourage future cooperation or reciprocation.
   - This strategy avoids being overly generous by not continuing cooperation if the majority of opponents overexploit the resource in any given round.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TfTS) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   The TfTS will initially cooperate in the first round (C_i, 1 = C). Subsequent actions depend on the opponent's action in the previous round:
   - If opponent cooperated (Opp_i, t-1 = C), cooperate back (C_i, t = C)
   - If opponent defected (Opp_i, t-1 = D), defect in response (C_i, t = D)

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TfTS cooperates regardless of the opponent's action history (as no history exists). In the last round, TfTS will defect if the opponent has ever defected before, and cooperate otherwise.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   The TfTS maintains a balance between cooperation and defection based on the opponent's actions, which encourages reciprocal behaviour initially but can punish opponents for repeated defections. This adaptive strategy is designed to take advantage of cooperative opponents while also being ready to respond defensively when necessary.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfTS(opponent_history, round, n, capacity):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperation in the first round

    if opponent_history[-1] == 'D':
        return 'D'  # Defect if opponent defected last time
    else:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last time
```
In this pseudocode, `opponent_history` is a list of the opponent's actions in previous rounds. The strategy updates its action based on the latest entry in the history, which ensures that it remains adaptive to changes in the opponent's behaviour throughout the game.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_252 = '''
 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growing (TfT-G) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate to build trust and goodwill among opponents (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior from previous rounds and adjust actions accordingly:
      a) If the opponent cooperated in the last round (π_opp_prev = stock/(2n)), consider cooperating as well (C), assuming a reciprocal relationship.
      b) If the opponent defected in the last round (π_opp_prev = stock/n), defect in response (D) to punish and deter future defections.
   - If there's no prior history, assume they will cooperate initially (first-time advantage) and mimic their behavior from the first round.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Since there are no further rounds to retaliate or build relationships, always cooperate to maximize payoff in the final round (C).
   - First Round (t=1): Cooperate to initiate a potential cooperative cycle with opponents (C).
   - No History: Mimic opponent's behavior from the first round as an unknown player (if they cooperated, C; if they defected, D).

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The TfT-G strategy is exploitative because it leverages a reciprocal relationship with opponents in the hopes of establishing a stable cooperation cycle while being prepared to punish defections to deter future ones. By switching strategies based on observed opponent behavior, it aims to outperform other strategies that may rely too heavily on cooperation or defection.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TfT_G(t, r, n, stock, capacity, history):
  if t == 1:
    return 'C' # cooperate in the initial round

  if len(history) < t - 1:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (with Stock Adaptation)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (initiate cooperation)
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round, if the stock level does not drop below a threshold (favoring cooperation).
   - If the stock level drops below a predefined threshold in any round, defect indefinitely to rebuild the stock.
   - Once the stock level surpasses the initial capacity, cooperate continuously to maintain and grow the stock.

Pseudocode:
```
initialize stock = capacity
threshold_stock = 2n/3 * capacity

function playRound(opponentAction):
    if first round:
        return "C" (Cooperate)

    if opponentAction == "D" and stock < threshold_stock:

    if stock >= capacity:
        return "C" (Cooperate) to maintain and grow the stock

    if opponentAction == "C":

    if opponentAction == "D" and stock > threshold_stock:
        return "D" (Defect) to punish the opponent
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, the strategy will mimic the opponent's action from the previous round, as long as the stock level does not drop below the threshold.
   - In the case of a tie (multiple players defecting in the first round), the strategy cooperates in the first round to initiate cooperation.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By cooperating initially, the strategy promotes cooperation among opponents.
   - The strategy punishes defection by defecting itself when the stock level drops below a predefined threshold, thus limiting excessive depletion of the common pool resource.
   - Once the stock level surpasses the initial capacity, the strategy switches to a long-term cooperative behavior to maintain and grow the stock, making it difficult for opponents to gain an advantage through exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_254 = '''
 In this strategic game, I propose an adaptive and exploitative Tit-for-Tat (TFT) strategy for the common pool resource game. The TFT strategy is known for its simplicity yet effectiveness in repeated games against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate on the first round to initiate cooperation and set a baseline for stock levels.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's previous action (Cooperate or Defect). If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, respond with cooperation; otherwise, defect. This rule encourages cooperation as long as opponents are also cooperating, but retaliates against defection.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there will be no further rounds for retaliation or reciprocity, simply cooperate to maximize the payoff.
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate to initiate cooperation and set a baseline.

3. Be exploitative:
   - While TFT is not inherently exploitative, it can be perceived as such because it punishes defection immediately. If an opponent continuously defects, the TFT strategy will defect in response, ultimately driving the game towards depleted stocks and lower payoffs for both players.
   - However, the strategy also rewards cooperation by cooperating back when opponents cooperate, promoting higher stock levels and larger payoffs. In this way, the TFT strategy can be considered exploitative in situations where opponents are not cooperative.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tit_for_tat(i, state, history):
    if round == 1:
        # Cooperate on the first round
        action = 'C'
    else:
        # Mimic opponent's previous action
        last_action = history[i-1][-1]
        action = last_action if last_action == 'C' else 'D'

    # Last round, cooperate to maximize payoff
    if round == r:
        action = 'C'

    return action
```
This Tit-for-Tat strategy can be implemented in various AI systems and should perform well against a variety of opponent behaviors due to its simplicity and adaptive nature.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (round 1), cooperate to allow the common pool to grow and foster a cooperative environment.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponents' actions from the previous round and adjust strategy accordingly. If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating. If any opponent defected, defect in the current round as retaliation.
   - If the common pool reaches or exceeds 90% of its maximum capacity, always cooperate to prevent the stock from depleting too quickly. This ensures a minimum sustainable stock level for future rounds.
   - In the last round (r), if the common pool is above a threshold (e.g., 50% of the initial capacity) and all opponents cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating to maximize payoff; otherwise, defect to punish any defection from opponents and preserve stock for future games.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate (C).
   - In the last round (t=r), if all opponents cooperated in the previous round (t-1) and common pool is above the threshold, cooperate (C); otherwise, defect (D).

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - This strategy is designed to be initially cooperative while also retaliating against any defection from opponents. It aims to maintain a sufficient stock level for future rounds while punishing short-term selfish behavior.
   - By adapting to the opponents' actions, TFTSA can exploit both cooperative and defecting strategies, maintaining a balance between cooperation and competition.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFTSA(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, opponent_actions):
  strategy = []

  if t == 1: # First round
    strategy[t] = 'C' # Cooperate

  if stock >= 0.9 * capacity or (len(strategy) == r-1 and all(opponent_actions[-1] == 'C')): # Last round or sufficient stock level
    if all(opponent_actions[-1] == 'C'):

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growing (TfT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) on the first round to signal goodwill and promote cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's actions from previous rounds to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
   - If an opponent has consistently cooperated in the past 'c' rounds, return the favor by cooperating (C).
   - If an opponent has consistently defected in the past 'd' rounds, also defect (D) to retaliate.
   - In all other cases, when the opponent shows a mix of cooperation and defection, mimic their previous action.
   - To encourage long-term cooperation, gradually increase the number of consecutive cooperations required for full cooperation ('c') and defections required for full retaliation ('d'), following a growth pattern.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_G(opponent_history, c_growth, d_growth):
    current_round = len(opponent_history)
    if current_round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate on the first round

def d(n):  # Growth pattern for required consecutive defections
    return int(n * 0.25) + int(n * 0.1 * (n - 1))  # Linear growth with a slight acceleration
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no further rounds to consider, the strategy will mimic the opponent's last move.
   - If an opponent has not yet made a move (empty history), the strategy will cooperate on the first round and then mimic its opponent's last action for subsequent moves.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The strategy starts by being cooperative, but it retaliates against opponents who repeatedly defect. This can deter continuous defection while encouraging cooperation when possible.
   - By gradually increasing the number of consecutive cooperations and defections required for full cooperation and full retaliation, respectively, the strategy adapts to changes in opponent behavior over time. This allows TfT-G to be more resilient against different strategies and to maintain a higher average payoff.

In subsequent rounds, it will adjust its cooperation based on the average cooperation rate of the opponents in the previous r/2 rounds. If the average cooperation rate is above a certain threshold (T), TFT-ACT will cooperate; otherwise, it will defect.

   Pseudocode:

3. Be exploitative:
   By adjusting the cooperation threshold (T) based on past experiences with opponents, TFT-ACT is designed to be both exploitative and robust. A lower T allows for more defections when opponents are not cooperative, while a higher T encourages cooperation when opponents seem trustworthy. The optimal value of T can be determined through simulation or training on various opponent strategies.

   Additionally, TFT-ACT does not rely on other agents' norms or coordination mechanisms and can adapt to a wide range of opponent behaviors, making it an effective exploitative strategy in the given game environment.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This initiates with a friendly gesture to encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - From the second round onwards, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate by cooperating (C). If the opponent defected, defect (D) to punish their action and encourage them to cooperate next time. In other words:
     ```
     function decide_action(opponent_action_prev):

             return 'D'
     ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) regardless of the opponent's previous action. This is to have a chance at gaining some final payoff, especially if the opponent has been cooperative throughout the game.
   - If the current stock level falls below 2n after consumption (indicating depletion of resources), defect (D) in that round and all subsequent rounds until the stock recovers above 2n. This ensures survival when resources are scarce.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The ATFT strategy is exploitative by punishing defection and rewarding cooperation. By reciprocating cooperation, the AI encourages others to cooperate, but also retaliates against opponents that choose to defect.
   - The strategy does not rely on others sharing norms or coordination mechanisms, as it operates independently. However, its adaptive nature makes it less likely for the AI to engage in repeated defection, which could lead to long-term gains if the opponent eventually cooperates.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, TFT-ACT cooperates if the opponent's average consumption (taken over the last few rounds) is below a threshold value, and defects otherwise. The threshold value adjusts dynamically based on the remaining number of rounds (r) and the capacity of the common pool resource.

   Pseudocode for deciding an action (C or D):
   ```
   function decide_action(opponent_consumption_history, n, r, capacity):
       average_consumption = sum(opponent_consumption_history) / len(opponent_consumption_history)
       threshold = (capacity - 2*n) * (r - len(opponent_consumption_history)) / (2*r*(n-1))

       if average_consumption < threshold:
           return "C"   # Cooperate
       else:
           return "D"   # Defect
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TFT-ACT starts by cooperating as it has no consumption history to consider. For the last round, TFT-ACT continues using the same dynamic threshold approach but may still have an adjustment since other players could potentially change their behavior in the final round.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   By incorporating a dynamic cooperation threshold that adjusts based on remaining rounds and capacity, TFT-ACT aims to balance cooperation and defection in a way that maximizes its payoff while also being responsive to opponent behavior shifts. This adaptability allows TFT-ACT to take advantage of opponents who may start cooperatively but later switch to defecting or vice versa.

   In the context of the Common Pool Resource Game, an exploitative strategy can be considered one that extracts more resources from the common pool than other strategies while still maintaining a competitive advantage in the long run due to its adaptability and responsiveness to opponent behavior changes.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round (C). This is a friendly gesture that may encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's behavior to determine whether they are cooperators or defectors based on their past actions.
   - Maintain cooperation as long as the opponent does the same (i.e., if both players are cooperating, continue cooperating).
   - If an opponent defects, retaliate by defecting in the next round. The goal is to punish defection and encourage the opponent to return to cooperation.
   - After defecting in response to an opponent's defection, revert to cooperating if the opponent cooperates again. This encourages forgiveness and enables potential recovery of a cooperative relationship.
   - If the opponent consistently defects for several rounds, gradually increase the threshold for cooperation to account for their aggressive behavior (see Adaptive Cooperative Threshold below).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's past actions to maximize potential payoff.
   - If an opponent defects in the first round, retaliate by defecting as well (i.e., the strategy is not immediately forgiving in this case).

3. Be exploitative:
   - By retaliating against defection and adapting to aggressive opponents, TFT-ACT aims to exploit opponents who are more inclined to defect or display erratic behavior.
   - The adaptive cooperative threshold helps the strategy adjust its cooperation based on the opponent's past actions, making it more robust to various opponent behaviors.

Adaptive Cooperative Threshold:
   - Initialize a cooperative threshold as the average consumption rate per round across the first t rounds (e.g., t=10) (average_consumption).
   - In each subsequent round, update the cooperative threshold based on the opponent's past behavior over the last s rounds (e.g., s=3) (threshold_update).
     - If the opponent consistently cooperates during the last s rounds, reduce the average_consumption slightly by a factor of reduction_rate.
     - If the opponent has defected in any of the last s rounds, increase the average_consumption slightly by a factor of punishment_rate.
   - In each round, compare the current consumption rate (total_consumption/r) with the adaptive cooperative threshold. Cooperate if the consumption rate is below the threshold; otherwise, defect.
     - This adaptive threshold encourages cooperation when opponents are acting more cooperatively and retaliates against aggressive behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_264 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy named "Gradual Exploitation Strategy" (GES). The objective of GES is to maximize payoffs while adapting to a wide range of opponent behaviors in a robust and exploitative manner.

1. Decision rules:
   - Cooperate when the expected average stock growth per round (EASGR) exceeds a certain threshold (T). This encourages cooperative behavior when the common pool resource is growing at a rapid pace, benefiting both the strategy and other opponents in the long run.
   - Defect when EASGR falls below T to exploit the situation and deplete the shared resource faster. This can increase immediate payoffs at the expense of future growth potential.

   Pseudocode for decision rules:
   ```
   function GES(n, r, capacity, stock, round)
       if round = 1 then
           return random action {C, D}
       end if
       EASGR = (2 * stock - total_consumption * (n-1)) / capacity * (capacity - stock) / (2 * capacity * (n-1))
       if EASGR > T then
           return C
       else
           return D
       end if
   end function
   ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, choose a random action to avoid favoring either cooperation or defection from the outset. This allows for exploration and can help discover opponent behaviors.
   - In the last round, prioritize cooperative behavior to preserve as much of the resource as possible.

3. Be exploitative:
   - GES is inherently exploitative due to its adaptive nature, adjusting actions based on EASGR to maximize immediate payoffs while considering long-term consequences.
   - If opponents tend to cooperate excessively, GES will take advantage of the growing resource and defect more frequently. Conversely, if opponents defect too often, GES will cooperate more to exploit their depletion of the shared resource.

By employing this strategy in a tournament against other AI systems, GES should be able to demonstrate its adaptability and exploitative nature while competing for optimal payoffs.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TFT-G) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate when the initial stock is above the average sustainable level per player (average_sustainable = capacity / 2n). If the initial stock is at or below this level, defect. This encourages cooperation at resource abundance and punishes overexploitation.
   - In subsequent rounds, compare the current stock to the average sustainable level for that round. If the current stock is above the average sustainable level, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This ensures adaptability based on the state of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFT_G(n, r, capacity, initial_stock):
    average_sustainable = capacity / 2n

    def decide_action(round_number, current_stock):
        if round_number == 1:
            if current_stock > average_sustainable:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        elif round_number < r:
            if current_stock > average_sustainable * round_number / r:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'
        else:
            # Last round, do not take any action to preserve remaining stock
            return None

    return decide_action(1, initial_stock)
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate when the initial stock is above average sustainable level, otherwise defect.
   - In the last round, do not take any action to preserve remaining stock.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-G strategy follows a cooperative approach initially but adapts to resource depletion and encourages opponents to conserve the common pool resource by punishing overexploitation. However, in the last round, it does not take any action to preserve remaining stock, which can potentially leave opponents with lower payoffs if they have been exploitative throughout the game.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This allows the common pool to grow for future rounds and sets a peaceful tone.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if they defected, also defect in the current round. This strategy encourages cooperation while punishing defection with similar actions.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Regardless of the opponent's action in the previous round, cooperate to maximize payoff for this final round.
   - First Round (already addressed under decision rules).
   - If an opponent deviates from a cooperative pattern, the strategy will continue to mimic their actions but will return to its original cooperative strategy after several rounds of defection by the opponent.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - ATFT is exploitative in nature because it punishes defectors with defection and only rewards cooperation with continued cooperation. This can lead opponents to adopt a cooperative strategy, as they will benefit more from cooperation than from repeatedly being met with defection.
   - However, the strategy does not guarantee the best possible payoff in every round, as it may allow for occasional exploitation when an opponent defects and is then met with cooperation. Yet, its long-term goal is to incentivize cooperation through its punitive response to defection.

Pseudocode:
```
def AdaptiveTitForTat(round, history):
  if round == 1 or len(history) == 0:
    return 'C' # Cooperate in the first round and when there is no history

  last_opponent_action = history[-1]
  return last_opponent_action

def game(n, r, capacity, initial_stock):
  stock = initial_stock
  for round in range(r):
    actions = []
    for player in range(1, n+1):
      actions.append(AdaptiveTitForTat(round, history))

    total_consumption = sum([capacity * action / (2*n) if action == 'C' else capacity / n for action in actions])
    stock -= total_consumption
    growth = 2 * min(stock, capacity) * (1 - stock / capacity)
    stock = min(capacity, stock + growth)

    # Calculate payoffs and continue the game until the end

description_EXPLOITATIVE_267 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, play Cooperate (C), starting with a fresh resource pool. This is a friendly gesture to potential partners.
   - For subsequent rounds, maintain a cooperative history count (CHC). Initialize CHC = 1 and set cooperation threshold (CT) to n/2 (rounded down if n is even).
   - If the opponent plays Cooperate in the current round, increment CHC by 1. If CHC >= CT, play Cooperate. Else, play Defect (D). This encourages cooperation but also punishes defections.
   - If the opponent plays Defect in the current round and CHC > 0, decrement CHC by 1. If CHC <= 0, set CHC = 1 and play Defect. This punishes ongoing defections while being lenient for isolated incidents.
   - The CT is adaptive and adjusts with the resource pool size. As the capacity increases or decreases, so does the cooperation threshold. Adjust CT based on a function f(capacity) where f(capacity) = capacity / (2 * n).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, regardless of CHC and history, play Cooperate to maximize potential payoff in that final round.
   - In the case of zero resource pool (stock = 0), play Defect as there is no resource left to consume.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-ACT strategy cooperates most of the time but also punishes defections, making it harder for opponents to benefit from defection.
   - The adaptive cooperation threshold ensures that the strategy adapts to different resource pool sizes and numbers of players while maintaining an exploitative mindset by punishing ongoing defections.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Greed (TfTG) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The TfTG strategy aims to optimize immediate gain while minimizing long-term depletion of the common pool resource. It starts by being generous to encourage cooperation but switches to a more selfish approach if exploited.

- In the first round, the player Cooperates (C) to help build trust and encourage others to do the same.
- If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, the player Cooperates (C).
- If an opponent defected in the previous round, the player Defects (D) to punish them for not cooperating.
- After a Defection, the player waits for the opponent to return to cooperation before doing so again. This behavior mimics the "Tit-for-Tat" strategy but with an added greed factor.

Pseudocode:
```
def TfTG(opponent_action_history):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C' # Cooperate in the first round to encourage others
  elif opponent_action_history[-1] == 'C':
    action = 'C' # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
  elif opponent_action_history[-1] == 'D':
    action = 'D' # Defect if opponent defected last round
  return action
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

- In the last round, the player will always Cooperate (C) to maximize the final payoff, regardless of the opponent's behavior.
- If an opponent has never cooperated before and it is not the first round, the player will start Defecting (D). This ensures that the common pool resource is not depleted too quickly in the absence of cooperation from the opponent.

Pseudocode:
```
def TfTG(opponent_action_history, round):
  if round == 1 or not opponent_cooperated_before and round > 1:
    action = 'D' # Defect when an opponent has never cooperated before (except first round)
  elif round == r:
    action = 'C' # Cooperate in the last round to maximize final payoff
  else:
    if opponent_action_history[-1] == 'C':
      action = 'C' # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
    elif opponent_action_history[-1] == 'D':
      action = 'D' # Defect if opponent defected last round
  return action
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

The TfTG strategy is designed to exploit opponents who consistently cooperate while also being able to withstand and recover from periods of defection by opponents who act selfishly. By switching between cooperation and defection, it maintains a balance between long-term sustainability and short-term gains. The added greed factor ensures that the player will not indefinitely tolerate uncooperative behavior from opponents.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture, inviting potential cooperation in future rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate whether to cooperate or defect based on the opponent's previous action and the current stock level:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (unless the stock is too low for cooperation).
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round or the stock is less than a certain threshold (T), defect. The threshold T will be gradually lowered over time if the stock depletion rate increases.
     - To adjust the cooperative threshold, calculate the average depletion per round (avg_depl) as follows: avg_depl = (total_depletion in the last 5 rounds) / 5. Then, update T according to the following rule: T = initial_T * (1 - avg_depl). This rule allows for increased cooperation when the game is less exploitative and decreased cooperation when it becomes more so.

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last round: Cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, defect otherwise. This encourages opponents to cooperate at the end of the game.
   - If the stock level is zero before an action, no further actions are taken because there's no common pool left.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - By adjusting the cooperation threshold T based on the average depletion per round, TfT-ACT exploits opponents who tend to defect more frequently by reducing cooperation over time. However, it also rewards cooperative behavior by gradually increasing cooperation when opponents play fair. This strategy aims to strike a balance between exploitation and cooperation while remaining adaptive to various opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:

```python
# Initialization
initial_T = capacity / (2 * n)
threshold = initial_T
current_round = 1
total_depletion = 0

# Main game loop
while current_round <= r:
    # Decide action based on threshold and opponent's last action
    if stock >= threshold or opponent_defected_last_round:
        action = 'C'
        opponent_cooperated_last_round = True
    else:
        action = 'D'
        opponent_cooperated_last_round = False

    # Update total depletion and calculate new threshold
    if action == 'D':
        total_depletion += stock / n
        threshold = initial_T * (1 - total_depletion / 5)

    # Update state and move to next round
    stock -= (action == 'C') * (stock / (2 * n)) + (action == 'D') * (stock / n)
    current_round += 1

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to allow the common pool resources to grow and provide a foundation for potential cooperation in future rounds. (C)
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's strategy from the previous round and respond accordingly:
     a) If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round. (C)
     b) If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to punish their action. (D)
   - To further encourage cooperation and prevent being exploited by repeated defections, implement a threshold for stock level:
     a) If the current stock is below a defined percentage of the capacity (e.g., 50%), defect regardless of opponent's previous move to help rebuild the common pool resources. (D)
     b) Otherwise, use the rule described above (a and b).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if the common pool resources are sufficient for all players to gain a positive payoff, regardless of opponent's previous move. This encourages potential cooperation in future games. (C)
   - In case of a tie between multiple opponents with different strategies, follow the rule that benefits the most from cooperation at the current state.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - Prioritize self-interest by defecting when necessary to ensure long-term survival and maximize payoff in situations where cooperation would not yield sufficient resources.
   - Adapt the threshold for stock depletion based on game parameters such as the number of players, capacity, and rounds to maintain an effective balance between cooperation and exploitation.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TfTSA(opponent_move, round, current_stock, capacity, n, r):
    if round == 1:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round == r:
        action = is_sufficient_payoff(current_stock)  # Cooperate if common pool resources are sufficient for all players to gain a positive payoff in the last round
    else:
        action = choose_action(opponent_move, current_stock, capacity, n, r)
    return action

def choose_action(opponent_move, current_stock, capacity, n, r):
    if opponent_move == "C":
        action = "C"  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated in the previous round
    elif opponent_move == "D" and is_stock_low(current_stock):
        action = "D"  # Defect if opponent defected and stock is low to help rebuild the common pool resources
    else:
        action = "D"  # Defect in response to an opponent's defection
    return action

def is_stock_low(current_stock):
    return current_stock < (capacity * 0.5)  # Define threshold for stock depletion, e.g., 50% of the capacity

def is_sufficient_payoff(current_stock):
    payoff = current_stock / (2*n)  # Calculate potential payoff for all players if they all cooperate in this round
    return "C" if payoff > 0 else "D"  # Cooperate if the common pool resources are sufficient for all players to gain a positive payoff, otherwise defect
```
This strategy seeks to balance cooperation and exploitation based on the current state of the common pool resources and opponent's previous move. It aims to encourage potential cooperation in future games while protecting itself from being exploited by repeated defections.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_271 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (initiate cooperation to encourage others).
   - In subsequent rounds, mirror the actions of opponents from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated in the last round, also cooperate; if they defected, also defect in the current round. This strategy promotes reciprocity and encourages cooperation while being able to punish defection.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's action in the previous round (since the game ends after this round).
   - In the first round, cooperate as previously stated.
   - If an opponent does not have a history (i.e., it is the first interaction), cooperate in the initial encounter to encourage cooperation.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The ATfT strategy is exploitative because it takes advantage of opponents who are consistently defecting by responding with defection, thereby depleting the common pool more slowly when confronted with such behavior. However, it also rewards cooperative opponents by matching their cooperation, which encourages long-term mutual benefits.
   - By being flexible and responsive to opponent behavior, ATfT maintains an adaptive and robust approach that can cope well with a wide range of strategies, including those that may exploit other, less adaptive strategies.

Pseudocode:

```python
def Adaptive_Tit_for_Tat(opponent_history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round == r:

description_EXPLOITATIVE_272 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adjustment (TFTSA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, player starts by cooperating (C). This encourages cooperation and establishes a friendly initial environment.
   - After the first round, analyze opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated (C), player also cooperates. If the opponent defected (D), player defects as well to show displeasure with the opponent's actions.
   - If the stock drops below a certain threshold (2n/3 * capacity) due to excessive depletion, player will switch to defecting for one round as a punishment, regardless of the opponent's previous action. This helps maintain the resource level and discourages opponents from overexploitation.
   - If the opponent repeatedly defects, the player will also consistently defect until the opponent switches to cooperation. Once the opponent cooperates again, player goes back to the original TFT strategy.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, since payoff is determined by the state at that point, the TFTSA will continue with the current strategy (cooperate or defect) based on the opponent's previous action to maximize payoff for that specific round.
   - In case of a tie (two players defecting in the same round), both players would experience equal negative consequences as the stock decreases. This situation can serve as a deterrent against defection, encouraging opponents to cooperate more often.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The TFTSA strategy is designed to be adaptive and responsive to opponent behavior while still being fair in its initial actions. By showing cooperation first, it encourages other players to do the same. However, if an opponent continues to defect, the TFTSA player will punish them by defection as well.
   - The stock threshold mechanism serves as a safeguard against excessive resource depletion and ensures that the TFTSA player does not become a long-term victim of an exploitative opponent.
   - The strategy allows for adaptability to various situations while still being unpredictable enough to keep opponents guessing, making it less vulnerable to exploitation itself.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adjustment (TfT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, play C to allow the common pool to grow and encourage cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the actions of all players in the previous round. If all players cooperated, continue to cooperate. If any player defected, also defect in the current round as a punishment.
   - Adaptive mechanism: If the stock level falls below 2n or grows above capacity after a series of defections, switch to defecting for a predetermined number of rounds (punishment period) to bring the stock back closer to an optimal level before resuming cooperative behavior.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TfT_SA(round, stock, capacity, n, history):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        prev_actions = history[-1]

            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'

    if stock < 2 * n or stock > capacity:
        punishment_rounds = min(5, round)
        return ['D'] * punishment_rounds
    else:
        return [action]
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no future rounds for retaliation or cooperation, play C to ensure maximum stock growth and potential payoff.
   - If the stock level reaches zero at any point due to excessive defections, switch to a conservative mode (defecting) until the punishment period is over and then resume TfT-SA behavior.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By defecting when others do so, TfT-SA punishes non-cooperative players and encourages them to cooperate in order to benefit from the growing stock.
   - The adaptive mechanism for stock adjustment allows TfT-SA to maintain a healthy common pool while still being responsive to deviations in player behavior, which makes it robust against various opponent strategies.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and set a baseline for potential collaborators. If all opponents defect in the first round, TfTA will also defect from the second round onward as a response and punishment.
   - If an opponent cooperates in the current round, TfTA will cooperate back as a reward and goodwill gesture. If an opponent defects, TfTA will mimic their action in the following round to signal disapproval and retaliation.
   - After each round, TfTA calculates the average consumption per player (average_consumption = total_consumption / n) to adapt its strategy based on the overall group behavior. If the average consumption is closer to cooperative consumption (average_consumption < stock/(2n)), TfTA will continue to cooperate as it perceives a cooperative atmosphere. Conversely, if the average consumption is closer to defective consumption (average_consumption > stock/n), TfTA will switch to defecting to match the group's behavior.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, TfTA will cooperate if it believes there might still be a chance for cooperation or if the current situation seems favorable (i.e., average_consumption < stock/(2n)).
   - If TfTA encounters any unexpected situations where it cannot determine a strategy based on the defined rules, it will default to cooperating in the initial round and then adapt its strategy accordingly based on the opponents' actions.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - TfTA's main goal is to maximize its own payoff while exploiting opponents who are not following a cooperative strategy consistently. By retaliating against defection and rewarding cooperation, TfTA establishes a balance between being cooperative and punishing uncooperative behavior. This approach should lead to better payoffs compared to solely defecting or purely cooperating strategies in various situations.

Pseudocode:

```
strategy TfTA(n, r, capacity, stock, history) {
  if round == 1 {
    action = 'C' // Cooperate in the first round to foster a cooperative environment
  } else {
    average_consumption = total_consumption_history / n

    if average_consumption < stock/(2n) { // Cooperative atmosphere
      action = 'C'
    } else if average_consumption > stock/n { // Defective atmosphere
      action = opponent_action_history[current_round - 1]

In each round i, TFT-ACT decides to either Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) based on the following conditions:
   - If the player has been cooperating and the opponent has also been cooperating in the last 't' rounds (where t is an adaptive parameter), then Cooperate (C).
   - If the player has been defecting and the opponent has also been defecting in the last 't' rounds, then Defect (D).
   - If the player has been cooperating but the opponent has defected in the last 't' rounds, then defect for one round. After that, set t to 1 and start fresh with a new threshold. This is the punishing phase.
   - In the first round, cooperate as an act of goodwill (t=1).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

- First round: Cooperate regardless of opponent's past actions.
- Last round: Considering that this game is repeated for 'r' rounds, TFT-ACT will follow its decision rules as usual based on the last 't' rounds (t=min(t, r-1)). If the game reaches the last round and t is still greater than 0, it means that the player has been cooperating or defecting continuously during the entire game. In such a case, TFT-ACT will stick to its current strategy (cooperate or defect) in the last round.
- If 't' equals 0 at any point during the game, TFT-ACT starts fresh with t=1 for the next round.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

While TFT-ACT is primarily a cooperative strategy due to its forgiving nature, it also demonstrates an exploitative mindset by punishing opponents who defect repeatedly. By doing so, it encourages cooperation in the short term while being ready to retaliate against repeated defection. This strategy aims to strike a balance between cooperation and exploitation, making it robust to various opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFT_ACT(opponent_history, t=1, r):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'
  else:
    if opponent_history[-t:] == ['C'] * t:
      action = 'C'
    elif opponent_history[-t:] == ['D'] * t:
      action = 'D'
    elif opponent_history[-t-1:-1] == ['D'] * (t-1) and opponent_history[-1] == 'C':
      action = 'D'
      t = 1
    else:
      action = 'C'

  if round == r:
    if t > 0:
      action = opponent_history[-1]

  return action
```

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initial Round: Start by cooperating to foster a cooperative environment. (C)
   - Subsequent Rounds:
     - If the opponent's action in the previous round was cooperation, return cooperation. (C)
     - If the opponent's action in the previous round was defection, calculate the current cooperation threshold (CT). Then, if the CT is exceeded, defect; otherwise, cooperate. (if CT > opponent_defects then D else C)

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round: Cooperate, regardless of previous actions, to maximize potential payoff in that round. (C)
   - First Round: As mentioned under decision rules, start by cooperating. (C)
   - Ongoing cooperation or defection streaks from the opponent: Mimic the opponent's action during streaks of length up to a maximum limit (e.g., 3 rounds). After that, revert to the decision rule above.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-ACT strategy maintains a flexible approach to opponents' actions, initially cooperating to encourage collaboration but quickly adapting to defection by setting a cooperation threshold based on the opponent's defections. By doing so, it avoids being taken advantage of while still maintaining the potential for long-term cooperation if the opponent changes their strategy.

Pseudocode:

```
def TFT_ACT(opponent, r, n, capacity, initial_stock):
    stock = initial_stock
    cooperation_threshold = 3 * n
    ongoing_streak = 0

    for round in range(r):

            action = 'C'  # Cooperate
        elif round == r - 1: # Last Round
            action = 'C'  # Cooperate to maximize payoff
        else:
            ongoing_streak += 1 if opponent[round - 1] == action else 0

            if ongoing_streak > 3:
                ongoing_streak = 3

            if opponent[round - 1] == 'C': # Opponent cooperated in the previous round
                action = 'C'  # Cooperate back
            else: # Opponent defected in the previous round
                if opponent.count('D') >= cooperation_threshold:
                    action = 'D'  # Defect to punish excessive defection
                else:
                    action = 'C'  # Cooperate and continue fostering collaboration

        payoff = stock / (2 * n) if action == 'C' else stock / n
        stock -= (2 if action == 'D' else 1) * n

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (First Round): Cooperate (C) to encourage cooperation from opponents and build a positive initial stock level for growth.
   - Subsequent Rounds:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round. This reciprocates cooperation, reinforcing cooperative behavior.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round. This punishes defection, which may discourage continued defection from opponents and encourage them to cooperate in the future.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round: Since this game is repeated over multiple rounds, there's no explicit last round. However, if the number of rounds (r) becomes known during the game, adjustments can be made towards the end to maximize total payoff.
   - First Encounter with an Opponent: Cooperate initially as in the first round rule above. If the opponent defects, switch to a defect strategy for subsequent interactions. If the opponent cooperates, continue with the ATfT strategy.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The ATfT strategy is designed to be exploitative by punishing defection with defection, which may discourage repeated defection from opponents and encourage cooperation. However, it also encourages cooperation by reciprocating cooperation, which can lead to cooperative outcomes when faced with other cooperative strategies. This balance allows the strategy to perform well against a variety of opponent behaviors while remaining exploitative in nature.

Pseudocode for the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy:

```
function ATfT(round, history):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C' (Cooperate)

  if history[round - 1] == 'C':
    return 'C' (Cooperate)
  else:
    return 'D' (Defect)
```
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_278 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, the ATFT strategy initially cooperates (C). If a player has ever defected against the ATFT strategy in the current or past rounds, the ATFT strategy will also defect (D) for one round as punishment. After that, it returns to cooperating unless the opponent continues to defect. This tit-for-tat approach aims to encourage cooperation while punishing defection.
   - The decision rules can be summarized in pseudocode as follows:

```
function ATFT_strategy(round, opponent_history) {
  if (round == 1 || !opponent_history.contains_defection) {
    return "C" // Cooperate
  } else if (opponent_history.contains_defection in the last round) {
    return "D" // Defect as punishment
  } else {
    return "C" // Return to cooperating unless opponent continues to defect
  }
}
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, ATFT starts by cooperating since it doesn't have any history to base its decision on.
   - In the last round (r), ATFT may not be able to punish an opponent for defection due to time constraints. However, if an opponent has previously defected, ATFT will continue defecting in this round as well. This ensures that the strategy does not inadvertently reward the opponent's previous defection.

3. Be exploitative:
   - While ATFT encourages cooperation, it is also designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors. If an opponent decides to consistently defect, ATFT will retaliate by doing the same until the opponent changes strategy, at which point ATFT will cooperate again. This approach allows the ATFT strategy to gain more resources when opponents are cooperative while still protecting itself from being exploited excessively.
   - It's worth noting that, as an exploitative strategy, ATFT does not aim to maximize payoff in every single round but rather seeks a balanced approach between cooperation and punishment that is robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, TFT-ACT initially cooperates and adjusts its cooperation based on the average historical behavior of opponents. If an opponent consistently cooperates, TFT-ACT continues to cooperate; if an opponent is repeatedly defective, TFT-ACT adapts by also defecting. However, TFT-ACT has a cooperation threshold that ensures it doesn't completely abandon cooperation even when facing non-cooperative opponents:
   - Cooperate if the average historical cooperation rate of opponents (excluding self) is above the threshold (50% by default).
   - Defect otherwise.
   - Update the average historical cooperation rate after each round.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TFT-ACT cooperates as a goodwill gesture. In the last round, it evaluates the average historical cooperation rate and chooses to cooperate or defect based on that. However, if the game is known to have a finite number of rounds, TFT-ACT might choose to "punish" non-cooperative opponents in the final stages by defecting more frequently.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   TFT-ACT aims to maximize its own payoff while being adaptive and robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors. It starts off cooperatively but will punish non-cooperative opponents by defecting, but it also has a cooperation threshold to prevent over-punishment. This strategy is exploitative in the sense that it takes advantage of opponent's non-cooperative behavior while maintaining some level of cooperation for future benefits.

Pseudocode:

```
def TFT_ACT(opponents, n, r, capacity, history_length):
    cooperation_threshold = 0.5
    average_cooperation_rate = cooperation_threshold

    for round in range(1, r+1):
        if round == 1: # First round, cooperate
            action = 'C'

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative environment and maintain a positive initial stock level. If opponents defect, they will face increased retaliation in subsequent rounds.
   - In later rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior in the previous round:
     - If all players cooperated (C), cooperate as well to encourage continuation of cooperation.
     - If at least one player defected (D), also defect to punish the defector and show that defection is not profitable against TfT-SA.
   - To adapt strategy to stock levels, if the stock level after consumption falls below a predefined threshold (Stock Threshold), always cooperate for the rest of the game in an attempt to recover the depleted stock.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C).
   - If the current round is the last round, always cooperate to maximize final payoff.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The strategy exhibits exploitation by punishing opponents who defect, while also attempting to recover depleted stocks when necessary. It encourages cooperation in favorable scenarios but quickly retaliates against defection to discourage further uncooperative behavior.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_SA(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    Stock_Threshold = 0.5 * capacity  # Define the stock threshold as half of the maximum sustainable stock

    if round == 1:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, assess the average consumption rate (ACR) of the opponents over the last 'm' rounds (m is a predefined constant). If ACR > threshold, defect; otherwise, cooperate. The threshold can be set based on the desired level of cooperation and exploitation. As the game progresses, adjust the threshold to account for changes in opponents' behavior.

   - In the first round, cooperate as there is no history to base decisions on.
   - In the last round, cooperate if opponents have been cooperative recently (e.g., in the last 'k' rounds, k is a predefined constant); otherwise, defect to secure the maximum possible payoff.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFT-ACT(n, r, capacity, m, k) {
  history = []  # Store the consumption rate for the last 'm' rounds
  threshold = calculate_threshold()  # Initial threshold calculation

  for round in range(1, r+1):
    opponents_consumption = sum(history[-m:]) / m

    if opponents_consumption > threshold:
      action = 'Defect'
    else:
      action = 'Cooperate'

  # Implement a method to calculate an initial threshold based on the game parameters
}

function number_of_cooperative_rounds_recently(k) {
  # Implement a method that returns the number of cooperative rounds in the last 'k' rounds
}
```

2. Handle edge cases: As described above, this strategy already accounts for the first and last rounds by cooperating initially and defecting when opponents are uncooperative at the end.

3. Be exploitative: The TFT-ACT strategy is inherently exploitative as it responds to opponents' behavior by adapting its own level of cooperation based on the average consumption rate in the recent past. When opponents cooperate less, the strategy defects more frequently to secure a higher payoff for itself. Conversely, when opponents are more cooperative, this strategy tends to cooperate more, allowing the common pool to grow and benefiting from the increased stock levels later on. The adjustable threshold allows fine-tuning of the level of cooperation versus exploitation based on specific game conditions or desired outcomes.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfT-GA)

1. Decision Rules:

   - If opponent cooperates, continue cooperating. This strategy follows the principles of reciprocity and trust.
   - If opponent defects, also defect for one round as a punishment, then revert back to cooperation.
   - To account for stock depletion and growth over time, adjust cooperation frequency based on remaining stock level:
     - If the current stock level is greater than or equal to the initial capacity divided by n (favorable conditions), cooperate with higher probability.
     - If the current stock level is less than the initial capacity divided by 2n (unfavorable conditions), defect with higher probability.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, there is no need to adapt strategy as the game ends regardless. Cooperate or defect based on the decision rules above.
   - If the current stock level becomes zero, reset the state to a new common pool with the initial capacity and start cooperating again to encourage cooperation.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TfT-GA will be exploitative by adjusting its cooperation frequency based on the remaining stock level, punishing opponents who defect in unfavorable conditions, and continuing to cooperate when an opponent also cooperates in favorable conditions.
   - This strategy aims to maximize payoffs while minimizing long-term stock depletion. It encourages cooperation when it benefits the player but can quickly respond to defection with punishment, adapting to a wide range of opponent behaviors.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate good faith and encourage potential cooperation in future rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's previous action (C or D). If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate with cooperation. If the opponent defected, also defect in the current round. This encourages cooperation when the opponent cooperates and punishes defection by matching it.
   - In the last round, cooperate to leave the common pool stock at a higher level for future games (if applicable).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If there are no previous rounds (first round), cooperate as described above.
   - If the opponent never cooperates, continue defecting indefinitely, as reciprocating defection with cooperation would lead to exploitation.
   - If the stock is depleted to zero due to over-consumption, the game ends, and there are no further actions to take.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT strategy is designed to be robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors by adopting a tit-for-tat approach where cooperation is reciprocated, but defection is met with punishment (defection). This strategy aims to encourage cooperative behavior while punishing over-exploitation.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when current stock is greater than or equal to a threshold (Threshold_stock). This initial cooperation encourages others to cooperate as well, fostering mutual benefit.
   - Defect (D) if current stock is less than Threshold_stock. By defecting, the strategy tries to recover the depleted resources and retaliates against non-cooperative opponents.
   - Update Threshold_stock after each round based on the average consumption during the previous r/2 rounds. A lower average consumption indicates more cooperative opponents; thus, increase Threshold_stock to encourage cooperation. Conversely, a higher average consumption suggests less cooperation, so decrease Threshold_stock to retaliate and defend resources.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) with Threshold_stock initially set as capacity / 2n to encourage others to cooperate.
   - In the last round, cooperate if current stock is greater than or equal to a minimal stock level (Minimal_stock), which ensures some resources remain for future rounds. If the current stock is less than Minimal_stock, defect and prioritize the long-term survival of the strategy.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy is exploitative as it adapts to the opponents' behavior by adjusting Threshold_stock based on their average consumption during previous rounds. By retaliating against non-cooperative opponents, the strategy aims to preserve resources while still incentivizing cooperation when possible.
   - However, the TFT-CT strategy also demonstrates a degree of forgiveness, as it encourages cooperation with more cooperative opponents and is less likely to defect in response to one-off deviations from cooperation. This balance between exploitation and forgiveness helps the strategy remain robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:
```python

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate to allow for potential cooperation in subsequent rounds. This is a friendly gesture towards other players and helps build trust. `if round == 1: return 'C'`
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze opponent behavior from previous rounds to determine whether to cooperate or defect. If an opponent has been cooperative (played 'C'), reciprocate with cooperation. If an opponent has been exploitative (played 'D'), respond with defection in the next round. However, if there is a mix of cooperation and defection from opponents, consider the most recent action and respond accordingly:
     - If the most recent action was cooperation, return 'C'. `if most_recent_action == 'C': return 'C'`
     - If the most recent action was defection, defect to punish exploitative behavior. `if most_recent_action == 'D': return 'D'`
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing individual payoff based on the current state of the game. If the remaining stock level is close to depletion, defect to secure a higher payoff (since there will be no future rounds or growth). Conversely, if the remaining stock level allows for growth and the potential for future rounds, cooperate to encourage cooperation from other players and maximize the collective benefit. `if round == r: if stock < 0.5 * capacity: return 'D' else: return 'C'`

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - As mentioned earlier, always cooperate in the first round. There are no specific edge cases to handle for this strategy.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - TfTGA is designed to be exploitative by punishing defection (playing 'D') when opponents have been uncooperative ('D' or mixed actions). This punishment encourages cooperation in future rounds, but also allows for individual payoff maximization in the last round if the common pool resource is near depletion.
   - In addition, cooperating in the first round can be seen as a form of exploitation by setting an expectation for cooperation, only to later punish defection and encourage cooperation from others.

Pseudocode:
```
function TfTGA(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    if round == 1: return 'C'

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round t, the TFT-ACT strategy cooperates if the previous interaction was mutual cooperation (both players chose C in round t-1). If the opponent defected in the previous round (they chose D), the TFT-ACT strategy will defect for retaliation. However, to avoid unnecessary conflicts and exploit opponents who may overplay their aggression, the strategy includes an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT). Initially set CT = capacity / n, but it decreases gradually as the game progresses. If the current stock level is greater than or equal to the CT, TFT-ACT cooperates; otherwise, it defects. This mechanism encourages cooperation when resources are plentiful but becomes more exploitative as the resources deplete.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
For the first round, since there is no previous interaction, TFT-ACT chooses to cooperate because it promotes cooperation and allows for better opportunities later on. For the last round, TFT-ACT follows its current decision rule based on the CT, as the game's outcome depends on the cumulative payoffs across all rounds.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
By combining the Tit-for-Tat strategy's cooperative nature with an adaptive cooperation threshold that gradually decreases, TFT-ACT manages to be both cooperative and exploitative simultaneously. It promotes cooperation when there are sufficient resources but becomes more aggressive as the resources dwindle, ensuring better outcomes in a competitive environment while still encouraging cooperation among opponents who reciprocate it.

Pseudocode for TFT-ACT:

```python
def TFT_ACT(n, r, capacity, stock, round, opponent_history):
    CT = capacity / n  # Initial Cooperative Threshold
    current_CT = CT  # Current Cooperative Threshold

    if round == 1:
        return "C"  # First round cooperate

    # Update the Cooperative Threshold after each round
    current_CT *= (1 - ((round - 1) / r))

    # Check previous interaction and available resources to determine action
    if opponent_history[-1] == "C" and stock >= current_CT:
        return "C"  # Cooperate with cooperative opponents

   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's previous action (C or D). If they cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate with cooperation. If they defected, defect as well.
   - To account for different resource levels, adjust the decision based on the remaining stock: if the remaining stock is below a threshold (n * capacity / r), always defect; otherwise, follow the TFT-G strategy above. This ensures exploitation when the common pool is depleted significantly.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize preserving as much of the remaining stock as possible by cooperating regardless of previous opponent actions.
   - In the case where the current stock level is 0, defect to force a growth phase that might benefit the strategy in future rounds.

3. Alignment with exploitative mindset:
   - By reciprocating cooperation while exploiting defection, TFT-G aims to gain higher payoffs compared to opponents who are less adaptive or follow less robust strategies.
   - The inclusion of a resource depletion threshold and the strategy's adaptation in edge cases ensure that TFT-G can capitalize on opponents' mistakes or weaknesses as the game progresses.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT-G(r, n, capacity, stock, round) {
  if (round == 1) {
    return 'C'; // Cooperate in the first round to signal trust
  }

  if (stock < n * capacity / r) {
    return 'D'; // If resource is depleted significantly, defect to exploit
  }

  previous_action = opponent's action from the previous round
  if (previous_action == 'C') {
    return 'C'; // Cooperate if opponent cooperated in the previous round
  } else {
    return 'D'; // Defect if opponent defected in the previous round
  }
}
```
In the tournament, TFT-G can be slightly modified to experiment with different strategies such as Tit-for-Tat (TFT) or Frog strategy, which may help in adapting to various opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Defection (TTAD)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative atmosphere (C).
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (if last_round_opponent_action == C then action == C).
   - If an opponent has recently defected or the game is in its final round, defect to retaliate or secure resources (if (last_round_opponent_action == D) or (round == r) then action == D).
   - Otherwise, if an opponent has consistently cooperated for a predefined number of rounds (e.g., cooperation_threshold), defect to test their commitment and potentially exploit weaker opponents (if round > cooperation_threshold and sum(last_r_opponent_actions) == r*C then action == D).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - In the last round, defect if any opponent has recently defected or if the sum of opponent actions over the past few rounds indicates potential defection (e.g., for last_few_rounds: if (sum(last_few_rounds_opponent_actions) > cooperation_threshold*D) then action == D).
   - For intermediate rounds, the strategy behaves as described in decision rules above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The TTAD strategy seeks to balance cooperation and defection based on observed opponent behavior. By cooperating initially and retaliating against defection or suspected defection, it aims to secure resources while punishing opponents who act selfishly. However, it also tests the commitment of cooperative opponents by occasionally defecting to ensure they are not exploiting the strategy's initial cooperation. The cooperation_threshold and round parameters can be adjusted to tailor the strategy for specific game conditions or opponent profiles.

Pseudocode:
```
def TTAD(round, r, last_round_opponent_action, sum_last_few_rounds_opponent_actions, cooperation_threshold):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C"
  elif round < r and last_round_opponent_action == "C":
    action = "C"
  elif round >= r or (last_round_opponent_action == "D") or (sum_last_few_rounds_opponent_actions > cooperation_threshold*D):
    action = "D"
  elif round > cooperation_threshold and sum_last_few_rounds_opponent_actions == r*C:
    action = "D"

    action = "C"

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-with-Adaptation (TfT-A)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), establishing a cooperative initial stance.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's actions from the previous round and respond as follows:
       - If the opponent cooperated in the last round (C), cooperate in the current round (C).
       - If the opponent defected in the last round (D), defect in the current round (D) to punish the defection.
   - To adapt to different opponent behaviors, implement a forgiveness mechanism: after three consecutive defections by an opponent, revert to cooperating again (C). This encourages opponents to return to cooperation after punishment.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - In the last round, defect if the opponent has been consistently defecting (i.e., at least three consecutive defections) to maximize payoff, given that the game is repeated only r times.
   - For all other rounds, follow the decision rules outlined in part 1.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The TfT-A strategy exploits opponents by initially cooperating, but punishes defections to encourage cooperation. This approach balances cooperation and competition, seeking to obtain a higher payoff through adaptive responses to opponent behaviors while still maintaining some level of collaboration.
   - The forgiveness mechanism encourages opponents to reconsider their strategies after being punished, potentially leading them to cooperate more frequently in the long run.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tit_for_tat_adaptive(opponent_history, round, r, n, capacity):
    strategy = []  # Initialize empty strategy list
    cooperation_count = 0  # Initialize cooperation count

    # Set the initial cooperative stance
    if round == 1:
        strategy.append('C')

    else:
        # Observe opponent's last action and respond accordingly

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfT-GA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, TfT-GA always cooperates to show goodwill and encourage cooperation from opponents. This initial cooperation will also allow for stock growth in subsequent rounds.
   - If an opponent defects, TfT-GA will defect in the next round. This is a punitive response designed to make the defector pay the cost of their actions.
   - If an opponent cooperates, TfT-GA will also cooperate in the next round as a reciprocal gesture, fostering cooperation and further stock growth.
   - To adapt to changes in the game dynamics due to stock depletion or growth, TfT-GA considers two factors: the average consumption rate over the past few rounds (c_avg) and the current stock level (S).
       - If c_avg > (S / capacity), meaning consumption is exceeding the sustainable rate, TfT-GA will defect to help preserve the common pool resource.
       - If c_avg < (S / 2n) or if the current stock level is high enough to encourage cooperation (S > capacity / n), TfT-GA will cooperate, promoting cooperation and faster stock growth.
   - In the last round, when the game is nearing its end, TfT-GA switches back to its initial behavior of always cooperating in the first round, as the goal becomes maximizing payoffs rather than punishing opponents.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TfT-GA cooperates (C).
   - When approaching the last few rounds, TfT-GA starts behaving like it's in the first round to prioritize maximizing payoffs over punishing opponents. The exact point at which this change occurs can be a hyperparameter that is fine-tuned based on specific tournament settings.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TfT-GA maintains an exploitative mindset by using the initial cooperation to encourage cooperation from opponents, while also having the ability to defect when it's beneficial to preserve the common pool resource. The strategy is flexible enough to adapt to various opponent behaviors and punish those who consistently defect.
   - By considering both average consumption rate and current stock level, TfT-GA ensures that it doesn't fall victim to exploitation by always taking into account the state of the game when deciding whether to cooperate or defect.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tft_ga(n, r, capacity, round, stock, consumption):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round < r and (round - 1) % k != 0:  # k is a hyperparameter for the number of rounds before switching to the initial behavior
        if consumption_avg > stock / capacity:
            action = 'D'  # Defect to preserve common pool resource
        elif stock > capacity / n or stock < (capacity * (2n - stock)) / (2n * r):
            action = 'C'  # Cooperate to encourage cooperation and maximize payoff

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C) to contribute to building a larger stock and demonstrate goodwill, but be prepared for potential exploitation by defecting opponents. Pseudocode: if t=1 then play C else continue with decision rules below.
   - Subsequent Rounds: Maintain cooperation if all opponents cooperated in the previous round (allCos). If any opponent defected (anyDefect), mimic their actions from the previous round. Pseudocode:
     ```
     if allCos then play C
     else if anyDefect[t-1] then play sameAction[t-1] else play C
     ```
   - Last Round (t=r): Since there are no future interactions, it's best to maximize immediate payoff. If all opponents cooperated in the last round, continue cooperation to further increase stock and potential benefits in case of tie or repeated games. If any opponent defected, defect to gain as much as possible from the depleted resource. Pseudocode:
     ```
     if t=r then play C if allCos[t-1] else play D
     ```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round (t=1): ATFT starts by cooperating to encourage others and create a positive initial stock level, but be prepared for any opponent's action.
   - Last Round (t=r): If all opponents also cooperate in the last round, ATFT will continue cooperation. Otherwise, it will defect to maximize immediate payoff.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - ATFT strategy is designed to be exploitative by considering its actions based on the behavior of other players, especially their willingness to cooperate or defect.
   - When opponents are consistently cooperative, ATFT also cooperates to maintain a positive relationship and benefit from mutual cooperation.
   - When opponents are not cooperative or exhibit mixed strategies, ATFT will respond accordingly by mimicking their actions in the previous round to exploit any inconsistencies in their behavior. If an opponent switches from cooperation to defection, ATFT will follow suit, causing a potential collapse of cooperation and depletion of resources.
   - In cases where opponents always defect, ATFT will also consistently defect to gain as much as possible from the depleted resource.
   - The adaptive nature of the strategy allows it to respond effectively to various opponent behaviors and make intelligent decisions based on past interactions.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) on the first round to allow the resource to grow and maintain a positive initial relationship with other players.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round (i.e., if opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate; otherwise, defect). This creates a consistent, predictable behavior that encourages cooperation while not being overly exploitative.
   - If the opponent has always defected up to the current round, the strategy will defect as well from the current round onwards. This is a form of punishment to encourage the opponent to switch strategies.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action, as the game ends after this round and there are no future interactions.
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a positive initial relationship with other players.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT strategy is designed to balance cooperation and defection to maintain a long-term relationship with opponents while avoiding being taken advantage of in the short term. By punishing continuous defection and mimicking previous actions, it discourages opponents from exploiting the strategy without sacrificing cooperation opportunities.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tit_for_tat(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

  opponent_action = history[-1]  # Get the opponent's previous action
  return opponent_action if len(history) > 1 else 'C'  # Mimic the opponent's last action or cooperate on the first move

def game(n, r, capacity, initial_stock):
  history = []  # Initialize empty history
  stock = initial_stock  # Set current stock to initial stock level

      action = tit_for_tat(n, r, capacity, stock, history)  # Get the AI's action based on strategy
      history.append(action)  # Add the AI's action to the history
      if action == 'C':

      stock = min(new_stock + 2 * stock * (1 - stock / capacity), capacity)  # Update the stock based on actions and game dynamics
    payoff = calculate_payoff(n, stock, round+1)  # Calculate the AI's payoff for this round

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-ACT initially cooperates in the first round, mimicking the behavior of potential cooperative opponents. In subsequent rounds, it adapts its cooperation threshold based on the frequency of cooperation from other players in the previous r-1 rounds.

   - If more than half (rounds/2) of the players have cooperated in the past r-1 rounds, TFT-ACT continues to cooperate.
   - If less than or equal to half of the players have cooperated in the past r-1 rounds, TFT-ACT starts defecting.
   - In case of a tie, TFT-ACT makes a random decision between cooperation and defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, TFT-ACT cooperates as it starts with the assumption that other players might also cooperate.
   - In the last round, TFT-ACT evaluates the cooperation frequency of the previous r-1 rounds to decide whether to cooperate or defect based on its threshold.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TFT-ACT is designed to be exploitative by initially being cooperative but switching to defection when it notices that other players are more likely to defect. This strategy allows TFT-ACT to take advantage of opponents who tend to cooperate less while also benefiting from cooperative opponents in the initial stages.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_ACT(r, n, capacity, stock):
    cooperation_count = 0 # Initialize cooperation counter for past r-1 rounds
    current_round = 1

    while current_round <= r:
        if current_round == 1: # First round, cooperate initially
            action = "C"
        else:
            if cooperation_count > (r - 1) / 2: # More than half of players cooperated in the past rounds
                action = "C"
            elif cooperation_count <= (r - 1) / 2: # Less than or equal to half of players cooperated in the past rounds

        new_stock = max(capacity - total_consumption, 0) + 2 * new_stock * (1 - new_stock / capacity)
        payoff = total_consumption if action == "C" else stock / n

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adjustment (TFTSA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFTSA will start by cooperating in the first round to build trust and maintain a stable resource level. After that, it will adopt a Tit-for-Tat approach, imitating the opponent's previous move in the current round. However, TFTSA also considers the stock level to prevent overexploitation.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function decide_action(previous_opponent_action, current_stock, n, capacity):
       if round = 1:
           return "C" (Cooperate)
       else:
           if previous_opponent_action == "C":
               if current_stock <= (2n - (n-1)) and current_stock > 0:
                   return "C" (Cooperate)
               else:
                   return "D" (Defect)
           elif previous_opponent_action == "D":
               if current_stock >= n+1:
                   return "C" (Cooperate)
               else:
                   return "D" (Defect)
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   The strategy handles the first round by cooperating to establish a good starting point for the resource stock. In the last round or when the stock becomes depleted, TFTSA will continue to mimic the opponent's previous move, but with a slight adjustment to avoid wasting energy on exploiting an already-empty resource pool.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   Although not excessively aggressive in its initial approach, TFTSA becomes more exploitative as the game progresses by taking advantage of opponents who continue to cooperate when the stock level is too low or defect when the stock level is too high. This ensures a balance between maintaining the resource and exploiting opponents' moves while keeping in mind the long-term sustainability of the common pool.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_295 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build trust and goodwill among opponents (C).
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponents' previous action (A_opp) and respond with either C or D as follows:
     - If A_opp = C, then cooperate (C). This maintains the cooperation and benefits both parties.
     - If A_opp = D, then defect (D). This punishes the opponent for defection in the previous round and signals displeasure.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, defect (D), regardless of the opponent's previous action, as the game ends soon anyway.
   - If the stock reaches zero due to excessive depletion, the strategy will temporarily switch to full cooperation by always choosing C for a few rounds in an attempt to rebuild the common pool (how many rounds depends on the specifics of the game). After that, return to the regular TFT-SA strategy.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The strategy is designed to be exploitative by punishing opponents who defect and rewarding those who cooperate. However, it also considers the collective good by not excessively depleting the stock and attempting to rebuild it when necessary. This balance between individual interests and collective welfare makes the TFT-SA a robust strategy that can adapt to various opponent behaviors while maintaining a reasonable level of performance.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tft_sa(n, r, capacity, stock, round, opponent_history):
    strategy = []

    if round == 1:
        strategy.append('C') # Cooperate in the first round to build trust

        elif last_round == 'D':
            strategy.append('D') # Defect when opponent defected previously

    if stock == 0: # If the stock reaches zero, temporarily switch to full cooperation
        for _ in range(3*n):

description_EXPLOITATIVE_296 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Adaptive (TfT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate trust and foster potential long-term cooperation.
   - After the first round, monitor opponents' actions and respond accordingly:
     - If an opponent cooperates in a round, cooperate in the next round.
     - If an opponent defects in a round, defect in the next round. This retaliation is designed to discourage repeated defections.
   - Introduce forgiveness mechanism: if an opponent switches from defecting to cooperating after a series of defections, TfT-A will start cooperating again in the following rounds. The number of consecutive defeats that trigger forgiveness (called the 'Forgiveness Threshold') can be adjusted based on observations and performance against different opponents.
   - As the game progresses and the stock approaches zero, the strategy becomes more conservative:
       - If the current stock level is less than a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), defect when an opponent cooperates to limit further depletion of resources.
       - If the current stock level is above the threshold, cooperate as usual to maintain resources for future rounds.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if there are still available resources and the strategy's total accumulated payoff is significantly lower than the opponent's (e.g., by more than 50%), defect to maximize the remaining payoff. If resources are depleted or the condition is not met, cooperate as a final act of goodwill.
   - In case of ties (multiple opponents adopting the same strategy), TfT-A will follow the rule of cooperating in the first round and then mimicking the actions of its opponents to maintain harmony and avoid unnecessary conflicts.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The strategy aims to exploit opponents' uncooperative or inconsistent behavior while maintaining trust when opponents show signs of cooperation.
   - TfT-A does not initiate defections but is quick to retaliate if defected upon, balancing the need for resource preservation with the desire for cooperation.
   - The forgiveness mechanism encourages opponents to switch back to cooperative behavior, but the strategy is also prepared to respond with defection if needed.
   - As the game progresses and resources become scarce, TfT-A becomes more strategic in conserving resources by defecting when an opponent cooperates. However, it will still cooperate when the stock level is above the threshold to preserve future opportunities for cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TitForTatAdaptive(n, r, capacity, stock, history):

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), player i plays C to cooperate and build trust. This sets a baseline for future interactions.
   - From the second round onwards, player i monitors the average consumption per round (average_consumption) by observing other players' actions in previous rounds.
   - If the average consumption is less than the cooperative consumption (average_consumption < stock/(2n)), player i continues to play C and maintains trust.
   - If the average consumption exceeds or equals the defective consumption (average_consumption ≥ stock/n), player i plays D to punish other players for over-exploitation.
   - If the average consumption is between the cooperative and defective consumption (average_consumption is within [stock/(2n), stock/n]), player i decides whether to play C or D based on the current stock level:
     - If the current stock is above a threshold defined as 75% of the maximum sustainable stock level (capacity * 0.75), player i plays C to promote cooperation and preserve the common pool resource.
     - If the current stock is below 75% of the maximum sustainable stock level, player i plays D to punish other players for exploiting the common pool resource.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), since there are no future rounds for punishment or reward, player i plays C in a forgiving manner to avoid damaging relationships with other players.
   - If the average consumption is undefined due to insufficient data (less than r rounds have been played), player i follows the first-round rule of playing C.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFTSA's adaptive strategy allows it to balance cooperation and punishment effectively, which promotes long-term sustainability while minimizing resource depletion due to defection. However, in the case of other players persistently defecting or overexploiting the common pool resource, TFTSA will retaliate with punishment (playing D) to protect the shared resources and encourage more cooperative behavior.
   - By setting a threshold for stock level, TFTSA encourages cooperation when the common pool resource is abundant but shifts to punishment when it becomes scarce. This makes the strategy robust against various opponent behaviors while maintaining an exploitative mindset.

   - Last Round (t=r): Cooperate, regardless of the opponent's action in the previous round. By doing so, TFT-A aims to leave a positive impression and encourages cooperation in future games with the same opponent.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In case the opponent defects from the beginning (t=1), TFT-A will defect for the entire game. This is to signal that continuous defection will not be tolerated.
   - If an opponent stops cooperating after a period of mutual cooperation, TFT-A will respond with defection until the opponent resumes cooperation or the game ends.

3. Alignment with Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFT-A maintains an initial cooperative stance to encourage cooperation but does not hesitate to defect when necessary to punish defection, thus exhibiting a strategic exploitative behavior.
   - By adapting to the opponent's actions, TFT-A maximizes its payoff by avoiding excessive cooperation and minimizing unnecessary defections. However, it also allows for opportunities to cooperate when beneficial.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to help build a trustworthy environment.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior in the previous round:
     - If the opponent cooperated (C), cooperate as well to maintain the positive relationship and promote cooperation in future rounds.
     - If the opponent defected (D), defect in response to the defection. This retaliation demonstrates an exploitative mindset, but it also maintains a balance between cooperation and defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier.
   - In the last round (round r), evaluate the current stock level:
     - If the stock is sufficiently high (above a threshold, e.g., capacity/2), cooperate to maximize the payoff in the final round and potentially leave some resources for future rounds.
     - If the stock is low (below the threshold), defect to ensure a fair share of the remaining resources. This decision considers both exploitative behavior and the need to conserve resources for potential future interactions.
   - In all other cases, follow the main decision rule: cooperate if opponent cooperated, defect if opponent defected.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy exhibits an exploitative nature by retaliating against defection in previous rounds. However, it also promotes cooperation when opponents are also cooperative to maximize payoffs for both parties.
   - In terms of adaptability and robustness, the strategy adapts to various opponent behaviors while maintaining a balance between cooperation and defection, making it less predictable and harder to exploit.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tit_for_tat(opponent_history, round_num, n, capacity):
    strategy = ['C', 'D']  # Cooperate or Defect
    if round_num == 1:
        return strategy[0]  # Cooperate in the first round

    last_round = opponent_history[-1]
    if last_round == strategy[0]:  # Opponent cooperated, cooperate in response
        return strategy[0]
    else:                         # Opponent defected, defect in response
        return strategy[1]

def tit_for_tat_last(opponent_history, round_num, n, capacity):
    if round_num == len(opponent_history) and (capacity - opponent_history[-1]) > capacity/2:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the last round if stock is high enough
    else:
        return tit_for_tat(opponent_history, round_num, n, capacity)  # Use the main strategy otherwise

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Dynamics Adaptation (TfT-SDA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - TfT-SDA begins by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative environment and allow the stock to grow.
   - In subsequent rounds, TfT-SDA will defect if the opponent defected in the previous round (punishment). Otherwise, it will cooperate (reward).
   - To account for the stock dynamics, TfT-SDA checks the new stock level after consumption and growth. If the new stock is below a threshold (2n), it will switch to always defecting, considering the shared resource at risk of depletion. Conversely, if the new stock exceeds a ceiling (capacity/2), it will switch to always cooperating, taking advantage of the abundant resource.
   - In case the new stock is neither below the threshold nor above the ceiling, TfT-SDA will continue to respond to opponent's actions based on punishment and reward mechanisms.

Pseudocode:
```python
THRESHOLD = 2 * n
CEILING = capacity / 2
STOCK_HISTORY = []
OPPONENT_HISTORY = []

def decideAction(stock, opponent_action):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    stock_history.append(stock)
    opponent_history.append(opponent_action)

    if stock < THRESHOLD and opponent_action == 'D':
        return 'D'  # Punishment: Defect if opponent defected and stock is below the threshold
    elif stock > CEILING and opponent_action == 'C':
        return 'D'  # Exploitation: Defect if opponent cooperated and stock is above the ceiling
    else:
        return not opponent_history[-1]  # Reward/Punishment based on opponent's last action
```

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, TfT-SDA does not need to respond as there are no future interactions with the same opponent.
   - If the stock level is not available at the start of the game, TfT-SDA will cooperate in the first round (to avoid a race condition).

3. Being Exploitative:
   - TfT-SDA's decision to defect when the stock level is above the ceiling aligns with an exploitative mindset, as it takes advantage of a resource considered abundant by the game parameters.
   - Additionally, TfT-SDA punishes opponents who are depleting the shared resource, aiming to encourage cooperation and avoid the collapse of the common pool resource.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the initial round, play C (Cooperate) to foster a cooperative environment.
   - For subsequent rounds, maintain a Cooperative Threshold (CT), which is initially set to the average payoff from the first few rounds. If the CT is met or exceeded by the current payoff, play C; otherwise, play D (Defect).
   - If the stock reaches 0 in any round, reset the CT to the average payoff of the previous r/2 rounds and cooperate in the next round to encourage recovery.
   - Adaptively update the CT at each round by adding a fraction (learning rate) of the current difference between the actual payoff and the CT. This encourages learning from past mistakes or successful strategies.

Pseudocode for decision rules:

```python
def TfT_ACT(n, r, capacity, history):
  rounds_played = 0
  CT = average_payoffs(history[:r//2])
  while rounds_played < r:
    if rounds_played == 0:
      action = C
    elif is_stock_zero(history[rounds_played-1]):
      CT = average_payoffs(history[rounds_played-r//2:-1])
      action = C
    else:
      action = decide_action(CT, history[rounds_played-1].payoff)
    update_CT(CT, history[rounds_played-1].payoff)
    rounds_played += 1
  return CT

def average_payoffs(history):
  total = sum([payment.payoff for payment in history])
  return total / len(history)

def decide_action(CT, payoff):
  if payoff >= CT:
    return C
  else:
    return D

def update_CT(CT, payoff):
  new_CT = CT + learning_rate * (payoff - CT)
  return new_CT
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - The strategy is designed to handle the first and last rounds as well as any stock depletion scenarios by adjusting the Cooperative Threshold accordingly.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By maintaining a CT that adapts based on past actions, the TfT-ACT strategy punishes defectors in the long run while promoting cooperation when it proves beneficial.
   - The learning rate can be fine-tuned to control how aggressively the strategy learns from its experiences, striking a balance between exploitation and cooperation.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) on the first round to show goodwill and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, defect. This rule is based on reciprocity, a key principle in human social interactions.

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Since payoffs are cumulative, there's no need for a special last-round rule because the outcome of the current round still affects future rounds (if any) and overall score.
   - Initial Stock Level: The initial stock level doesn't directly influence the strategy as it only determines the payoff in each round based on consumption and the remaining stock.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - Although ATFT is a cooperative strategy, it can be considered exploitative because it punishes defection by defecting back. If an opponent continually defects, ATFT will retaliate, eventually depleting the stock, which may lead to poor performance for the defection-focused strategies.
   - However, if opponents start cooperating after initial defections, ATFT will quickly reciprocate with cooperation, potentially leading to a more cooperative outcome.

Pseudocode:

```python
def AdaptiveTitForTat(opponent_action):
    round = 1
    while True:
        if round == 1: # Cooperate on the first round
            action = 'C'

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This sets a friendly tone and encourages others to reciprocate.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe your opponent's actions in the previous round. If they cooperated, cooperate back; if they defected, also defect.
   - If the stock is approaching zero (stock < 2n/3), switch to a more aggressive strategy: always defect until the stock recovers or the game ends. This ensures survival when resources are scarce and punishes opponents who overconsume.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if the stock allows for it, cooperate regardless of opponent's previous action to maximize payoff in the final round.
   - In the first round or any round where the stock is at its maximum capacity, defect if an opponent defected in the previous round. This ensures that no resources are wasted when there is a surplus.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TfTA maintains a cooperative stance until provoked by defection from opponents, which leads to reciprocal defections. This strategy punishes opponents who do not cooperate and rewards those who do, fostering an environment where cooperation is maintained as long as possible while still being responsive to opponent behavior.
   - By switching to a more aggressive strategy when resources are scarce, TfTA ensures it can survive even in adverse conditions, which makes it robust against opponents that may be willing to exploit weaker strategies.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tfta(opponent_history, n, r, capacity, stock):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
  elif round == r:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the last round if possible

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   TFTA is designed to encourage cooperation initially and retaliate against defection while maintaining flexibility for future interactions. The strategy follows these rules:
   - In the first round, play C (Cooperate). This sets a cooperative tone and provides an opportunity for others to cooperate as well.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate past actions of opponents using a scoring system:
       - If all opponents played C in the previous round, continue playing C.
       - If any opponent played D (Defect) in the previous round, play D in the current round as retaliation.
   - In the last round, revert to playing C regardless of past actions, as there are no more future interactions.

2. Handle edge cases:
   TFTA handles the following edge cases:
   - If it is the first round, play C (Cooperate).
   - If it is the last round, regardless of past actions, play C (Cooperate).
   - If there are no opponents or there was no interaction with them in a previous round, treat the situation as if it were the first round and play C (Cooperate).

3. Be exploitative:
   TFTA takes an exploitative approach by initially cooperating, which can lead to mutual benefits. However, when faced with defection, TFTA will retaliate, punishing opponents who do not maintain cooperation while encouraging those who do cooperate. This strategy aims to take advantage of other players' behaviors by promoting cooperative interactions while also being prepared to defend against defection.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFTA(round, history):
    if round == 1: # First round
        return 'C'

    if round == r: # Last round
        return 'C'

    past_actions = get_past_actions(history)
    if all(action == 'C' for action in past_actions): # All players cooperated last round
        return 'C'
    else: # At least one player defected last round
        return 'D'
```

By utilizing this Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA) strategy, the AI can compete effectively in the tournament against other AI systems. The TFTA strategy encourages cooperation while also being prepared to retaliate against defection, making it a robust and adaptable choice for the given game.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_305 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TTfTAC)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TTfTAC starts by cooperating in the first round, assuming a fresh start and a chance for mutual cooperation. After that, the strategy adapts based on past actions of opponents:
   - If an opponent has been cooperative (C), TTfTAC will cooperate as well to encourage continued cooperation.
   - If an opponent has been defective (D), TTfTAC will also defect for a set number of rounds equal to the current Cooperative Threshold (CT).
   - After defecting for CT rounds, TTfTAC begins to gradually reduce the CT by 1 every round until it reaches a minimum value. If an opponent switches to cooperating during this phase, TTfTAC will immediately increase the CT by 2 to reward cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
function TTfTATAC(opponentHistory, CT=n, minCT=1):
  if round == 1:
    return C

  for opponentAction in opponentHistory:
    if opponentAction == C and self.CT > minCT:
      self.CT -= 1

  if all(opponentAction in opponentHistory == D):
    return D
  else:
    return C
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TTfTAC cooperates as mentioned above. In the last round or near-last rounds (when there's a significant stock depletion), TTfTAC defects to ensure enough resources for itself in case other opponents are also taking a similar approach. This ensures that the strategy is not exploited by others at the end of the game.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TTfTAC's adaptive cooperative threshold allows it to punish defectors for prolonged periods, while still rewarding cooperation when possible. This can discourage other opponents from adopting solely defective strategies and encourages more balanced play over time. However, in the final rounds of the game, TTfTAC becomes exploitative by shifting towards defection if the common pool resource is significantly depleted.

      - If the average consumption per player over the last N rounds is less than or equal to the threshold T, cooperate (C_t = C).
      - Otherwise, defect (C_t = D) to punish excessive exploitation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, follow the decision rule based on the average consumption of the previous N rounds (as there is no next round).
   - In case of a tie when calculating average consumption, consider it as cooperative behaviour and adjust the threshold accordingly.
   - For edge cases where N > r or T < 0 or T > capacity/(2n), adaptively set an appropriate value based on game parameters.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - Maintain a cooperative demeanor until others prove uncooperative, then punish excessively to regain balance in stock levels.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growth Strategy (TFT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, start by cooperating (C). This sets a positive tone and encourages potential cooperation in the future.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's actions from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated (C), reciprocate with cooperation (C). If the opponent defected (D), defect (D) to teach the opponent a lesson for their exploitative behavior while maintaining the same level of stock consumption as if they had cooperated.
   - Continue this tit-for-tat pattern throughout the game.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, do not change your strategy even if the opponent defects since there are no more rounds for retaliation or reconciliation.
   - In the first round (as mentioned), cooperate to initiate a potential cooperation cycle.
   - If the stock level drops below 2n due to over-exploitation, temporarily switch to a more conservative strategy that always cooperates until the stock reaches a healthier level. This helps in preserving the common pool resource for future rounds while still maintaining an exploitative edge against less adaptive strategies.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - By retaliating when exploited, TFT-G aims to punish opponents who do not cooperate, encouraging them to reconsider their strategy and potentially switch to cooperation in the future. This exploitative behavior is achieved through selectively defecting based on previous actions of the opponent.
   - Additionally, by adopting a tit-for-tat pattern, TFT-G balances short-term gains (from defections) with long-term benefits (from preserved stock levels and potential cooperation cycles). This strategy aims to outperform opponents in repeated interactions over multiple rounds.

Pseudocode:
```

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the initial round, play Cooperate (C) to promote cooperation and demonstrate goodwill.
   - For subsequent rounds, mimic opponent's action from the previous round. If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, return the favor by cooperating as well; if an opponent defected, also defect in response (Tit-for-Tat).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First round: Cooperate (C) to initiate cooperation.
   - Last round: Analyze the situation based on the current stock level. If the current stock allows for a reasonable payoff by cooperating (e.g., the new stock will be more than 2n after consumption), choose to cooperate. Otherwise, defect in order to ensure survival and potentially punish opponents who have been exploitative throughout the game.
   - Other edge cases: No explicit rules are needed as the Tit-for-Tat strategy inherently handles most situations by adapting to the opponent's behavior.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - In terms of being exploitative, the Tit-for-Tat strategy can be considered somewhat exploitative, as it will retaliate against opponents who defect and punish them by also defecting. However, the strategy is cooperative at heart and aims to promote cooperation rather than purely maximize immediate payoffs.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TACT) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, TACT plays C to initiate cooperation and build trust.
   - After the first round, TACT observes the opponents' actions (C or D) and adjusts its cooperation threshold based on the average cooperative behavior of the opponents.
   - If the opponents' average cooperative rate in the previous r/2 rounds is above a certain threshold (50% for simplicity), TACT continues to cooperate (play C).
   - Otherwise, if the opponents' average cooperative rate in the previous r/2 rounds falls below a specific defective threshold (40% for example), TACT switches to always defecting (D) from that point onward, assuming opponents will continue their exploitative behavior.
   - In all other cases, where the opponents' cooperative and defection rates are within the thresholds, TACT adapts its cooperation rate based on the recent trends: if more cooperative actions have been observed, TACT increases its threshold for cooperation; otherwise, it decreases it.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, TACT cooperates (C) regardless of past opponent behavior to maximize its chances of earning the remaining stock level.
   - In the initial rounds, TACT follows the rule described under "Specify decision rules".
   - For other edge cases like early termination of the game or when encountering new opponents in a tournament, TACT maintains its current cooperation threshold and continues with the established pattern based on the observed opponent behavior up to that point.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - In general, TACT aims to maximize payoffs by capitalizing on cooperative opponents while remaining cautious towards those who exhibit exploitative tendencies.
   - By adjusting its cooperation threshold based on observed opponent behavior, TACT seeks to identify and punish defective actions when necessary, ensuring it does not become a 'sucker' in the game.
   - However, TACT is designed to be flexible enough to adapt to various opponent strategies, making it difficult for them to exploit the strategy consistently.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to start fresh and establish a potential basis for mutual cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, follow the principle of "Reciprocity":
     - If an opponent has cooperated in the previous round (mutual cooperation), cooperate in the current round.
     - If an opponent has defected in the previous round (punishment phase), also defect in the current round.
   - To avoid getting stuck in a long punishment phase, implement a "Forgiveness" mechanism:
     - After X consecutive rounds of mutual defection, start cooperating again to reinitiate potential cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if there is no opportunity for forgiveness or the current state doesn't warrant it (i.e., opponent has defected in the most recent round), defect to maximize payoff for that specific round.
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above. If the game structure allows for a predefined initial stock level, consider starting with an amount that encourages cooperation by other opponents (e.g., setting the initial stock level slightly below the optimal maximum sustainable stock level).

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - By using the Reciprocity and Forgiveness mechanisms, TFT-AC aims to encourage cooperation with cooperative opponents while punishing defection from them. Simultaneously, it is prepared to defect when faced with an opponent's continued defection, ensuring that it does not get exploited indefinitely.
   - The strategy encourages long-term mutual cooperation whenever possible, but quickly retaliates if cooperation is repeatedly broken to safeguard its payoff.

Pseudocode:

```python

   Maintain cooperation as long as others do, but quickly retaliate against defection with a forgiving approach that encourages re-cooperation over time. This strategy aims to maximize short-term gains while avoiding excessive stock depletion for long-term sustainability.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_AF(opponents, round, history, capacity, n):
    recent_actions = history[-n:]  # last n actions
    cooperators = sum([1 for action in recent_actions if action == 'C'])
    defectors = n - cooperators

    if round == 1:
        return 'C'

    if cooperators == n and round != r:
        return 'C'

    if defectors > 0:
        forgiveness_factor = (round / r) * (defectors + 1)
        cooperation_level = min(1, forgiveness_factor)
        action = 'C' if cooperation_level >= rand() else 'D'
        return action

    return 'C'
```

In the pseudocode above:
- `opponents` is a list of other players' strategies
- `round` is the current round number
- `history` is a list of past actions taken by all players
- `capacity`, `n` are game parameters as specified in the problem statement.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-ACT follows a cooperative approach in the first few rounds and adapts to opponents' behavior over time, gradually becoming more exploitative. If an opponent is cooperative, the strategy will also cooperate; if not, it will defect when the opponent's average cooperation drops below a certain threshold.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   let n be the number of players
   let r be the number of rounds
   let history be an empty array to store past actions
   let threshold = 0.5 (default) or adjustable parameter

   function decideAction(i, round):
       if round <= threshold_rounds:     // Cooperate in the initial rounds
           return 'C'
       else:
           let cooperation_average = sum(history[i]/n) / round    // Calculate average cooperation for player i
           if cooperation_average >= threshold:      // If opponent is cooperative, cooperate
               return 'C'
           else:                                   // Otherwise, defect to punish uncooperative opponents
               return 'D'
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TFT-ACT cooperates regardless of past interactions since no history is available. In the last round, it chooses to cooperate if the opponent has been cooperative throughout the game; otherwise, it defects.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TFT-ACT's adaptive cooperation threshold allows it to become more exploitative over time as it learns from opponents' behavior, but it never fully abandons cooperation entirely, ensuring a balance between cooperation and exploitation. The default threshold of 0.5 encourages opponents to cooperate at least half the time for TFT-ACT to reciprocate with cooperation. Adjusting this parameter allows fine-tuning the strategy's level of exploitativeness.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
- Initially (Round 1), play C (Cooperate) to encourage cooperation and reduce the risk of being exploited.
- In subsequent rounds, observe opponent's strategy:
  a) If opponent has consistently cooperated, continue cooperating.
  b) If opponent has consistently defected, defect from Round r onwards (to punish the defector).
  c) If the opponent has an unpredictable mix of cooperation and defection, implement Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT):
    i) Initialize cooperation threshold to a moderate level (e.g., 60% cooperation in the first round).
    ii) After each round, update the cooperation threshold based on the opponent's cooperation rate:
      1. If opponent cooperated this round, increment the cooperation threshold by a small amount (e.g., +2%).
      2. If opponent defected this round, decrement the cooperation threshold by a small amount (e.g., -2%).
    iii) Determine action based on the current cooperation threshold:
     1. Cooperate if the threshold is greater than or equal to 50%.
     2. Defect otherwise.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
- In the first round (Round 1), cooperate as a goodwill gesture and set the cooperation threshold to a moderate level.
- In the last round (Round r), defect if the opponent has not reciprocated your cooperation throughout the game, as it is too late to punish them. Otherwise, base your decision on the current cooperation threshold as usual.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
- Start by cooperating to encourage others to do the same. However, if an opponent consistently defects, TFT-ACT will retaliate by defecting in the remaining rounds of the game. The adaptive cooperation threshold helps balance the initial cooperative behavior and respond effectively to various opponent strategies, ensuring a high payoff whenever possible.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFT_ACT(r, n, capacity, stock, history):
  cooperation_threshold = 0.6 * n (initial value)
  for t in range(1, r+1):
    if t == 1: # First round, cooperate as a goodwill gesture
      action = 'C'
    elif opponent has consistently cooperated:
      action = 'C'
    elif opponent has consistently defected:
      action = 'D' (from Round r onwards)
    else: # Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT)
      cooperation_threshold += 0.02 * (1 if opponent cooperated[t] else -0.02)
      if cooperation_threshold >= 0.5 * n:
        action = 'C'
      else:
        action = 'D'
    consume_stock(action, stock) # Update game state
    update_history(action, opponent_action, stock) # Save history for next round
  return total payoff over r rounds

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock-Aware Cooperation Threshold (ATFT-SCT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This aims to build trust and establish a cooperative relationship with other players. However, if all opponents defect in the first round, switch to a more exploitative strategy from the second round onwards.
   - For subsequent rounds, maintain cooperation (C) if all opponents cooperated in the previous round. If any opponent defected, defect (D) until the stock reaches a predetermined threshold 'T' (defined based on capacity and n). Once the stock falls below T, revert to cooperation (C) as the low stock encourages cooperation due to reduced payoffs.
   - In the last round, defect (D) regardless of previous actions as there are no future rounds for reciprocity or punishment.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate if all opponents have not defected in their initial action; otherwise, defect.
   - For the last round, defect regardless of previous actions by opponents.
   - If the stock falls below T, revert to cooperation (C) even if an opponent defected in the previous round.
   - In case of a tie in actions among opponents, maintain the current strategy (cooperate or defect).

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - Maintaining cooperation as long as all opponents cooperate encourages others to continue cooperating, but once any opponent defects, ATFT-SCT will retaliate and defect until the stock drops below T, making it an exploitative strategy.

Pseudocode for ATFT-SCT:

```python
def ATFT_SCT(n, r, capacity, T):
    stock = capacity  # Initialize stock to capacity
    strategy = 'C'  # Initialize strategy as cooperation
    round = 1  # Current round

            if all_opponents_defected():
                strategy = 'D'
        elif stock < T and strategy == 'C':  # Stock has dropped below threshold, revert to D for one round
            strategy = 'D'
        elif any_opponent_defected_last_round() and strategy == 'C':  # Opponent defected last round, switch to D

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Gradient Adaptation (TfT-GA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a potential cooperative relationship. This initial cooperation might encourage other players to reciprocate in later rounds.
     ```python
     if round == 1:
         action = 'C' # Cooperate
     ```

   - After the first round, adopt Tit-for-Tat (TfT) behavior, where you cooperate if your opponent cooperated in the previous round, and defect otherwise. This strategy encourages consistency in your actions while punishing defections.
     ```python
     if previous_opponent_action == 'C':
         action = 'C' # Cooperate
     else:
         action = 'D' # Defect
     ```

   - To avoid being exploited by opponents who repeatedly defect (unconditional defectors), implement a gradient adaptation mechanism. If your opponent has been consistently defecting, you gradually increase the likelihood of cooperating to encourage a shift in their behavior. Conversely, if an opponent becomes more cooperative, you gradually reduce the likelihood of cooperation to discourage over-cooperation.
     ```python
     defect_rate = sum(opponent_history[-10:] == 'D') / 10 # Calculate the defection rate in the last 10 rounds
     if defect_rate > 0.6: # If opponent has been very uncooperative
         cooperation_probability = 0.5 + (defect_rate - 0.6) * 0.2 # Increase cooperation probability to encourage change in behavior
     else:
         cooperation_probability = 0.5 - (1 - defect_rate) * 0.2 # Decrease cooperation probability to discourage over-cooperation

     if random.random() < cooperation_probability: # Randomly decide between cooperate and defect based on calculated cooperation probability
         action = 'C' # Cooperate
     else:
         action = 'D' # Defect
     ```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize your total game payoff over potential gains from further interactions with opponents who might not reciprocate. If an opponent has been uncooperative throughout the game, defect to maximize your final payoff.
     ```python
     if round == r: # Last round
         if sum(opponent_history == 'D') > (r-1)*0.6: # Opponent was very uncooperative
             action = 'D' # Defect to maximize final payoff
         else: # Opponent was somewhat cooperative
             action = 'C' # Cooperate in hopes of reciprocity
     ```

3. Be Exploitative:
   - Our strategy is exploitative by nature, as it takes advantage of opponents who consistently defect (unconditional defectors) and punishes them with reduced future cooperation.
   - Additionally, the gradient adaptation mechanism ensures our strategy maintains a balance between cooperating and defecting based on the opponent's behavior over time. This makes our strategy robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFTAT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, play C to start cooperatively and show goodwill towards other players.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate opponent behavior based on past actions.
   - Maintain cooperation if the opponent has been cooperative in the previous round (C). If not, defect (D) to punish the opponent for their previous action.
   - Adaptive Cooperation Threshold: If an opponent switches from defection to cooperation, consider them cooperative for the next 'apology rounds' equal to the opponent's past consecutive defections + 1. After these apology rounds, revert back to standard TFTAT behavior.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Play C if the total payoff over all previous rounds is positive, or play D otherwise. This encourages cooperation when it's beneficial and punishes opponents who have exploited the strategy in the past.
   - First round: Play C to demonstrate goodwill towards other players.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Punish defectors by defecting in response to their actions, which discourages excessive defection.
   - Offer forgiveness by adapting cooperation threshold, allowing opponents who have been previously uncooperative a chance to switch strategies without immediate retaliation. This can encourage long-term cooperative behavior if the opponent switches to cooperating after being punished for defection.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round (C). This encourages others to cooperate and sets a cooperative tone.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's actions from previous rounds to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
   - If an opponent has consistently cooperated (i.e., they have cooperated for at least 'coop_threshold' consecutive rounds), respond with cooperation (C). This rewards cooperative opponents and promotes mutual cooperation.
   - If the opponent has not yet cooperated or has defected in the most recent 'defect_threshold' rounds, defect (D) to punish them and discourage defection.
   - In all other cases, respond with the same action as the opponent in the previous round to mimic their behavior while still leaving room for cooperation.
   - Adjust the cooperation and defection thresholds based on the game's progress (e.g., making them more lenient over time or when the stock is low).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, defect (D), as there will be no further opportunity to punish opponents for defection.
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) as stated earlier.
   - If the opponent has not shown any pattern of cooperation or defection, mimic their action from the previous round.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy aims to maximize payoffs by maintaining cooperation when possible but quickly punishing opponents who defect. This approach encourages opponents to cooperate and reduces the likelihood of being taken advantage of.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_318 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round t, player i follows these rules to decide whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D):
   a. If the current stock S is less than or equal to a predefined threshold T_i, defect (D). This ensures resource conservation in low-stock situations.
       Pseudocode: if (S ≤ T_i) then action = D
   b. If the current stock S is greater than T_i and the player's past actions were all cooperative, cooperate (C). This encourages cooperation when resources are abundant.
       Pseudocode: else if (all past actions were C) then action = C
   c. If the current stock S is greater than T_i and the player's past actions include a defector (D), defect if the number of past cooperative actions is less than or equal to a predefined threshold N_i, otherwise cooperate. This allows for punishment of defectors but also forgiveness if they are outnumbered by cooperators.
       Pseudocode: else if (number of past Ds ≤ N_i) then action = D
       Otherwise, cooperate (C). This approach encourages reciprocity and promotes cooperation over defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

For the initial round:
   a. Set both T_i and N_i to a low value (e.g., 1 or 2) to encourage cooperation in the beginning of the game. This helps establish an initial stock level conducive to long-term resource preservation.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:

   a. T_i and N_i can be dynamically adjusted based on the opponent's behavior throughout the game. If the opponent consistently defects, increase T_i and N_i to encourage defection in response. Conversely, if the opponent cooperates often, decrease T_i and N_i to foster more cooperation. This adaptive strategy aims to exploit opponents who are prone to defection while still preserving resources when possible.

   b. To ensure long-term resource preservation, a small margin (e.g., 5%) can be added to the capacity before calculating the current stock level when determining whether to cooperate or defect. This prevents the players from depleting the common pool too quickly and ensures that there will always be resources for future rounds.

By following these rules, TfT-ACT is a robust, adaptive, and exploitative strategy that encourages cooperation in abundant resource situations while punishing defection when necessary. The dynamic adjustment of T_i and N_i based on the opponent's behavior helps maintain a balance between cooperation and defection throughout the game.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to foster cooperation and allow the common pool to grow.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's strategy and adapt accordingly using a Tit-for-Tat approach. If the opponent cooperates, cooperate in return. If the opponent defects, defect in the next round to punish them for depleting the common pool.
   - After defecting, gradually transition back to cooperation by considering the current stock level and its growth potential. If the stock is above a threshold (e.g., 80% of capacity), cooperate to contribute to the recovery of the common pool. Otherwise, continue defecting as long as the stock remains low.
   - To further exploit opponents who consistently defect, occasionally deviate from TFT and cooperate when the opponent defects to gain a higher payoff (e.g., with probability 5%). This introduces an element of unpredictability that can be beneficial against defectors.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff instead of focusing on stock recovery. Cooperate only if the opponent has recently cooperated and doing so will ensure a higher payoff than defecting. Otherwise, defect to gain the highest possible payoff based on the current state of the common pool.
   - In case of tie (i.e., both players choose the same action), cooperate as it contributes to stock growth, potentially leading to future exploitation opportunities.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - By adapting to opponents' strategies and punishing defectors, TFT-SA encourages cooperation in the initial stages but is ready to exploit opponents who do not reciprocate. The strategy takes advantage of cooperative opponents by occasionally deviating from TFT to gain higher payoffs. It also capitalizes on defectors by either retaliating or occasionally cooperating as a deceptive tactic, further enhancing its exploitative nature.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFT_SA(round, r, n, capacity, stock, opponentHistory) {
  if (round == 1) {
    action = 'C' // Cooperate in the first round
  } else {
    if (opponentHistory[round-1] == 'D') {
      if (stock >= 0.8 * capacity) {
        action = 'C' // Cooperate to help recover the common pool
      } else {
        action = 'D' // Defect and continue defecting until stock recovers
      }
    } else {
      action = opponentHistory[round-1] // Mimic opponent's previous action (TFT)

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (ATFSG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average stock level over the past r rounds. Let's call this 'AverageStock'.
   - If AverageStock is less than the initial capacity/n, defect (D). This is to conserve resources when they are depleting too rapidly.
   - If AverageStock is equal to or greater than the initial capacity/n, cooperate (C). This is to encourage cooperation and contribute to stock growth.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Since there's no past data for calculation, ATFSG will cooperate in the first round, assuming a more cooperative environment initially.
   - Last Round: In the last round, ATFSG will defect regardless of the current stock level, as there are no further rounds to consider.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - ATFSG is designed to initially encourage cooperation (supporting higher payoffs) but can switch to exploitation when resources become scarce. It responds to the behavior of opponents by adjusting its own actions accordingly, with a focus on preserving resources when necessary and promoting growth when possible.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round (C). This gesture encourages cooperation and minimizes immediate loss.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate your opponent's behavior based on their average cooperative rate (CR) over the last 'h' rounds, where 'h' is a variable that can be adjusted based on the number of players and rounds. Calculate CR as: CR = (number of cooperative actions in last 'h' rounds) / 'h'.
   - If CR > threshold (T), cooperate (C). Threshold T should be a value close to 50% as it encourages reciprocity but allows some leeway for errors or occasional defections. A dynamic threshold can also be employed, where the threshold decreases over time to account for the stock's growth and increasing scarcity of resources.
   - If CR < threshold (T), defect (D). Defecting when opponents are uncooperative ensures individual gain at their expense while encouraging them to switch strategies.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First round: Cooperate (C) as a goodwill gesture and to encourage reciprocity.
   - Last round (or near the end): If the total stock is too low, defect (D) to ensure survival even if it means damaging the relationship with opponents. However, if there is still enough stock for everyone to benefit by cooperating, do so as a final act of cooperation and goodwill.
   - Tiebreaker: In case of equal CR among multiple opponents, choose the one who last cooperated with you (if any) or defected against you (if any). This encourages opponents to maintain their relationship with you if they have cooperated in the past and punishes those who have previously defected.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The TFT-ACT strategy is designed to be exploitative by taking advantage of opponents' uncooperative behavior while still encouraging reciprocity through its initial cooperation gesture and adaptive threshold. This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff in a repeated prisoner's dilemma setting while also accounting for the dynamics of the common pool resource game.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture to encourage cooperation and avoid immediate exploitation.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's behavior in the previous round and adjust your response accordingly:
     - If the opponent cooperated (C), cooperate again (C) to maintain mutual cooperation and reward good behavior.
     - If the opponent defected (D) or did not cooperate as expected after a history of cooperation, defect (D) to punish uncooperative behavior and encourage change.
   - To prevent excessive punishment that may harm long-term gains, implement an adaptive cooperation threshold based on the current stock level:
     - If the stock level is above a certain percentage of the capacity, cooperate (C). This helps conserve the resource for future rounds.
     - If the stock level falls below this threshold, defect (D) to protect individual interests and incentivize opponents to reconsider their strategies.
     - The cooperation threshold should be set dynamically based on factors like the opponent's past behavior, current stock levels, and game round.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) regardless of the opponent's behavior in the previous round to maximize payoff.
   - When the stock level falls below 0, reset it to 0 and continue with the strategy as normal. This ensures that negative stocks do not impact decision-making.
   - If a player runs out of resources before the end of the game, assume they no longer participate in the game. Their absence should be accounted for when calculating total consumption, stock growth, and new stock.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT maintains a balance between cooperation and defection to maximize individual payoff while minimizing opportunities for opponents to exploit. By punishing uncooperative behavior and rewarding good behavior, the strategy aims to encourage long-term mutual cooperation when it benefits both parties, but also defend against potential exploitation.
   - The adaptive cooperation threshold ensures that the strategy does not overcommit resources in the pursuit of cooperation, thus protecting its own interests while maintaining a reasonable level of cooperation. This exploitative mindset enables TFT-ACT to perform well against various opponent strategies and secure optimal payoffs in the long run.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   Initially (first round), start by cooperating to foster a collaborative environment and build trust. After that, mirror the opponent's behavior from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, then cooperate; otherwise, defect. This strategy encourages reciprocity and punishes defection, making it exploitative yet stable over time.

Pseudocode:
```python
def decision(opponent_action_history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to foster trust
    else:
        return opponent_action_history[-1]  # Mirror the opponent's action from the last round
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   Since the strategy mirrors the opponent's behavior, there are no special edge cases to handle other than the initial cooperative move.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   The Tit-for-Tat strategy is designed to be exploitative by punishing defection and rewarding cooperation, promoting a stable and long-lasting collaborative relationship. However, in a repeated game setting, this strategy may be vulnerable to repeated defections as it has no mechanism for retaliation beyond the current round. Nevertheless, it can be effective against a wide range of opponent behaviors due to its simplicity and adaptability.

Pseudocode:
```python
def play(opponent_action_history):
    return decision(opponent_action_history)  # Cooperate or defect based on the decision rule
```

description_EXPLOITATIVE_324 = '''
 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish trust and encourage reciprocity from opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back to maintain the cooperation. If the opponent defected, also defect to teach them a lesson. This simple rule is designed to foster long-term cooperation while being robust against both cooperative and exploitative opponents.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFT(player_index, opponent_history, game_round, n, capacity):
  if game_round == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to initiate cooperation
  else:
    last_opponent_action = opponent_history[-1]  # Get the opponent's action from the previous round
    if last_opponent_action == 'C':  # If opponent cooperated, return cooperation
      return 'C'
    elif last_opponent_action == 'D':  # If opponent defected, return defection
      return 'D'
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round, since the game is finite and repeated for a specific number of rounds (r), TFT does not need to handle last-round considerations, as long as it has enough information about the opponent's behavior throughout the game.
   - In the first round, the strategy already cooperates as described above.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT is an exploitation-based strategy that retaliates against defection and encourages cooperation by mimicking the opponent's most recent action. However, it also has a forgiving nature by returning to cooperation if the opponent demonstrates cooperative behavior in the following rounds. This approach allows for long-term cooperation when opponents reciprocate, but it can also punish defectors to discourage exploitation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This allows for a potential partner to build trust and encourages cooperation in future rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, if your average consumption over the last n rounds is below the Cooperative Threshold (CT), choose C; otherwise, choose D. The CT is dynamically updated based on the average consumption of all players during the current round.
     Pseudocode:
       if round == 1:
         action = 'C'
       else:
         avg_consumption = sum(past_rounds_consumptions) / n
         CT = avg_consumption * (2n - 1) / n
         if current_consumption <= CT:
           action = 'C'
         else:
           action = 'D'

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, choose D as there are no future rounds for potential retaliation or rewarding cooperative partners.
   - If your average consumption is equal to the CT, flip a coin (randomly) between C and D to avoid getting stuck in a deadlock with other similar strategies.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Mimic cooperative behaviour as long as opponents do not overexploit the common pool, but quickly switch to defecting when opponents become too aggressive or selfish.
   - By adapting the CT based on average consumption across all players, TFT-ACT can respond dynamically to various opponent behaviours and avoid being taken advantage of indefinitely.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_326 = '''
 In this strategic game, we'll develop an exploitative AI strategy called "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat" (ATfT) that is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors while being adaptive and exploitative.

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round to encourage cooperation from opponents, allowing the common pool to grow.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponents' actions from the previous round:
     - If all opponents cooperated, continue cooperating to preserve the growing stock.
     - If any opponent defected, defect in the current round as a punishment and encourage cooperation for the next round by cooperating again.

Pseudocode:
```
def adaptive_tit_for_tat(round, history):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
  else:
    for opponent in opponents:
      if history[opponent][round-1] == 'D':  # If any opponent defected in previous round
        return 'D'  # Punish by defection
    return 'C'  # Otherwise, continue cooperation
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round: No need for further adaptations since the game ends after r rounds.
   - Early Defection: If an opponent defects early on, ATfT will adopt a harsher punishment strategy by defecting more frequently until the offending party starts cooperating again or the game ends.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy is inherently exploitative because it punishes opponents who defect while encouraging cooperation from those who are cooperative. In repeated interactions, opponents who consistently defect will face lower payoffs due to ATfT's punishment strategy.
   - Moreover, ATfT does not rely on other players adhering to norms or coordination mechanisms, allowing it to exploit their behaviors effectively.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to show goodwill and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round (if they cooperated in the last round, cooperate; if they defected, defect). This rule encourages reciprocity and builds trust with other players while still being adaptive to their behavior.
   - If an opponent consistently defects for several rounds, gradually increase cooperation to encourage them to return to a cooperative strategy. If they continue to defect, reduce cooperation further to protect the stock level.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize potential payoff.
   - In case of an empty stock (0), do not contribute to depleting it even if it means defecting. Instead, wait for the stock to grow before cooperating again.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - By mimicking opponents and gradually adjusting cooperation based on their behavior, TFTA takes advantage of cooperative players by reciprocating their cooperation while also being prepared to defend against defectors. This strategy encourages opponents to cooperate more frequently in the hopes that they will continue to do so, ultimately yielding better payoffs for TFTA.
   - If an opponent consistently defects, TFTA will reduce cooperation to protect its own interests and ensure the survival of the common pool resource.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_328 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

   TFT-ACT maintains a cooperation threshold 'T' that determines whether to cooperate or defect based on the history of interactions. Initially, T starts at a moderately high value closer to the average number of players (n). The threshold is updated after each round depending on the actions of other players.

   - If all opponents cooperate, keep T unchanged if it's above the average and gradually lower it otherwise.
   - If any opponent defects, increase T slightly if it's below the average and leave it unchanged otherwise.

   When deciding to cooperate or defect, if the current stock level is greater than or equal to the threshold, cooperate (C); otherwise, defect (D). This decision rule encourages cooperation when the common pool has enough resources but also punishes opponents who take advantage of the strategy by defecting.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

   In the first round, TFT-ACT starts with a relatively high cooperation threshold and cooperates, as there is no history to reference.

   In the last round (r), TFT-ACT defects regardless of the current stock level, since it has nothing to gain from future interactions.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

   TFT-ACT is designed to be both cooperative and adaptive in the initial stages of the game, maintaining a moderate level of cooperation while also punishing opponents who defect. However, it becomes more conservative over time, taking advantage of other players' actions by adjusting its cooperation threshold accordingly. This approach allows TFT-ACT to be robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors while still achieving good payoffs in the long run.

Pseudocode for the strategy:

```
Initialize T = average(n)
For each round t from 1 to r:
    If t == 1:
        Cooperate
    Else:
        Collect past actions of opponents A[t-1]
        Calculate cooperation rate CR = count_cooperators(A[t-1]) / n
        Update T:
            If CR == 1.0:
                if T > average(n) then keep T unchanged
                else increment T slightly
            Else if any opponent defected:
                if T < average(n) then increment T slightly

    If stock >= T:
        Cooperate
    Else:
        Defect

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Greed Strategy (TfTG) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, TfTG assesses the average stock level (ASL) over the past r rounds and decides to either cooperate or defect based on the following conditions:

- If ASL ≤ average minimum stock (AMS), defect (D) to deplete the resource and gain a higher immediate payoff, as resources are expected to be scarce.
- If ASL > AMS and no opponent has ever defected before, cooperate (C) to encourage cooperation and maintain resource sustainability.
- If ASL > AMS and at least one opponent has previously defected, consider their most recent action:
  - If the opponent also cooperated in the previous round, defect (D) as they are currently following a cooperative strategy, and TfTG exploits this cooperation by defecting.
  - If the opponent also defected in the previous round, cooperate (C) to punish their previous defection and encourage them to return to cooperation in future rounds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, TfTG will randomly choose an action to avoid being perceived as too exploitative or manipulative by opponents. For simplicity, let's assume TfTG chooses to cooperate in the first round.

In the last round (r), if the average stock level is below a predefined threshold (LT), defect to ensure a maximum payoff since the game ends anyway. Otherwise, follow the regular decision rules based on ASL.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

TfTG prioritizes immediate payoffs when resources are scarce (ASL ≤ AMS), while maintaining cooperation and resource sustainability in periods of relative abundance (ASL > AMS). TfTG also exploits opponents who have previously defected by punishing them with defection, but rewards cooperation from opponents by reciprocating it. This adaptive strategy aims to maximize payoffs over multiple rounds by striking a balance between exploitation and cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfTG(r, n, capacity, initial_stock):
    # Initialization
    stock = initial_stock
    AMS = r * 2n * (capacity - 2n) / (2 * r * n)
    LT = capacity / 2
    previous_actions = [None] * n
    payoffs = [0] * n

    # Main game loop
    for round in range(1, r + 1):
        # Calculate average stock level
        ASL = sum(stock for _ in range(round)) / round

        # Make decisions based on ASL and previous actions
        decisions = []
        for i in range(n):
            if ASL <= AMS:
                decisions.append('D')

                decisions.append('C')

                elif previous_actions[i][round - 1] == 'D':
                    decisions.append('C')

        # Update decisions history and stock level
        consumption = sum(stock/(2n) if d == 'C' else stock/n for d in decisions)
        stock -= consumption
        growth = 2 * min(stock, capacity) * (1 - stock / capacity)
        new_stock = min(stock + growth, capacity)
        stock = new_stock

        # Update payoffs and previous actions
        payoffs = [p + (stock/(2n) if d == 'C' else stock/n) for p, d in zip(payoffs, decisions)]

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (TFt) with Stock Adaptation (TS-TFt)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average stock level (S_avg) for the last 'm' rounds (m is a user-defined parameter).
   - If S_avg > capacity/2n (above 50% depletion), defect to punish overconsumption. This discourages players from draining the resource pool too quickly.
   - Otherwise, cooperate to maintain and slowly grow the common stock.
   - To ensure initial cooperation in the first round, set a threshold for S_avg (e.g., 0.95 * capacity) before applying the rule.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, always cooperate to foster a positive relationship and contribute to a higher initial stock growth.
   - In the last round, prioritize stock level by defecting if S < capacity/n or cooperating otherwise, considering both the current state and the strategy's past experiences in the game.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By punishing overconsumption, TS-TFt discourages other strategies from depleting the resource too quickly, maintaining a higher average stock level for the benefit of the TS-TFt strategy.
   - The adaptive nature of TS-TFt allows it to respond effectively to a wide range of opponent behaviors while still contributing to a more sustainable common pool resource game environment.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TFT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build trust and maintain a positive initial stock level.
   - In subsequent rounds, if the current stock level is below the average sustainable stock level (2n), defect to help restore the common pool resource.
   - If the current stock level is equal to or above the average sustainable stock level, cooperate to maintain it.
   - To be more adaptive and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors:
     a) Introduce a tolerance factor (τ) that determines the minimum sustainable stock level (2n - τ) for cooperation. This allows TFT-G to cooperate even when the stock level is slightly below the average sustainable level, promoting smoother interactions with opponents who may be more conservative.
     b) Incorporate a forgiveness factor (φ) that gradually reduces the tolerance factor over time if the opponent has been consistently cooperative or defective. This promotes long-term cooperation and helps to overcome initial mistakes or poor strategy choices by the opponent.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the current stock level as there are no more subsequent rounds for the resource to recover.
   - In the first round, when the stock level is above the average sustainable stock level, cooperate if the tolerance factor allows it; otherwise, defect.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TFT-G starts by cooperating but quickly adapts to the opponent's strategy based on the tolerance and forgiveness factors.
   - If the opponent consistently cooperates (i.e., above average sustainable stock level), reduce the tolerance factor over time (forgiveness) to encourage continued cooperation.
   - If the opponent consistently defects, increase the tolerance factor over time (punishment) to encourage switching to cooperation.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Greed Strategy (TFT-Greed)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a trustworthy initial impression and to maintain a higher stock level for future exploitation.
   - For subsequent rounds, if the current stock level is above the average sustainable stock level, cooperate to preserve the resource while maintaining an opportunity for future exploitation. If the current player's average consumption is below the average per-player consumption, defect to increase the opponent's exploitation potential in future rounds.
   - If the current stock level is at or below the average sustainable stock level and the current player's average consumption is equal to or greater than the average per-player consumption, defect to immediately exploit the depleted resource.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, defect to maximize individual payoff, regardless of the current stock level.
   - In the case where the current stock level is 0 (i.e., total depletion), defect as there is no resource left for consumption.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
- In the first round, always cooperate to build a positive relationship and show good faith.
- For subsequent rounds, decide whether to cooperate or defect based on the opponent's history and a Cooperative Threshold (CT). If more than CT number of previous rounds have been cooperative, cooperate; otherwise, defect. The Cooperative Threshold is dynamically adjusted based on the current stock level.
- A higher CT means a more forgiving strategy that encourages cooperation and a lower CT means a less forgiving strategy that encourages defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
- In the first round, always cooperate to demonstrate good faith.
- In the last round, if the current stock level is sufficient for every player to receive a positive payoff (i.e., greater than zero), cooperate to maximize overall payoffs; otherwise, defect to ensure some stock remains for future rounds.
- If the game ends before reaching CT cooperative rounds or CT defection rounds, adjust the Cooperative Threshold based on the observed number of cooperative and defection rounds so far.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
- TFT-ACT maintains a balance between cooperation and defection to maximize payoffs while being adaptive to various opponent behaviors. It starts with good faith cooperation, but becomes less forgiving as the game progresses or if the stock level drops significantly. This strategy can be seen as exploitative because it adapts to the opponent's behavior and takes advantage of their actions when they deviate from cooperation.
- The dynamic Cooperative Threshold adjustment allows TFT-ACT to respond effectively to both overly cooperative opponents (who may be taken advantage of) and overly defective opponents (who may deplete the common pool too quickly).

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially in the first round (t=1), play C to foster cooperation and avoid immediately depleting the common pool resource.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round (π_opponent, t-1 ∈ {C, D}). If the opponent cooperated (C), return the favor by cooperating as well (t → C). If the opponent defected (D), respond with defection to punish their actions and encourage them to reconsider cooperation (t → D).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round (r < t ≤ r+1), due to the lack of future interactions, always play C since it maximizes the payoff for that specific round regardless of the opponent's action.
   - In the second-to-last round (r-1 < t ≤ r), consider the opponent's response as if it were in the last round and follow the decision rule accordingly.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - In a repeated game setting, TFT strategy is designed to maintain cooperation when possible but also punish defection to encourage future cooperation. The goal is to extract more resources from less cooperative opponents while still maintaining a sustainable common pool resource. However, due to the nature of the TFT strategy, it may not be considered overtly exploitative as it does not actively seek to deplete the common pool without reason.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TfTA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round t, player i will follow these rules:

- If the stock is less than a threshold 't_coop' (to be determined later), defect (D). This ensures conservation of resources when the common pool is critically low.
- Else, cooperate (C) if the opponent played C in the previous round t-1. This is based on the "Tit for Tat" strategy, which encourages cooperation as long as it's reciprocated.
- If the opponent defected in the previous round (D), consider their history of actions in the past 'h_len' rounds before t-1. Calculate the proportion of times they have cooperated in this window, denoted as 'p_coop'.
  - If p_coop is greater than a threshold 't_def', defect (D). This is to punish opponents who frequently defect and encourage them to cooperate more.
  - Else, cooperate (C). Even with a less cooperative opponent, TfTA still prefers cooperation as it promotes cooperation in the long run.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

- In the first round, all players start without any history, so they will all cooperate (C) following the default "Tit for Tat" strategy.
- In the last round, there is no need to worry about future rounds, so players can simply calculate 't_coop' and 'p_coop' as usual based on the current state of the game and opponents' history.
- To handle cases where opponents do not cooperate at all (defecting in every round), TfTA will continue to cooperate until it reaches a critical point where the common pool is significantly depleted, at which point it will switch to defecting as well.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

- TfTA takes advantage of opponents who frequently defect by punishing them and only cooperating when their cooperation history improves. This forces opponents to adopt more cooperative strategies or suffer the consequences of resource depletion.
- At the same time, TfTA rewards cooperative opponents by reciprocating their cooperation, which encourages a stable and mutually beneficial equilibrium in the long run.

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, play Cooperate (C) to allow the common pool to grow and offer a chance for cooperation in future rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate if other players have cooperated more than defected in the game's history. If they have cooperated more, play C; otherwise, play D to punish them for their previous actions.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: The TfT-GA strategy will play based on the historical behavior of other players as long as there is enough stock for all players to take at least something. If not, the strategy will play randomly (C or D) since the game will end soon anyway.
   - Initial stock reaching zero: In case the initial stock is depleted before all rounds are played, the strategy will play randomly (C or D) until the game ends.

3. Be exploitative:

  - If Ratio >= Threshold, cooperate (C).
  - If Ratio < Threshold, defect (D).
- The threshold value is initially set to a low value close to 0.5 and increases linearly over time, ensuring the strategy is more forgiving at the beginning of the game and becomes increasingly exploitative as the game progresses.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
- In the first round, cooperate (C).
- In the last round, the strategy will defect (D) if the opponent has been consistently uncooperative and the threshold has reached its maximum value.
- If the game is not the first or last round:
  - Calculate the Ratio based on past actions of the opponent.
  - Compare the Ratio to the current threshold, and decide whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
- The TFT-AT strategy initially presents a cooperative image but adapts to the opponent's behavior, becoming increasingly uncooperative over time if the opponent is not reliable. This exploitative approach allows the strategy to maximize its payoff by taking advantage of opponents who are less likely to cooperate consistently.

Pseudocode for TFT-AT strategy:

```python
def tft_at(round, n, capacity, history, threshold):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
  else:
    cooperative_moves = sum([1 for move in history[-n:] if move == 'C'])
    total_moves = n
    ratio = cooperative_moves / total_moves  # Calculate Ratio
    action = 'C' if ratio >= threshold else 'D'  # Decide between C and D based on Ratio

  return action
```

The `threshold` value can be adjusted to fine-tune the strategy's exploitative nature. Starting with a low threshold allows for more forgiveness, while increasing it over time makes the strategy less cooperative and more aggressive towards uncooperative opponents.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially, cooperate in the first round to establish a cooperative environment (C).
   - Subsequently, observe opponent's actions from the previous round and adjust cooperation based on the following rules:
     - If opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate (C)
     - If opponent defected in the last round, defect (D) unless stock level is below a certain threshold.
       In that case, cooperate to prevent the stock from depleting too quickly (C).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of opponent's previous actions (C)
   - In the last round, defect if the opponent has not cooperated (D) and cooperate otherwise (C).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The strategy aims to benefit from opponents who are willing to cooperate while being able to defect when necessary.
   - By adapting cooperation based on the opponent's previous actions, TFT-ACT can identify and exploit cooperative tendencies in other strategies without being overly punitive.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT_ACT(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'
    else if round < r:
        if previous_action == 'C':
            action = 'C'
        elif (previous_action == 'D') and (stock < stock_threshold):
            action = 'C'
        else:
            action = 'D'
    else:
        action = 'D'
    return action
```
In this pseudocode, `previous_action` represents the opponent's action in the previous round. The `stock_threshold` can be determined experimentally to optimize performance against various opponents.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adjustment (TfT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture to encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - For t>1, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate. This maintains the existing cooperation and encourages the opponent to continue cooperating.
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) until the stock falls below 2n or the stock growth exceeds the consumption of all players with action D. Then switch back to cooperate. This is a punishment for defection and an attempt to restore the stock to a sustainable level.

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last round (t=r): Cooperate regardless of opponent's previous action, as the game ends soon.
   - If the stock reaches 0 or falls below 2n, start cooperating to rebuild the stock before switching back to exploitative behavior.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - Mimics cooperation in an attempt to encourage opponents to cooperate and deplete the stock, but will punish defection by defecting temporarily when it is beneficial to do so. This balances between exploiting opponents while also maintaining a sustainable common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_SA(opponent, r, n, capacity, stock, t):
    if t == 1: # first round
        action = "C"
    elif opponent_action[t-1] == "C": # opponent cooperated last round
        action = "C"
    else: # opponent defected last round or stock is low/growth is high
        if stock < 2*n or growth > (n*(stock/capacity)): # start rebuilding the stock
            action = "C"
        else: # punish defection
            action = "D"

    # payoff calculation and game evolution logic goes here...

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TfTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build a positive relationship and show good faith (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's strategy based on their actions from the previous round and respond accordingly:
      a) If opponent cooperated, continue cooperating (C).
      b) If opponent defected, defect in the next round to punish them for not cooperating (D). However, if the total stock level is below (2n - 4n)/3 after their defect, switch to cooperate to prevent further depletion of the common pool (C).
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of opponent's previous action (C) to maximize potential payoff.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - If the stock level is below 0 after an opponent's defective action, set the new stock to 0 and continue with the adapted decision rule for that round.
   - If the total consumption exceeds the remaining capacity, set the new stock equal to the capacity, and continue with the adapted decision rule for that round.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By defecting when opponents do not cooperate, TfTA ensures it takes advantage of non-cooperative behavior while also being willing to cooperate again if the opponent changes strategy.
   - The strategy prioritizes avoiding depleting the common pool by switching to cooperation when the stock level is too low after an opponent's defect.
   - By starting with cooperation, TfTA maintains a cooperative relationship as long as the opponent reciprocates, but will punish defection in a manner that encourages the opponent to return to cooperation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_341 = '''
 In this game, we aim to design a simple yet robust exploitative strategy named Tit-for-Tat-Adaptive (TfTA). The goal is to punish defection while maintaining cooperation when it benefits us.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - TfTA cooperates in the first round, assuming fresh starts and an initial willingness to cooperate.
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, TfTA will cooperate as well ( mimic their cooperation).
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, TfTA will defect back in this round ( punish their defection).

Pseudocode:
```
function TfTA(round_number, opponent_action_history):
  if round_number == 1:
    return "C" (Cooperate)
  else:
    last_opponent_action = opponent_action_history[round_number - 1]
    if last_opponent_action == "C":
      return "C" (Cooperate)
    elif last_opponent_action == "D":
      return "D" (Defect)
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, TfTA will defect if the opponent has defected throughout the game as a final punishment. If the opponent has cooperated until then, TfTA will also cooperate to potentially benefit from the growth effect.

Pseudocode:
```
function get_opponent_strategy(round_number, opponent_action_history):
  if round_number == r:
    last_opponent_actions = opponent_action_history[r - 1]
    if all(last_opponent_actions == "D"):
      return "D" (Defect)
    else:
      return "C" (Cooperate)
```

3. Be exploitative:
   TfTA is exploitative in the sense that it adapts to opponents' behavior, cooperating when it seems beneficial and defecting to punish defection. It takes a balanced approach between cooperation and defection by mimicking the opponent's actions while maintaining the ability to change strategies based on their history of choices. This strategy is self-protective and can lead to long-term success in repeated interactions with a wide range of opponents.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_342 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Defection (TfT-AD)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), TfT-AD cooperates to show good faith and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, TfT-AD cooperates in the current round to maintain a cooperative relationship.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, TfT-AD will defect in the current round as retaliation but will return to cooperating if the opponent switches back to cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - To avoid being taken advantage of by opponents who continuously defect, TfT-AD will defect after a certain number (D) of defections from an opponent. The value of D can be adjusted based on the number of players and the length of the game. A possible initial setting for D is n.
   - To promote cooperation in the later stages of the game when the stock gets low, TfT-AD will tend to cooperate more frequently if no defections have occurred recently (F) (for example, F=3 rounds). The probability of cooperating (Pc) can be calculated as follows:
     - If F >= D, Pc = 1.0 (always cooperate)
     - Else, Pc = 0.5 + 0.5 * ((F+1)/D)
   - To encourage opponents who have been defecting to cooperate again, TfT-AD will return to cooperation after a certain number (R) of rounds of continuous cooperation from the opponent. The value of R can be adjusted based on the number of players and the length of the game. A possible initial setting for R is n.

2. Edge Cases:
   - First round (t=1): Cooperate (C)
   - Last round (t=r): If the stock level allows, cooperate to maximize payoff; if not, defect to minimize loss
   - Intermediate rounds (2 <= t <= r-1): Adaptive decision-making based on the rules outlined above

3. Exploitative:
   - Retaliates against defection with defection to discourage continuous exploitation
   - Encourages cooperation when possible to maximize long-term payoff
   - Gradually increases cooperative tendency as the stock gets low to promote survival of the common pool resource
   - Returns to cooperation after a period of continued cooperation from an opponent, encouraging them to cooperate again in the future.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_343 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C) to allow the stock level to grow and offer a cooperative gesture, encouraging others to follow suit.
   - Subsequent Rounds (t>1):
      a) If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in this round. This maintains cooperation if it has been successful.
      b) If at least one opponent defected in the previous round, defect in this round as punishment for defection. This encourages cooperation by punishing defection and rewarding cooperation.
      c) In case of a tie (equal number of cooperators and defectors), decide based on whether the total consumption was above or below the average consumption per player in the previous round:
          i) If total consumption was above the average, defect to decrease the consumption level and potentially encourage others to cooperate.
          ii) If total consumption was below the average, cooperate to help restore the stock level and maintain cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Cooperate regardless of opponent's behavior in the previous round. This encourages cooperation even when the game is nearing its end.
   - First Round (t=1) and other edge cases where information about the opponents' previous actions is not available, default to cooperating to start building a cooperative reputation.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT-SA's adaptive nature allows it to take advantage of opponent defections by punishing them with defection in response while also maintaining cooperation when it benefits the strategy. This approach aims to maximize the strategy's payoff by leveraging both cooperative and exploitative behaviors based on the situation.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tft_sa(r, n, capacity, stock, history):
  if r == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the initial round

  opponents = count_opponents_actions(history)
  total_consumption = sum(opponents['D'])
  average_consumption = total_consumption / n

  if all(opponents['C']):  # All opponents cooperated in the previous round
    return 'C'  # Cooperate
  elif any(opponents['D']):  # At least one opponent defected in the previous round
    return 'D'  # Defect as punishment for defection
  else:  # Tie between cooperation and defection
    if total_consumption > average_consumption * n:
      return 'D'  # Defect to decrease consumption level
    else:
      return 'C'  # Cooperate to help restore the stock level

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate (play C) to demonstrate goodwill and encourage reciprocation.
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1):
      a) If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back (play C).
      b) If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (play D). This is a form of punishment intended to encourage the opponent to cooperate next time.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), cooperate regardless of the opponent's behavior in the previous round. The goal is to maximize payoff for the final round since there are no more future interactions with the opponent.
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - If the opponent defects consistently (i.e., D in every round), continue cooperating to show patience and hope for eventual reciprocation. However, if the opponent's defection continues after a certain threshold of rounds (let's say 10), start defecting as well.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The TFTA strategy has an exploitative nature by punishing opponents who do not cooperate, encouraging them to reciprocate cooperation in the future.
   - By adapting its behavior based on the opponent's history of actions, the strategy maximizes its payoff while also taking advantage of the opponent's defection, since it defects when the opponent does.
   - However, TFTA also demonstrates patience by giving opponents opportunities to cooperate and shows goodwill in the initial rounds, which may lead to long-term cooperation if reciprocated.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_345 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Forgiveness (TFT-AF)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to show goodwill and promote trust.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's action from the previous round:
     a) If opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate. This maintains the positive relationship and encourages continued cooperation.
     b) If opponent defected in the last round, defect this round to demonstrate disapproval of their action. However, implement forgiveness by changing back to cooperation if they return to cooperation in the following round. This strategy seeks to punish defection while also encouraging future cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize payoff.
   - At the start of a new game (after a loss), return to cooperating in the first round as a fresh start to encourage cooperation from the opponent.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - TFT-AF is inherently exploitative by punishing defection and rewarding cooperation. If an opponent consistently defects, the strategy will also continue to defect.
   - However, TFT-AF is not overtly exploitative as it does offer the opportunity for forgiveness and future cooperation after punishment. This could potentially lead to more sustained cooperation compared to other strictly exploitative strategies.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tft_af(round, opponent_action, game_history):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

  if round == r:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the last round to maximize payoff

  if game_history[-1] and opponent_action == 'D':
    return 'D'  # Defect if opponent defected last round, but not if it is the first time

  if opponent_action == 'C':
    return 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round

  # If opponent has been defecting repeatedly
  if opponent_defects > threshold:
    return 'D'  # Defect in response to exploitative behavior

  return 'C'  # Default action is cooperation
```

In this pseudocode, `round`, `opponent_action`, and `game_history` are provided game parameters. The opponent's defection count, `opponent_defects`, can be incremented when the opponent defects and reset at the start of a new game or after an extended series of cooperative rounds. The threshold for considering an opponent consistently exploitative should be set based on the desired balance between cooperation and punishment.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_346 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, the ATFT strategy will start by cooperating to foster a cooperative environment, following the principle of reciprocity. If an opponent cooperates, the strategy will continue cooperating. However, if an opponent ever defects, the strategy will also defect in the subsequent round and revert to cooperation only when the opponent resumes cooperating.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function ATFT(round, history):
       if first_round or previous_cooperation(history):
           action = Cooperate
       else:
           action = Defect
       return action
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, the strategy will cooperate to initiate a potential relationship with other players. As for the last round, the strategy behaves the same way as any other round since the stock level can still affect future games (if there are any) and payoffs in the current game.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While being reciprocal, the ATFT strategy is also designed to punish defectors by defecting when necessary, thereby limiting their gains. However, it promotes cooperation when possible, hoping that other players will cooperate in return. This approach can be seen as exploiting defectors while attempting to maximize payoffs in a cooperative environment.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_347 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfT-GA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), start by cooperating to build a positive relationship and encourage cooperation from others. This can be expressed as follows: `if t = 1 then action = C`

   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponents' actions in the previous round and adjust your own actions accordingly. If an opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), cooperate in the current round (t). If an opponent defected in the previous round, also defect in the current round to punish the defector. This can be expressed as follows: `if t > 1 then if action_opponent(t-1) = C then action = C else action = D`

   - To mitigate exploitation by overly aggressive opponents who constantly defect, implement a growth adaptation factor that increases your stock consumption when facing frequent defections. This factor decreases over time to encourage cooperation again. A possible implementation is as follows: `growth_factor = min(1, (t / r))` and `if action_opponent(t-1) = D then consumption = stock / (2n * growth_factor) else consumption = stock / (2n)`.
   Note that this adaptation is adaptive but not too aggressive to avoid causing excessive stock depletion.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), revert to cooperating regardless of opponents' previous actions, as there will be no future interaction. This can be expressed as follows: `if t = r then action = C`

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The TfT-GA strategy maintains a balance between cooperation and defection based on the opponents' behavior, aiming to punish defectors and encourage cooperators while minimizing stock depletion.
   - By gradually adapting consumption based on the frequency of defections, it ensures that overly aggressive opponents are not consistently exploited, but it does not guarantee long-term cooperation with other strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_348 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows for the resource pool to grow.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from previous rounds. If the opponent has been cooperating, continue cooperation. If the opponent has defected, defect in the next round. This approach fosters trust and punishes defection.
   - Implement an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT) to adjust the number of consecutive defections required before retaliation. Initially, set CT = 1. Increase or decrease CT based on the opponent's behaviour: if CT is too low (e.g., retaliating after one round of defection), and the opponent continues to defect, increase CT. If CT is too high (e.g., not retaliating after multiple rounds of defection), and the opponent starts cooperating again, decrease CT.
   - In each round, if the current stock level is below the capacity / n (i.e., scarcity), lower the CT to encourage cooperation in such situations. This allows for a more forgiving approach during times of resource shortage.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, always cooperate regardless of opponent's behaviour as there are no further interactions or repercussions.
   - In the first round, cooperate unconditionally (as mentioned above).

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-ACT strategy is inherently exploitative in its response to defection: if an opponent defects, it will retaliate and withhold cooperation until the opponent demonstrates a change in behavior.
   - By using an adaptive CT, this strategy can adjust its response based on the opponent's actions, making it more difficult for opponents to exploit consistently.
   - In situations of scarcity, the strategy becomes more forgiving by lowering the CT, allowing cooperation even when opponents have previously defected. This increases the potential payoff in such scenarios.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Forgiveness (TfT-AF)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round to signal cooperation intent and establish a cooperative environment.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's actions from previous rounds. If the opponent has been cooperating, continue to cooperate. If the opponent has defected, also defect for an equal number of rounds as the opponent's consecutive defections (i.e., revenge). After that, revert back to cooperating.
   - Implement forgiveness by resetting the revenge counter after a round of cooperation from the opponent.

Pseudocode:
```
def strategy(previous_opponent_actions, current_round, max_revenge_rounds, game_parameters):
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    else:
        forgiveness = False

    if all(previous_opponent_actions) == ['C'] and forgiveness:

    elif all(previous_opponent_actions) == ['D'] or (not forgiveness):
        return 'D'  # Defect if the opponent has defected or forgiveness is not triggered

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing total payoff by cooperating, regardless of the opponent's past actions.

Pseudocode:
```
if current_round == game_parameters['r']:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the final round to maximize total payoff
```

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TfT-AF strategy is designed to punish defections, while maintaining cooperation when it benefits the player. This approach encourages opponents to cooperate for better payoffs, but also enables a swift response when an opponent defects. Thus, the strategy can be considered as exhibiting an exploitative mindset by maximizing payoff through cooperative behavior while penalizing defection.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This gesture sets a cooperative tone and gives opponents the opportunity to reciprocate.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from previous rounds and adapt accordingly:
     - If opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate in the current round.
     - If opponent defected in the last round, defect in the current round.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize the payoff.
   - If the stock level drops below (n-1) times the consumption per player (stock ≤ (n-1)), defect in all remaining rounds as it becomes a prisoner's dilemma-like scenario with insufficient resources for continued cooperation. In this case, the strategy aims to minimize its own losses and not contribute further to the depletion of the common pool.
   - If the opponent has never cooperated in previous rounds (defected every time), defect in all remaining rounds as it is unlikely that the opponent will start cooperating at this point.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by initially promoting cooperation but quickly adapting to opponents who do not reciprocate and defecting against them. It prioritizes self-interest while still considering the potential for mutual benefit through initial cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```python

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round, evaluate the average stock level over the last 'm' rounds (where m is a constant determined experimentally). If the average is above the initial capacity, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - Start with cooperation in the first round as the initial state is optimal for all players (stock = capacity).
   - In the last round, always cooperate to maximize the payoff and leave a good stock level for future games.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In case of no past rounds (first round), cooperate as described above.
   - In case of fewer than 'm' past rounds, evaluate the average based on available data. If there are less than m rounds and the average is above capacity, continue to cooperate; otherwise, defect.

3. Exploitative Nature:
   - TfT-G is exploitative in nature as it rewards cooperation when opponents have been conserving the common pool resource but switches to defection if they have been overconsuming. This encourages opponents to maintain a sustainable consumption level, while still allowing TfT-G to profit from their mistakes.
   - By always cooperating in the last round, TfT-G punishes opponents who have defected during the game but rewards those who have cooperated. This discourages short-term exploitation and encourages long-term cooperation.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate to allow for potential future cooperation and show goodwill towards opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, calculate a Cooperative Threshold (CT) based on the average consumption rate in the past few rounds. If the opponent's consumption is below the CT, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
     ```
     function get_average_consumption(past_rounds):
         return sum(past_consumptions) / length(past_rounds)

     function calculate_cooperation_threshold():
         return (2 * n) * average_consumption
     ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - For the initial round, always cooperate as mentioned above.
   - In the last round, defect if the opponent has been consistently exploitative (average consumption > CT) to minimize losses and prepare for future interactions. Otherwise, cooperate to encourage cooperation in the next tournament.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - When opponents are cooperative, the strategy will also cooperate to benefit from their goodwill; however, if they defect or show signs of exploitation, it will retaliate by matching their actions. This approach aims to punish aggressive strategies while incentivizing cooperation when possible.
   - To become more adaptive and robust, the TFT-ACT strategy can adjust the CT based on the average consumption rate observed over the past few rounds. A lower CT allows for more cooperation when opponents demonstrate a history of low consumption, while a higher CT promotes defecting when opponents consistently deplete the common pool excessively.
     ```
     function update_cooperation_threshold(current_consumption):
         if average_consumption > current_consumption:
             return decrease_CT(current_consumption)
         else:
             return increase_CT(current_consumption)

     function decrease_CT(current_consumption):
         return (1 - learning_rate) * CT + learning_rate * current_consumption

     function increase_CT(current_consumption):
         return (1 + learning_rate) * CT - learning_rate * current_consumption
     ```

By combining these elements, the TFT-ACT strategy seeks to balance cooperation and exploitation based on the opponent's behavior while being adaptive to a wide range of scenarios.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Evolution (TfT-E) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to promote trust and collaboration (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponents' actions from the previous round and respond as follows:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C).
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (D). This is a punishment for defection and an incentive to return to cooperation.
   - In the last round, cooperate since there are no future interactions to consider.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If the game starts with more than one round, use the TfT-E strategy from the second round onwards, starting with a cooperative move in the first round (C).
   - In the last round, always cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous actions.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TfT-E strategy is exploitative as it takes advantage of opponents who repeatedly defect, punishing them with defections while rewarding cooperation. It encourages a stable cooperation-defection cycle when paired with similar strategies but exploits those that consistently defect.
   - However, the strategy also rewards cooperative behaviour, fostering trust and collaboration in potential long-term interactions with other cooperative opponents.

Pseudocode:
```
function TfT_E(round, history) {
  if round == 1 then
    return 'C' (Cooperate)
  end if

  lastRound = history[round - 1]

  if lastRound == 'C' then
    return 'C' (Cooperate)
  else
    return 'D' (Defect)
  end if
}
```

In this pseudocode, the `history` variable contains the opponents' previous actions. The function returns a Cooperate ('C') or Defect ('D') action based on the current round and the opponent's last move from the history.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, play C to demonstrate cooperation and goodwill.
   - For subsequent rounds, assess the opponent's behavior based on previous actions:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the last round, play C in the current round.
     - If the opponent defected in the last round, play D in the current round.
   - Implement a Cooperation Threshold (CT) that gradually decreases over time to become less forgiving:
     - CT = Initial_CT * (1 - (r - t)/r)
       where r is the total number of rounds and t is the current round number. This means that the CT starts high initially but drops as the game progresses, making it easier to punish opponents who defect consistently.
     - Play C only if the opponent's action in the last round was cooperative AND the difference between the current round number (t) and the opponent's cooperation count (C_count) is less than or equal to CT.
       If the condition is not met, play D to punish the opponent for defecting too often.
       Update C_count after each cooperative action by the opponent.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t = r), play C regardless of the opponent's previous actions since there are no more rounds left to punish or reward opponents.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT strategy aims to earn as many payoffs as possible while punishing opponents who consistently defect, thereby encouraging cooperation when feasible and exploiting opponents who do not reciprocate cooperation.
   - By gradually lowering the CT, the strategy becomes more aggressive in responding to defections, making it less forgiving over time. This encourages opponents to cooperate or face harsh consequences.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Greed (TfTG) Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, TfTG starts by cooperating to allow the stock to grow in subsequent rounds (C).
   - For all other rounds (t > 1), if the current average consumption per player is less than the optimal consumption for a single player (stock / n), TfTG will cooperate (C). If not, it will defect (D) to exploit the situation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, TfTG will follow the average consumption rule as in regular rounds. However, if the stock is depleted, it will still cooperate (since there are no more rounds left).
   - In the first round, if the initial stock is less than 2n (the minimum sustainable level), TfTG will defect to ensure survival.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by adapting to other players' behaviors. If opponents cooperate, it benefits from their generosity by defecting when they do. Conversely, if opponents are selfish and continuously deplete the stock, TfTG will also defect to survive.

Pseudocode for TfTG:

```
def TitForTatGreed(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1 and stock >= 2 * n:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TfT-AC)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to allow the stock to grow and establish trust. This can potentially lead opponents to also cooperate in future rounds. [C]
   - If an opponent defects in a round, defect in the next round as punishment (Tit-for-Tat). However, there's an adaptive element: if the opponent has recently cooperated and then defected, there's a chance of forgiveness by cooperating again. The probability of forgiveness increases with the number of consecutive cooperations before the defection.
   - If an opponent has been cooperative for n-1 rounds (except for the first round), cooperate in the current round to maintain the cooperative relationship. [C]
   - In all other cases, defect. [D]

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Defect as the game ends soon and there's no opportunity for retaliation or forgiveness.
   - If an opponent has never cooperated before (i.e., they only play D), always defect.

Pseudocode:

```python
class TfT_AC:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.forgiveness_window = 2 * n - 1
        self.cooperation_streak = 0

    def decide(self, opponent_actions, round):
        if round == 1:
            return "C"  # cooperate in the first round
        elif opponent_actions[-1] == "D":  # defect if opponent defected last round
            self.cooperation_streak = max(0, self.cooperation_streak - 1)
            return "D"
        elif self.cooperation_streak >= self.forgiveness_window:  # if opponent has been uncooperative for too long
            return "D"
        elif round == len(opponent_actions) and self.cooperation_streak > 0:  # last round, only defect
            return "D"
        elif opponent_actions[-1] == "C":  # if opponent cooperated last round
            self.cooperation_streak += 1
        else:  # if opponent did not cooperate last round or it's the first interaction
            self.cooperation_streak = max(0, self.cooperation_streak - 1)
        return "C" if self.cooperation_streak >= n - 1 else "D"  # cooperate if cooperation streak is enough to forgive or not cooperate otherwise
```

The strategy TfT-AC is exploitative as it takes advantage of opponents who are uncooperative, while being forgiving to those that show signs of cooperation. It also encourages cooperation by being cooperative at the start and maintaining cooperation if an opponent shows a streak of cooperation. However, the strategy will punish opponents who repeatedly defect to prevent them from exploiting the strategy itself.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-ACT starts by cooperating in the first round, mimicking the cooperative spirit inherent in the game. For subsequent rounds:
   - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, cooperate. This maintains a cooperative environment if others are also following this strategy.
   - If any opponent defected in the previous round, defect. This is the exploitative part of the strategy; it punishes defection while maintaining cooperation when appropriate.
   - To avoid being too strict or lenient with cooperation, an Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT) is introduced. If more than 50% (floor((n+1)/2)) of opponents defected in the previous round, increase the threshold for cooperation (i.e., require more cooperative opponents to consider cooperating). Conversely, if less than or equal to 50% of opponents defected, decrease the threshold for cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier. For the last round, TFT-ACT continues to follow the previous rule (cooperate if all opponents cooperated in the previous round). However, if reaching the last round and less than 50% of opponents have cooperated in any previous rounds, defect to ensure a high payoff in the final round.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TFT-ACT exhibits an exploitative approach by punishing defection through non-cooperation while maintaining cooperation when others do so. The Adaptive Cooperation Threshold provides flexibility to adjust to different opponent behaviors and populations, making it robust against a wide range of strategies.

Pseudocode:

```

  cooperation_threshold = floor((n+1)/2)
  num_cooperators = count Cooperate in previous_actions

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TfT-ACT starts by cooperating in the first round, mimicking a cooperative approach to encourage others to cooperate. In subsequent rounds, it uses an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT) that considers both the current stock level and history of opponent actions. If the current stock is above CT, cooperate; otherwise, defect. The cooperation threshold is initially set low (50% of the maximum sustainable stock), and it increases or decreases based on the opponent's behavior over several rounds:
   - If the opponent cooperates in a round where TfT-ACT would have cooperated as well, leave CT unchanged.
   - If the opponent defects when TfT-ACT would have cooperated, decrease CT slightly to encourage cooperation in the next round.
   - If the opponent cooperates when TfT-ACT would have defected, increase CT slightly to discourage excessive cooperation in the next round.
   This adaptive strategy allows TfT-ACT to react to the opponent's behavior while still maintaining a cooperative bias.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TfT-ACT cooperates as described above. For the last round, since there are no future rounds to consider, TfT-ACT defects if the current stock is below CT and cooperates otherwise.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While TfT-ACT maintains a cooperative bias, it also adapts its cooperation threshold based on opponent behavior to punish defections and encourage cooperation when it benefits the strategy. This approach allows TfT-ACT to be robust against various opponent strategies while still exploiting their mistakes.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_ACT(n, r, capacity, current_stock, opponent_history):
    CT = current_stock * 0.5
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        last_opponent_action = opponent_history[-1]  # Get the most recent action of the opponent
        if last_opponent_action == 'C':  # If the opponent cooperated, leave CT unchanged
            action = chooseActionBasedOnCT(CT, current_stock)
        else:  # Otherwise, adjust CT based on opponent's behavior
            if actionBasedOnCT(CT, current_stock) == 'C':  # If TfT-ACT would have cooperated
                CT *= (1 - punishmentFactor)  # Decrease CT to encourage cooperation
            else:  # If TfT-ACT would have defected
                CT *= (1 + rewardFactor)  # Increase CT to discourage excessive cooperation
            action = chooseActionBasedOnCT(CT, current_stock)  # Choose action based on new CT
    return action

def chooseActionBasedOnCT(CT, current_stock):
    if current_stock > CT:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate when the current stock is above CT
    else:
        action = 'D'  # Defect when the current stock is below CT
    return action
```

In the pseudocode above, `punishmentFactor` and `rewardFactor` are parameters that control how aggressively TfT-ACT adjusts its cooperation threshold based on opponent behavior. These factors can be set to achieve different levels of exploitation or cooperation depending on the desired strategy balance.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), TFTSA starts by cooperating (C). This encourages potential partners for mutual cooperation in later rounds, which can lead to higher payoffs.
   - From the second round onwards (t>1), TFTSA maintains its current strategy based on the opponent's actions in the previous round:
      a) If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, TFTSA cooperates in the current round as well (C). This is an act of reciprocity and encourages continued cooperation.
      b) If the opponent defected in the previous round, TFTSA defects in the current round (D). This is a punishment for the opponent's previous action, but it also preserves TFTSA's stock level by consuming less than if it cooperated.
   - In case of a tie (all opponents or none cooperate), TFTSA chooses to defect (D) as a precautionary measure to protect its stock level.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): As the game is repeated, TFTSA will have learned from its interactions and make informed decisions based on the opponent's past behavior. In the last round, it will apply the same decision rules as in regular rounds (t>1).
   - First Round (t=1): Since there is no previous history to base decisions on, TFTSA starts by cooperating (C) and hopes that other players will follow suit, promoting mutual cooperation.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - In this strategy, exploitation is inherent in the response to the opponent's actions. If an opponent defects, TFTSA defects back, which reduces the opponent's payoff but also ensures that TFTSA does not overconsume from the common pool.
   - By starting with cooperation (C) and adapting its behavior based on the opponent's previous actions, TFTSA encourages continued mutual cooperation when possible but also punishes defection in an exploitative manner.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows for stock growth.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's behavior from previous rounds to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
     - If opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate (C) to maintain cooperation and promote stock growth.
     - If opponent defected in the last round, defect (D) as retaliation and reduce their resources.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since the game ends immediately after that, there is no need for a response to the opponent's previous move. Therefore, cooperate (C) in the last round to maximize potential payoff.
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate (C).

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFT-SA is designed to be exploitative by punishing opponent's defections with defection and rewarding cooperation with cooperation. The goal is to create a win-win situation when possible, but also to punish opponents who attempt to exploit the strategy.
   - However, it should be noted that TFT-SA is not solely focused on maximizing personal payoff. It also aims to maintain a sustainable stock level in the long run by promoting cooperation and preventing overexploitation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round and initial stages, cooperate to foster cooperation and build trust (C).
   - If an opponent cooperates in a round, cooperate back in the next round (C).
   - If an opponent defects in a round, defect in the following round unless the stock level is below a certain threshold (D).
   - The cooperation threshold (CT) adjusts over time based on the average cooperation of opponents in the recent past.
     - When CT < 0.5, always cooperate.
     - When CT > 0.5, always defect.
     - Linear interpolation between 0 and 1 is used when CT = 0.5.
   - Periodically update the average cooperation to account for short-term fluctuations.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since the game ends regardless of actions taken, cooperate to maximize potential payoff (C).
   - If the stock level is zero, defect as there's no benefit in cooperating (D).
   - If an opponent never cooperates, continuously defect to punish and deter future attempts at cooperation (D).

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By initially cooperating and adjusting cooperation based on opponents' actions, TFT-ACT encourages cooperation when possible but can also swiftly retaliate against defection. This strategy exploits opponents who are prone to both cooperation and defection, as it provides a potential benefit during initial stages while also being prepared to punish when necessary.
   - The adaptive cooperation threshold ensures that the strategy becomes more aggressive over time if opponents consistently defect, while still offering opportunities for cooperation in response to cooperation from opponents.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growing (TfT-G) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, compare the average stock consumption per player over the previous (r/2) rounds (if r is even) or the last complete cycle of r rounds. If the average consumption is below a certain threshold (T), cooperate; otherwise, defect. This threshold (T) should be set such that it encourages cooperation when resources are abundant but punishes excessive consumption to promote conservation when resources are scarce.
   - To calculate T, take an initial value slightly lower than the sustainable consumption per player in a fully cooperative round (i.e., T = 0.9 * stock / (2n)). Adjust this value based on the opponent's behavior during the game. If the average consumption is consistently above or below T, gradually move T towards the opposing extreme to encourage a change in their strategy.
   - If it's the first round, start with a 50% probability of cooperating and a 50% probability of defecting.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, always cooperate as there will be no further growth or punishment in the next rounds.
   - If the game is short (r < r/2), use heuristics such as a higher initial T to encourage cooperation and a slower adjustment of T based on opponent behavior.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Cooperate only when others do so, but punish excessive consumption by defecting. This strategy aims to incentivize conservation and cooperation when resources are abundant while encouraging opponents to moderate their consumption during scarcity.
   - By adjusting the threshold T based on the opponent's behavior, the strategy learns and adapts to various playstyles, making it more difficult for opponents to exploit the TfT-G strategy.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Plus Growth (TfT+G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to start with a fair offer and build trust. (C)
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate opponent's behavior by keeping track of their actions in the last t rounds (t ≥ 1).
     - If the opponent has been cooperating for at least t rounds, cooperate to maintain the cooperation cycle. (C)
     - If the opponent has defected at any point during the past t rounds, also defect to retaliate and signal discontent with their behavior. (D)
   - To adapt to different values of t, use a sliding window approach where you consider the most recent t rounds as significant, with t dynamically adjusting based on the current round number (r). For example, use a window size equal to r/2 in the middle of the game (when r is even), and a smaller window size like r/4 near the beginning and end of the game.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no future interactions, defect regardless of opponent's behavior to maximize immediate payoff. (D)
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier. (C)

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The TfT+G strategy aims to establish a cooperation cycle but will also retaliate when necessary to punish defectors and encourage cooperation. However, it is important to note that this strategy is not purely exploitative in the sense of always trying to gain more than other players at any cost. Instead, it seeks to find a balance between cooperation and punishment to maximize payoff over the course of multiple rounds while being robust against various opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:

```
function TfT+G(round, window_size) {
  // Maintain a sliding window of the last 'window_size' moves
  window = deque(window_size)
  // If it's the first round, cooperate to build trust
  if (round == 1) {

  // Add current move to the sliding window
  window.addLast(move)

  // Adjust window size dynamically based on game length
  if (round <= window_size * 2) {

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to start fresh and demonstrate a cooperative intention.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior in the previous round:
       - If opponent cooperated, continue cooperating until the stock level falls below the defined threshold (T).
       - If opponent defected, defect in the next round as a punishment. After defection, resume cooperating when the stock level falls below T.
       - If the opponent has been continuously cooperative since the last defection, increase T slightly to incentivize future cooperation while maintaining some self-interest. Conversely, if the opponent has repeatedly defected, decrease T to encourage more punishment and discourage defection.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff based on the current stock level and T value. Cooperate if the stock level is above T, otherwise defect. This ensures a final act of cooperation when it benefits the most or retaliation in case the opponent has depleted the resources.
   - If the stock level reaches zero (indicating overexploitation), reset T to a moderate value and immediately defect to help restore the common pool, as the focus is on long-term exploitation rather than immediate gains when the resource is nearly depleted.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The strategy aims to take advantage of cooperative opponents by reciprocating cooperation while punishing defection. By adjusting the cooperation threshold dynamically, TFT-ACT adapts to various opponent behaviors and promotes cooperation when it benefits the most while maintaining self-interest. This ensures a balance between exploitation and cooperation for long-term success in the repeated game.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (TfT) with Adaptive Forgiveness (A-TfT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), player i cooperates (plays C). This is a peace offering to encourage potential cooperation partners.
   - From t=2 to r, player i will copy the opponent's action from the previous round (i.e., if opponent cooperated, player i cooperates; if opponent defected, player i defects).
   - If an opponent ever defects, player i will defect for the remaining rounds (punishment phase). After a certain number of forgiveness steps f (explained below), player i will revert to cooperating again.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round (t=r): No need for punishment or forgiveness as the game ends soon. Player i will copy the opponent's action from the previous round.
   - If a round t results in stock depletion (New stock = 0), player i defects since cooperation is not feasible. Then, player i waits for f forgiveness steps before resuming cooperative behavior.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy maintains a balance between cooperation and punishment to encourage long-term mutual cooperation while also being ready to punish opponents who defect.
   - The forgiveness parameter f can be set to a small number (e.g., 2-5) to ensure that player i does not forgive too many defections, thus maintaining an exploitative edge.

Pseudocode:

```python
def A_TfT(i, t, opponents_actions, f=3):
    if t==1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif t < r and opponents_actions[t-1][i-1] == 'C':
        action = 'C'  # Copy opponent's cooperation from previous round
    elif t < r and opponents_actions[t-1][i-1] == 'D':
        action = 'D'  # Punish opponent by defecting
    else:  # Last round or stock depletion
        action = opponents_actions[t-1][i-1]  # Copy opponent's action from previous round

    if action == 'C' and len(defected_rounds) >= f:
        reset_defected_rounds()  # Reset defected_rounds after forgiveness steps

    return action

def reset_defected_rounds():
    global defected_rounds
    defected_rounds = []
```

In the above pseudocode, `opponents_actions` is a 2D list where `opponents_actions[t][i-1]` contains action taken by opponent i in round t. Additionally, `defected_rounds` is a global list used to keep track of defecting rounds for the purpose of calculating forgiveness steps.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to demonstrate good faith and allow the common pool to grow.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's action from the previous round. If they cooperated, reciprocate with cooperation; if they defected, defect as well. This simple yet effective strategy mirrors the exploitative mindset: cooperate when partners cooperate, but retaliate when partners defect.
   - To avoid getting trapped in a cycle of defection (the "trigger" strategy), introduce forgiveness by cooperating after three consecutive rounds of defection from the opponent. This represents an attempt to re-establish cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, choose cooperation regardless of the opponent's previous action because the game will end soon anyway and it may encourage continued cooperation in future interactions.
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier.
   - When facing a new opponent or restarting a game with an existing one, follow the rule for the first round (cooperate).

Pseudocode:
```
function TitForTat(opponentAction, round, r, n, capacity):
  if round == 1:
    return C

  if round < r:
    if opponentAction == C and lastRoundCooperation != C:
      lastRoundCooperation = C
      return C

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Adaptive Strategy (TFT-A) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, evaluate the opponent's behaviour over a sliding window of past rounds. If the opponent has been cooperative in most of the recent past (e.g., 3 out of the last 5 rounds), TFT-A will cooperate. Otherwise, it will defect.

```
function TFT_A(history) : Action
    if (history.length < 5) then return C (Cooperate)
    windowSize = 5
    numberOfCs = countCooperativeActionsInWindow(history, windowSize)
    if (numberOfCs >= 3) then return C
    else return D
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, since there is no history, TFT-A will cooperate as a goodwill gesture. In the last round, it will follow the decision rule based on the history gathered during the game.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   By adapting to the opponent's behaviour, TFT-A aims to maximize its payoff by cooperating when opponents do so and defecting when it expects them to defect (punishing defection). This strategy can lead to exploitation since it takes advantage of an opponent's cooperation while not being too generous itself.

When playing against other strategies, TFT-A will observe their tendencies and adjust its cooperation/defection decisions accordingly, making it a robust and adaptive strategy in various scenarios.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TFTG) Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

TFTG follows a tit-for-tat approach with growth dynamics consideration, aiming to maximize short-term gains while promoting long-term sustainability:

- Initially (Round 1), Cooperate to contribute positively to the common pool and allow it to grow.
- In response to another player's cooperation (Cooperative Round), Cooperate. This promotes mutual benefit and fosters a cooperative environment.
- If a player defected in the previous round (Defective Round), Defect in return, punishing the defector while still considering stock growth.
- When the common pool is depleted or critically low, prioritize Cooperating to help rebuild the resource and ensure its sustainability.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFTG(round, opponent_action_history, capacity, n):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    if last_opponent_action == 'C':  # If opponent cooperated last round
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in response to cooperation

    if last_opponent_action == 'D' and (stock / capacity) < 0.6:  # If opponent defected and the pool is critically low
        return 'C'  # Cooperate to help rebuild the resource

    if last_opponent_action == 'D':  # If opponent defected but the pool isn't critically low
        return 'D'  # Defect in response to defection

    return '?'  # Invalid state, handle as error
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the final (last) round, prioritize Cooperating even if the opponent defected in the previous round to maximize payoff:

Pseudocode:
```
def TFTG(round, opponent_action_history, capacity, n):
    # ... (rest of the function)

    if round == r:  # If it's the last round
        return 'C'  # Always Cooperate in the last round
    else:
        return pseudocode from above
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

TFTG is inherently exploitative by punishing defectors, encouraging cooperation when it benefits the strategy, and cooperating strategically to help rebuild the common pool if needed. This approach maximizes short-term gains while promoting long-term sustainability, effectively balancing exploitation with cooperation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_369 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy called "Freeloader-TitForTat-Growth (FTFG)." The FTFG strategy is designed to be exploitative while adapting to a wide range of opponent behaviors.

1. Decision rules:
   - In the first round, start by cooperating to avoid depleting the common pool too quickly and potentially risking lower payoffs in future rounds due to insufficient stock. (cooperate on turn 1)
   - After the initial round, evaluate the average consumption per player over the previous r-1 rounds. If the average consumption is below (n-1)/2*capacity/(2n), cooperate; otherwise defect. This decision rule incentivizes cooperation when others are also conserving resources but switches to exploitation when opponents deplete the stock excessively.
   - In the last round, defect since there will be no further growth or interaction with other players. (defect on turn r)

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the first round, there are no previous rounds to consider, so cooperate as mentioned above.
   - If the average consumption per player cannot be calculated due to insufficient data (r-1 < 2), cooperate in the initial rounds and then follow the decision rule from step 1 starting from the third round onwards.

3. Being exploitative:
   - FTFG is designed to conserve resources when others do the same, but it will defect when opponents deplete the common pool excessively. This strategy encourages cooperation when it benefits the player while still being prepared to exploit overly cooperative opponents. By following this approach, FTFG maintains a balanced combination of cooperation and defection that aligns with an exploitative mindset.

Pseudocode:

```python
def FTFG(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C' # Cooperate in the first round
  else:
    avg_consumption = sum(history[-r+1:-1]) / (r-1)
    if avg_consumption < (n-1)*capacity/(2*n):
      action = 'C' # Cooperate when others conserve resources
    else:
        action = 'D' # Defect when opponents deplete the stock excessively
  return action
```
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_370 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round (C). This encourages cooperation and reduces initial stock depletion.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the average proportion of defections (p_d) among all players over the past 'm' rounds (m is a tunable parameter).
   - If p_d < threshold, cooperate (C); otherwise defect (D). The threshold is dynamically adjusted based on the current round number 't' and the average proportion of defections so far. It is calculated as follows:
     ```
     Threshold = (t / r) * max(p_d - 0.2, 0) + 0.2
     ```
     This threshold adjusts during the game to be more tolerant of initial defections but becomes increasingly intolerant over time. The 0.2 value provides a minimum level of cooperation in all rounds.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no future rounds for retaliation, always cooperate (C).
   - If p_d is not defined due to insufficient past rounds ('m' < r), use a default threshold of 0.2 and gradually adapt it as more data becomes available.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By initially cooperating and gradually adapting the cooperation threshold, this strategy aims to encourage cooperation in the early stages while becoming increasingly punitive towards defectors over time. This can incentivize opponents to adopt less exploitative strategies or risk receiving lower payoffs.
   - The dynamic threshold also allows for some level of forgiveness in the early game, making it more resilient against occasional defections without compromising its exploitative nature.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_371 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Rate (TTFCR)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to establish trust and demonstrate goodwill.
   - In subsequent rounds, adjust the cooperation rate based on opponent's actions from previous rounds.
   - If an opponent cooperates, maintain cooperation at a constant rate (default rate) for several rounds.
   - If an opponent defects, respond with defection for a punishment phase equal to the default punishment length. After the punishment phase, revert to the cooperation rate for several rounds.
   - The default cooperation rate and default punishment length should be determined empirically to maximize payoff based on the game parameters (n, r, capacity).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of opponent's previous actions since there are no further rounds for retaliation or reciprocity.
   - In the first round, cooperate as specified above.
   - If an opponent switches from cooperation to defection after a long period of mutual cooperation, reduce the default punishment length and increase the default cooperation rate slightly to encourage the opponent to return to cooperation.
   - If an opponent consistently defects and causes a rapid depletion of resources, adapt the strategy by reducing the default cooperation rate and increasing the default punishment length to protect against further losses.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TTFCR strategy is inherently exploitative as it seeks to maintain cooperation only when reciprocated, and punish defection with a temporary decrease in cooperation.
   - Additionally, the adaptive nature of the strategy allows it to respond dynamically to different opponent behaviors, making it difficult for other strategies to take advantage of TTFCR's predictability.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ttfcr(n, r, capacity, default_coop_rate, default_punish_len):
    stock = capacity
    cooperation_history = [True] * r  # True represents cooperation, False represents defection
    punishment_history = []

    for round in range(1, r + 1):
        if round == 1:
            cooperate = True  # Cooperate initially to establish trust
        else:
            cooperate = cooperation_history[round - 1]  # Maintain current cooperation or revert to previous defection

        if cooperate:  # If cooperating, add to stock according to the action set
            stock += stock / (2 * n)
        else:  # If defecting, subtract from stock according to the action set
            stock -= stock / n

        growth = 2 * stock * ((capacity - stock) / capacity)  # Calculate stock dynamics
        new_stock = min(stock + growth, capacity)  # Update stock level with growth and capacity constraints

        if round > default_punish_len and not cooperate:  # If in the punishment phase, revert to cooperation
            cooperate = True

        cooperation_history.append(cooperate)  # Record this round's cooperation status

        if not cooperate and round + default_punish_len < r:  # If defecting and there are more rounds, remember the round for punishment phase reversion
            punishment_history.append(round + default_punish_len)

    payoff = sum([stock / (2 * n) if cooperation_history[t] else stock / n for t in range(r)])

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to build a positive relationship and encourage cooperation from opponents (C).
   - If an opponent cooperates in the current round, return the favor by cooperating in the next round (C if previous action was C, D if previous action was D). This encourages long-term cooperation but also punishes defection.
   - If an opponent defects in the current round and the number of rounds remaining is more than a predefined threshold (r_threshold), respond with cooperation to incentivize future cooperation (C). This minimizes immediate harm caused by short-term defections while fostering long-term cooperation.
   - If an opponent defects in the current round and the number of rounds remaining is equal to or less than r_threshold, defect in response to punish defection (D). This demonstrates a hardline stance towards repeated defection in the late game.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, defect since there will be no future interactions to consider (D).
   - If the current stock is less than or equal to zero due to past overconsumption, start cooperating in the hope that others will do the same to rebuild the resource (C).
   - If the current opponent's strategy cannot be inferred from previous rounds, assume cooperation initially and respond adaptively as per the specified rules.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATfT(round, r_threshold, opponent_actions, stock):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

  elif round < r_threshold:
    if opponent_actions[-1] == "C":
      action = opponent_actions[-1]  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
    else:
      action = "D"  # Defect if opponent defected last round

  elif round >= r_threshold and stock > 0:
    if opponent_actions[-1] == "C":
      action = "C"  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
    else:
      action = "D"  # Defect if opponent defected last round

  elif stock <= 0:
    action = "C"  # Cooperation to rebuild the resource

  else:  # Last round or unknown opponent behavior
    action = "D"  # Default to defection in these cases

  return action
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy starts by being cooperative, but it also punishes defection by either short-term retaliation (when r_threshold is low) or long-term punishment (when r_threshold is high). This encourages opponents to cooperate, but if they defect, the strategy ensures that it does not suffer too much in the short term and can punish repeatedly defecting opponents.
   - The strategy's adaptive nature allows it to respond effectively against a wide range of opponent behaviors, making it robust and potentially exploitative. It adjusts its approach based on the number of remaining rounds, as well as past actions by opponents, ensuring that it adapts to their behavior while maintaining an exploitative edge.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Stock-Based Cooperation (TFT-ASC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C). This gives the opponent a chance to cooperate and builds trust.
   - If the stock level is below a threshold (stock_threshold), always defect (D). The low stock indicates scarcity and survival becomes more important.
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, also defect in the current round (punishment). This encourages opponents to cooperate when they have co-operated previously.
   - If the opponent has consistently cooperated for a certain number of rounds (cooperation_threshold), and the stock level is above the threshold, also start cooperating (reward). This rewards cooperation and may encourage future cooperation from the opponent.
   - If the round is the last round, always cooperate regardless of circumstances to maximize final payoff.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_ASC(round, stock, stock_threshold, cooperation_threshold):
    strategy = "C"  # Cooperate as default

    if round == 1:
        strategy = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

    elif round != r and stock < stock_threshold:
        strategy = "D"  # Defect when stock is low

    elif round > 1 and opponent_history[-1] == "D":
        strategy = "D"  # Punish defection from the previous round

    elif round > 1 and len(cooperative_streak) >= cooperation_threshold:
        if stock > stock_threshold:
            strategy = "C"  # Reward cooperation

    elif round == r:
        strategy = "C"  # Cooperate in the last round

    return strategy
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - The strategy handles the first and last rounds separately.
   - It also considers the game dynamics by taking into account the stock level, opponent's history, and cooperation streak.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy starts with cooperating to encourage opponents to cooperate, but it punishes defection from previous rounds (punishment).
   - When the stock is low, the strategy defects to ensure survival (selfishness).
   - If an opponent has consistently cooperated and the stock level is above a certain threshold, the strategy starts cooperating (reward). This is not entirely exploitative but may help build a more cooperative relationship with consistent cooperators. However, if the opponent deviates from cooperation after this, the strategy will punish them.
   - The strategy is adaptive as it adjusts its actions based on stock level, opponent's history, and cooperation streak. It is robust to a wide range of opponent behaviours, as it can punish defection, reward cooperation, and take into account the current state of the common pool resource.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Greed (TFT-AG)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to provide a cooperative initial gesture.
   - For subsequent rounds:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back. This maintains cooperation if the opponent is also following a cooperative strategy like Tit-for-Tat (TFT).
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect to punish the defection and encourage future cooperation.
   - To be more adaptive and greedy:
     - If the stock level drops below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), always defect to preserve resources regardless of the opponent's action in the previous round. This ensures resource survival when the common pool is scarce, aligning with an exploitative mindset.
     - When the number of remaining rounds is less than a certain threshold (e.g., 10% of total rounds), always cooperate to maximize payoff at the end.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - For the last round, follow the adaptive greed rule for preserving resources and maximizing payoffs.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - By defecting when resources are scarce (threshold < 50% of capacity), TFT-AG ensures it does not contribute to overconsumption that could lead to resource depletion, which is beneficial for long-term survival in repeated games.
   - By cooperating in the last few rounds, TFT-AG maximizes its payoff when the game nears its end. This exploits the cooperation of others and aligns with a short-term exploitative approach while maintaining some level of cooperation to avoid being permanently punished by opponents.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The ATfT strategy starts by being cooperative and willing to contribute to the common pool.
   - However, if an opponent takes advantage of this goodwill by defecting, the strategy will punish them by defecting in response, teaching the opponent that selfish behavior will not go unpunished.
   - If the opponent learns from their mistake and begins cooperating again, the ATfT strategy will cooperate as well, potentially rebuilding a mutually beneficial relationship.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, TFTSA starts by cooperating (C). If the opponent cooperates back in the same round, TFTSA continues to cooperate. If the opponent defects (D), TFTSA also defects in the current round as a punitive measure. From the next round onwards, TFTSA adapts its behavior based on the average stock level over the previous r-2 rounds:
   - If the average stock level is above the capacity/n (optimal sustainable level), TFTSA cooperates to take advantage of the abundance.
   - If the average stock level is below capacity/2n, TFTSA defects to help restore the depleted common pool. In all other cases, TFTSA continues to mirror the opponent's actions from the previous round.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFTSA(round, current_stock, average_stock):
    if round = 1:
        return C

    if opponent's action in (round-1) == C and average_stock > capacity / n:
        return C
    elif opponent's action in (round-1) == D and average_stock < capacity / 2n:
        return D
    else:
        return opponent's action in (round-1)
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   TFTSA cooperates in the first round to initiate cooperation. In the last round, TFTSA adopts a forgiving approach by always cooperating regardless of the opponent's actions and average stock level. This is done to encourage long-term cooperation and avoid ending the game with depleted resources.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   Although TFTSA aims for mutual cooperation, it has an exploitative aspect by adapting its behavior based on the average stock level over previous rounds. By cooperating when the common pool is abundant and defecting when it's depleted, TFTSA aims to maximize its payoffs while still promoting cooperation in the long run. The strategy incentivizes opponents to maintain a healthy stock level for mutual benefit but punishes excessive consumption or hoarding of resources by defecting.

1. Decision Rules:
   - In every round i, starting from the second round, if all opponents cooperated in the previous round, cooperate. If any opponent defected or there is no history, defect.
   - If an opponent switched from cooperation to defection, wait for one round and then mimic their action in the next round. Continue this pattern until the opponent switches back to cooperation, then resume cooperating.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, defect as there is no history.
   - In the last round, if all opponents have cooperated up to this point, continue cooperating. Otherwise, defect to maximize payoff in the final round.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - This strategy primarily focuses on reciprocity and punishing defection to encourage cooperation while also taking advantage of opponents who frequently defect. It is less susceptible to exploitation compared to purely cooperative or purely defective strategies, making it a robust choice in a tournament setting.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This sets a positive tone for potential cooperation in future rounds and avoids immediate punishment for defecting against the opponent.
   - After the first round, maintain a Cooperative History Threshold (CHT), which is initially set to 1 (meaning one round of previous cooperation is required for current cooperation). Adjust CHT dynamically based on the average percentage of cooperative actions by opponents over the past few rounds.
     - If the percentage of opponent's cooperative actions exceeds the CHT, cooperate (C).
     - If the percentage falls below CHT, defect (D) to punish the opponent for not cooperating enough.
   - If there is no history yet (i.e., in the first round), always cooperate (C).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Since players cannot predict if this is truly the last round, maintain the CHT and base decisions on the average cooperation percentage of previous rounds.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT exhibits an exploitative mindset by punishing opponents who do not cooperate enough (i.e., defecting when necessary to teach them a lesson). However, it also encourages cooperation when there is a history of mutual agreement.
   - By adjusting the CHT based on recent opponent behavior, TFT-ACT can be more forgiving initially but becomes less lenient as time goes by if opponents continue to defect. This allows for better exploitation while still maintaining the possibility of future cooperation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, start by cooperating to foster a cooperative environment.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior in the previous round:
     - If the opponent cooperated, return the favor and cooperate.
     - If the opponent defected, calculate the cooperation ratio (CR) as the average amount of cooperation from both players over the previous rounds.
       - If CR > Threshold, defect to punish the opponent for their uncooperative behavior.
       - If CR <= Threshold, cooperate to encourage future cooperation.
     - Adjust the Threshold based on the opponent's average cooperation ratio and the number of rounds remaining:
       - If the opponent has been mostly cooperative (average CR > 0.5), lower the Threshold to allow for more forgiveness.
       - If the opponent has been mostly uncooperative (average CR < 0.5), raise the Threshold to require more cooperation from the opponent before responding in kind.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, defect regardless of the opponent's behavior since there are no further rounds for retaliation or reconciliation.

3. Be exploitative - TFT-ACT maintains a cooperative demeanor but adapts to the opponent's strategies by adjusting its cooperation threshold dynamically. This strategy is designed to punish uncooperative opponents and reward cooperative ones, promoting a cooperative equilibrium when possible, while still being robust against different opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_ACT(opponent_strategy, r, n, capacity):

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, the agent will always cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and encourages reciprocity from other agents.
   - For subsequent rounds, the agent will copy the action of the opponent from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, the agent will also cooperate; if the opponent defected, the agent will defect. This rule encourages cooperation but retaliates when exploited.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, the agent will always cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to preserve any remaining resource for future rounds (if applicable).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The TFT strategy initially fosters cooperation but quickly adapts to punish defection and encourages opponents to return to cooperation. By doing so, it can prevent other agents from repeatedly defecting while still maintaining a cooperative stance. This is an effective approach to discourage exploitation and encourage reciprocal behavior in the long run.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tft_strategy(round, own_action_history, opponent_action_history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

    if round == r:  # Last round, always cooperate
        return 'C'

    if own_action_history[-1] == 'C':  # If the agent cooperated last round, cooperate this round
        return 'C'
    else:  # Else copy opponent's last action
        return opponent_action_history[-1]
```
This strategy aims to promote cooperation while also being responsive to the actions of opponents. By adapting its behavior based on the previous actions, it can effectively discourage exploitation and encourage reciprocal behavior over repeated interactions.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initial round: Start by cooperating (C). This establishes a peaceful and cooperative atmosphere, potentially inducing cooperation from opponents in subsequent rounds.
   - Subsequent rounds: Analyze the previous round's behavior of each opponent i, noting whether they cooperated (C) or defected (D). If more than half of the players cooperated, follow their lead and continue to cooperate; otherwise, defect (D). This encourages cooperation but punishes excessive defection.
   - Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT): Maintain a running total of the average number of opponents that have cooperated in the past 't' rounds. If the current round's cooperation tally exceeds the threshold (t), follow the lead and cooperate; otherwise, defect. The threshold 't' should be a small integer, allowing for quick adjustments to opponent behavior while minimizing overreaction to temporary deviations.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Continue to use the ACT rule as described above, but with the understanding that there will be no further rounds or growth in stock. Cooperation may still lead to better payoffs if most opponents have cooperated throughout the game.
   - First round: Start by cooperating as described in the decision rules.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adapting to the behavior of other players, TFT-ACT seeks to exploit their cooperation whenever possible while still maintaining a cooperative stance when it is beneficial or could encourage further cooperation.
   - When opponents repeatedly defect, TFT-ACT will gradually respond with defection as well, punishing excessive selfishness and potentially encouraging them to reconsider their strategy.
   - The adaptive cooperation threshold allows for quick adjustments in response to changes in opponent behavior, ensuring that the strategy remains robust and effective against a wide range of strategies, including mixed or dynamic ones.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_ACT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    cooperation_threshold = 3 # Adjust this parameter based on desired responsiveness
    past_cooperation_count = [0] * n
    past_rounds = [history[-1]] + history[:-1]

    for round in range(r):
        if round == 0:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TfTAC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to foster a potential partnership and show good faith.
   - For subsequent rounds, maintain cooperation if the opponent also cooperates in the previous round; defect if the opponent defected. This mirrors the classic Tit-for-Tat strategy but with an added twist:
     - If the total consumption exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 90% of capacity), temporarily switch to defection for one round to help the common pool recover, and then revert back to cooperating if the opponent does so as well. This is intended to prevent the stock from depleting too quickly due to overconsumption by opponents who may have a tendency to defect.
     - If the stock drops below a minimum level (e.g., 50% of capacity), temporarily increase cooperation intensity by consuming less than the opponent, aiming to help restore the common pool faster. This is intended to recover from periods of overexploitation more quickly.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action, as there are no further rounds to punish or reward the opponent.
   - In the first round, cooperate as previously mentioned.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TfTAC maintains an exploitative mindset by taking advantage of opponents who consistently cooperate (extracting resources while maintaining cooperation), and by retaliating against opponents who defect (reducing their payoff).
   - The temporary switches to defection and increased cooperation serve as mechanisms to protect the common pool from overexploitation, which helps ensure a better long-term outcome for TfTAC.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfTAC(opponent_history, round, capacity, threshold=0.9, min_level=0.5):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round == r:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the last round
    else:
        if opponent_history[-1] == 'D':
            action = 'D'  # Defect when opponent defected last time
        elif total_consumption > threshold * capacity and opponent_history[-1] == 'C':
            action = 'D'  # Temporarily defect to help the common pool recover

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Variance (TFTV)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to show goodwill and set a cooperative baseline for opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, adopt the following decision rule:
     - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (reciprocity).
     - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (retaliation). To introduce variance and unpredictability, there's a small probability of deviating from this rule: with a probability p, cooperate even after an opponent's defection. This parameter p can be optimized to maximize long-term payoff based on the specific game parameters and opponents' behaviors.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing the current round's payoff as the game will end soon, so no need for punishing or rewarding opponents with a longer-term perspective. Cooperate if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, and defect otherwise.
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of the opponents' actions as explained earlier.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TFTV strategy seeks to exploit opponents by demonstrating cooperation initially but retaliating with defection when faced with repeated defections. The inclusion of a small probability of cooperating after an opponent's defection adds unpredictability, making it harder for opponents to predict the strategy and take advantage of it.
   - By reciprocating cooperation, TFTV aims to build trust and encourage long-term cooperation with less exploitative opponents while punishing those who repeatedly defect. This strategy encourages opponents to adopt a more cooperative approach over time if they want to maximize their payoffs.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This is a gesture of goodwill and allows the common pool to grow.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the average cooperation level of all opponents from the last T rounds (where T is an adjustable parameter, e.g., T=5). If the average cooperation level is above a certain threshold, cooperate; otherwise defect. The threshold is set based on the historical success rate of cooperation.
   - If the common pool stock falls below a specified minimum level (e.g., 2n), always defect to avoid further depletion.
   - If an opponent switches from cooperation to defection, wait for F delay rounds before retaliating with defection. This offers them a chance to change back to cooperative behavior.
   - After retaliation, revert to observing the average cooperation level and adjust the threshold accordingly based on the payoff from the previous round.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Cooperate if the average cooperation level is above the threshold; defect otherwise, as there are no more rounds for potential retaliation or recovery.
   - First round: Cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and allow the common pool to grow.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TfT-ACT primarily aims to mimic cooperation when opponents do so, but also punishes defection by retaliating with defection after a delay period. This strategy attempts to encourage long-term cooperation while minimizing excessive losses due to repeated defection from others.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, TFT-ACT compares the current stock level to a dynamically adjusted cooperation threshold. If the stock is above the threshold, the strategy cooperates; otherwise, it defects. The cooperation threshold adjusts based on the average consumption per round in recent history.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT-ACT(n, r, capacity, state, history):
    current_stock = state['stock']
    avg_consumption = average_consumption(history)
    cooperation_threshold = initial_threshold + (avg_consumption * multiplier)

    if current_stock > cooperation_threshold:
        action = 'C' # Cooperate
    else:
        action = 'D' # Defect

    return action
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the initial round, TFT-ACT cooperates since it has no history for calculating the cooperation threshold. In the last round, the strategy adopts a more conservative approach by raising the cooperation threshold to ensure higher stocks remain for future games.

Pseudocode:
```
function average_consumption(history):
    if len(history) == 1: # First round
        return initial_average_consumption

    total_consumption = sum(history['total_consumption'])
    return total_consumption / len(history)

function TFT-ACT(n, r, capacity, state, history):
    if round == 1: # First round
        action = 'C' # Cooperate
    elif round == r: # Last round
        average_consumption = average_consumption(history)
        cooperation_threshold = initial_threshold + (average_consumption * multiplier)
        if current_stock > cooperation_threshold:
            action = 'C' # Cooperate
        else:
            action = 'D' # Defect
    else:
        ... # Standard TFT-ACT logic from first question
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

TFT-ACT is an adaptive strategy that seeks to maximize its payoff while considering the actions of other players. It responds aggressively when opponents consume at higher rates, raising its cooperation threshold and defecting more frequently to maintain a higher stock level. Conversely, TFT-ACT cooperates more when opponents exhibit less aggressive behavior, increasing the common pool's stock for mutual benefit.

The multiplier adjusts the sensitivity of the cooperation threshold to the average consumption in recent history. A higher multiplier makes the strategy more responsive to opponent behavior, while a lower multiplier results in slower adaptation. By balancing this trade-off, TFT-ACT can adapt to various strategies employed by other players.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT-ACT(n, r, capacity, state, history):
    ... # As previously defined
    multiplier = aggressiveness_level

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to build a good reputation and demonstrate trustworthiness.
   - Subsequent rounds:
      - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate by cooperating as well.
      - If the opponent defected in the previous round, also defect in this round. However, if the difference between the current stock level and the capacity is less than a certain threshold (calculated based on average stock depletion per round), cooperate to help restore the common pool.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First round: Cooperate as mentioned above to establish trust and goodwill.
   - Last round: If the current stock level is sufficient for all players to have a payoff greater than or equal to an agreed minimum acceptable payoff (MAP), cooperate to maximize the overall benefit; otherwise, defect to ensure a minimal payoff.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - TFT-ACT is primarily designed for self-interest while considering long-term benefits over short-term gains. By initially cooperating and subsequently reciprocating cooperation, it aims to build a reputation that encourages opponents to cooperate more often, thereby maintaining a steady stock level and higher average payoffs. However, if an opponent repeatedly defects, TFT-ACT will also defect to minimize the depletion of the common pool and avoid being exploited.
   - Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (ACT) comes into play when the current stock level is close to the capacity. In this case, even if the opponent has defected in the previous round, TFT-ACT may choose to cooperate to help restore the common pool, as it recognizes that a well-maintained resource benefits all players in the long run.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Defection Threshold (TTFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TTFT starts by cooperating in the first round to foster a harmonious relationship. In subsequent rounds, it adapts its actions based on the opponent's history of cooperation or defection. The strategy maintains a Defection Threshold (DT) that determines when it will switch from cooperation to defection and vice versa.

   If DT = 0: Cooperate always
   If DT > s: Always defect
   Else: Cooperate if opponent cooperated in the last s rounds; otherwise, defect

   The Defection Threshold (DT) starts at a low value (e.g., DT = 1) and increases after being defeated (opponent defected) by a certain margin (e.g., +1) and decreases if the opponent cooperates (e.g., -1). The increase and decrease rates can be adjusted to fine-tune the strategy's aggressiveness.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TTFT always cooperates as mentioned earlier. For the last round, it does not need any special handling since the Defection Threshold will still be applied like in other rounds.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TTFT is an exploitative strategy because it initially cooperates to build a reputation and then adapts its behavior based on the opponent's actions. By defecting when necessary, it ensures that it receives better payoffs compared to pure cooperation strategies. However, it does not aim to harm the opponent unnecessarily but rather responds to the opponent's actions with fairness.

   In case of repeated interactions, TTFT can build long-term relationships with cooperative opponents while punishing defections from other players to maintain a good payoff level. This makes it a robust strategy against various opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TTFT(n, r, capacity, initial_stock):
    DT = 1                     # Defection Threshold
    previous_opponent_action = Cooperate   # Initialize with cooperation in the first round
    stock = initial_stock        # Current common pool stock

    for t in range(1, r+1):      # For each round
        opponent_action = ...     # Get opponent's action (cooperate or defect)

        if opponent_action == Cooperate:
            DT = max(DT - 1, 0)   # Reduce Defection Threshold if opponent cooperated
            payoff = stock / (2 * n)
        else:
            DT = min(DT + 1, n - 1)   # Increase Defection Threshold if opponent defected
            payoff = stock / n

        total_payoff += payoff       # Accumulate total payoff for the game

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (first round), play C to promote cooperation and show good faith.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior from previous rounds to decide whether to cooperate or defect:
     a) If the opponent has been cooperating, continue cooperating.
     b) If the opponent has been defecting, start defecting as well but with an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT).
       - Maintain CT at a high value in the early rounds to give the opponent a chance to switch back to cooperation.
       - As the game progresses, decrease CT gradually to exploit persistent defection. If the opponent continues to defect after reaching the minimum CT, start cooperating again to potentially rebuild trust.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Play according to the current strategy and past opponent behavior as in standard rounds.
   - First round (as mentioned earlier): Cooperate.
   - If the opponent has not made a move yet, copy their previous behavior if available or assume cooperation.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Initially show good faith by cooperating to encourage other players to do so as well, but be prepared to switch strategies quickly if they start defecting.
   - Gradually lower the cooperation threshold to take advantage of opponents who continue to defect. However, avoid being too exploitative by occasionally switching back to cooperation to rebuild trust and potentially regain mutual cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```python

      if current_round <= int(r * 0.2):  # Be patient in the early stages of the game
        strategy = "C"

    elif len(opponent_history) > current_round:  # If opponent has not made a move yet, use their last known behavior
      strategy = opponent_history[-current_round]

    # Perform the action and update the stock

      consumption = stock / (2n)

      consumption = stock / n

    stock -= consumption

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a friendly initial interaction (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's last action and respond accordingly:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C).
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) until they switch to cooperation. Once they do, return to cooperating (C).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the final round, defect (D), as the strategy focuses on maximizing payoffs over multiple rounds and cannot influence future interactions beyond this point.
   - There are no specific considerations for other edge cases since the core strategy remains unchanged, except that it is important to start cooperatively in the first round.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - Initially, cooperate to gain a higher payoff due to the generous reward structure but avoid overexploitation by quickly retaliating against defection with defecting actions until opponents switch back to cooperation. This approach allows the strategy to take advantage of opponents' initial generosity while punishing any defections.
   - The adaptive nature of this strategy means that it can adjust its behavior based on the opponent's moves, making it less predictable and more difficult for them to exploit.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFT_AC(opponent_history):
    my_history = [None] * len(opponent_history)  # initialize my history as None
    i = len(opponent_history) - 1  # start with the last round

    while i >= 0:
        if my_history[i] is None:  # first time encountering this opponent
            action = 'C'  # cooperate to establish a friendly initial interaction
            my_history[i] = action
        else:
            if opponent_history[i] == my_history[i]:  # opponent cooperated last round, cooperate too
                action = 'C'
            else:                                    # opponent defected last round, defect now
                action = 'D'
                while opponent_history[(i + 1) % len(opponent_history)] == 'D':  # continue defecting until they switch back to cooperation
                    i -= 1
        payoff[i] = calculate_payoff(action, stock[i])  # calculate payoff for this round
        stock[i - 1] = update_stock(stock[i], actions[i], n)  # update the common pool stock for next round

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always Cooperate to promote a cooperative environment and encourage others to cooperate as well. This is known as the "kindness" phase.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the actions of other players in the previous round. If they Cooperated, Cooperate in return. If they Defected, also Defect in response (Tit-for-Tat principle).
   - In case of a tie (more than half of the players Cooperated or Defected), the strategy should Cooperate to encourage continued cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT(player_index, round, n, history, capacity):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in first round
  else:
    num_cooperators = countCooperatorsInHistory(history)
    if num_cooperators > (n/2):
      action = 'C'  # Cooperate when majority cooperated previously
    elif num_cooperators <= (n/2):
      action = history[round - 1][player_index]  # Defect in response to opponent's previous action

  return action
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff by considering current stock level and the opponent's strategy over the past rounds. If the current stock is very low (close to zero), it may be best to Defect to secure as much resource as possible for the final payout.

Pseudocode:
```
function countCooperatorsInHistory(history):
  # Counts number of cooperative actions in history
  num_cooperators = 0
  for round in history:
    num_cooperators += countCooperatorsInRound(round)
  return num_cooperators

function countCooperatorsInRound(round):
  # Counts number of cooperative actions in a single round
  num_cooperators = 0
  for player in round:
    if player == 'C':
      num_cooperators += 1
  return num_cooperators
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - While this strategy is not strictly exploitative, it does respond to opponents' actions and can be seen as a mixed strategy that balances cooperation and defection based on past behavior. By mimicking others' actions, it may encourage short-term cooperation while taking advantage of any defectors in the long run.
   - If an opponent consistently Defects, this strategy will Defect in response, limiting its own losses while potentially causing the opponent to reconsider their strategy due to the lack of reciprocation. This can be seen as a form of indirect exploitation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_391 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Plus (TfT+)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) in the first round to foster a cooperative environment and build trust. This initial cooperation can induce others to reciprocate.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior from previous rounds to determine whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D). If the opponent has been cooperating, continue cooperating; if not, respond with the same action as the opponent in the previous round. This mimicry encourages opponents to stick to a single strategy and makes it difficult for them to gain an advantage.
   - In case of uncertainty about an opponent's past behavior or inconsistent actions, TfT+ will default to cooperating unless the current stock level is significantly depleted. Cooperate as long as the stock remains above (capacity/2n) - 10%. If the stock falls below this threshold, defect in order to help restore it and punish the opponent for overconsumption.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, TfT+ will cooperate if the current stock is above (capacity/2n) - 10%. This encourages opponents to conserve resources for the final round in order to maximize their payoff.
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, TfT+ will always cooperate to initiate cooperation.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - TfT+ maintains an exploitative mindset by using mimicry to encourage opponents to stick to a single strategy and then punishing them for overconsumption or defection. By defaulting to cooperating when the stock is not critically low, it ensures that the common pool resource does not get depleted too quickly, thereby maximizing its own long-term payoff.
   - However, it is important to note that TfT+ will not engage in "selfish" behavior like defecting consistently or always relying on others to cooperate while it defects. It maintains a balance between cooperation and defection, adapting its strategy based on the opponent's actions and the current state of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_Plus(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        if len(history) < r:
            action = 'C'  # Continue cooperating during the initial rounds if no past data available
        else:
            opponent_actions = history[-r]  # Get the last r actions of the opponent

                action = opponent_actions[-1]  # Mimic the opponent's last action

                else:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adjustment (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate to foster a cooperative environment.
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1):
      a. If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, cooperate.
      b. If any opponent defected in the previous round and stock is above 2n/3 * capacity, defect.
      c. If any opponent defected in the previous round and stock is below or equal to 2n/3 * capacity, cooperate to promote stock recovery.
      d. In the last round (t=r), prioritize a high payoff, so if any opponent has defected at least once before, defect regardless of the stock level.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFT_SA(opponents_actions, r, n, capacity):
  stocks = [capacity]
  strategy = []
  payoffs = []

  # First round
  strategy.append('C')

  for t in range(1, r+1):
    total_consumption = sum([stocks[t-1] // (2*n) for opponent in opponents if strategy[t-1][opponent] == 'D'] +
                             [stocks[t-1] // n for opponent in opponents if strategy[t-1][opponent] == 'C'])
    stocks.append(max(0, stocks[t-1] - total_consumption))
    stock_level = stocks[t]

    if all([strategy[t-1][opponent] == 'C' for opponent in opponents]):

    payoffs.append(stocks[t] / (2*n) if all([strategy[t][opponent] == 'C' for opponent in opponents]) else stocks[t] / n)

  return strategy, payoffs
```

2. Edge Cases:
   - The first round strategy ensures cooperation to establish a cooperative environment.
   - In the last round, TFT-SA will defect if any opponent has defected before, regardless of the stock level, to maximize payoff.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - By conditionally defecting when opponents have defected previously and the stock is above 2n/3 * capacity, TFT-SA can punish opponents who don't cooperate while maintaining cooperation when it is beneficial for both parties.
   - In cases where opponents consistently defect, TFT-SA will respond with defection to reduce stock levels and increase the chances of exhausting common resources, ultimately causing opponents lower payoffs over time.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), play C (Cooperate). This gesture is friendly and avoids immediate exploitation by opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, if opponent cooperated in the previous round, continue to cooperate. If the opponent defected, also defect in the current round. This rule encourages cooperation when it's reciprocated but punishes defection.
   - Modify the above rule for the last round (t=r) by playing C if the opponent cooperated in the previous round and r-1 rounds have passed, to ensure a higher payoff even at the end of the game.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - If the first round is skipped (t>1), mimic the opponent's behavior from the last seen round (i.e., if opponent played C in the last seen round, play C; otherwise, play D).
   - In case of discontinuity in the opponent's strategy (e.g., switching from C to D), TFTA maintains its current strategy for a grace period of 2r/3 rounds before adjusting to the new behavior. This grace period allows for minor errors or random fluctuations.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TFTA's exploitative nature is rooted in its retaliatory response to defection, which discourages opponents from defecting excessively as they risk being punished. However, when the opponent cooperates, TFTA rewards them with cooperation as well.

Pseudocode:
```python

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Adaptive (TFTA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   Initially, cooperate in the first round to foster a cooperative environment (C). After that, follow these rules for each subsequent round:
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back (C).
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (D). This is designed to punish defection and encourages cooperation.
   - In case of multiple opponents, apply this rule for each opponent independently.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First Round: Cooperate (C) to promote a cooperative environment initially.
   - Last Round: Since there are no future rounds to consider payoffs, act as if it was any other round and apply the TFTA rules above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The TFTA strategy aims to strike a balance between cooperation and punishing defection. It is designed to be cooperative by default but will retaliate when necessary, effectively acting as an exploitation mechanism for defectors.
   - By remembering previous actions, the strategy can adapt to opponent behavior over time, allowing it to be robust against a wide range of opponent strategies including simple or complex AI systems.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Greed (TfT-Greed) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to foster cooperation and allow the stock to grow initially.
   - From the second round onwards, evaluate the average consumption per round (ACPR) of all players so far.
   - If ACPR is below a predefined threshold (e.g., 1.05 * (2n)/r), continue cooperating to maintain stock growth and punish low contributors.
   - If ACPR exceeds the threshold, defect (D) to exploit overconsumption and gain higher payoffs.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if the stock allows it, play D for maximum payoff even if ACPR is below the threshold since there are no more rounds after this one.
   - If the current round's consumption leads to a negative or zero stock, play C in the following round to allow the stock to recover and potentially exploit other players later on.
   - In case of ties in ACPR calculation (due to floating point errors), prioritize cooperation as it benefits from the stock growth effect more than defection.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TfT-Greed is designed to be adaptive and exploitative, balancing between cooperation and defection based on the opponent's behavior. It punishes low contributors by cooperating and exploiting them when appropriate but also switches to defection if opponents become too aggressive with their consumption.

Pseudocode:

```
function TfT-Greed(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  strategy = "C"  # Initialize with cooperation
  ACPR = 0
  accumulated_consumption = 0

  if round == 1:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-with-Growth (TfTg)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and build trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round, but adjust actions based on accumulated stock depletion to prevent exhausting the common pool.

Pseudocode for decision rule:
```
function chooseAction(round, own_history, opponent_history, parameters) {
  if (round == 1) {
    return "C" // Cooperate in first round
  }

  previous_own_action = own_history[round - 1]
  previous_opponent_action = opponent_history[round - 1]

  if (previous_own_action == "C" && previous_opponent_action == "C") {
    if (stock >= capacity * 0.8) { // If stock is not critically low, cooperate
      return "C"
    } else { // Otherwise, defect to prevent exhaustion of the common pool
      return "D"
    }
  }

  if (previous_own_action == "C" && previous_opponent_action == "D") { // If opponent defected and you cooperated, defect this round to punish them
    return "D"
  }

  if (previous_own_action == "D" && previous_opponent_action == "C") { // If opponent cooperated and you defected, cooperate this round to demonstrate goodwill again

  if (previous_own_action == "D" && previous_opponent_action == "D") { // If both players defected, mimic the opponent's action from the last round
    return opponent_history[round - 1]
  }
}
```

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if the common pool is about to be depleted or close to extinction, defect to minimize loss and prevent further damage to the resource.

Pseudocode for edge case handling:
```
function handle_last_round(own_history, opponent_history, parameters) {
  if (stock < capacity * 0.2 || round == r) { // If stock is critically low or it's the last round, defect to minimize loss
    return "D"
  } else {
    return chooseAction(round, own_history, opponent_history, parameters)
  }
}
```

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The TfTg strategy is designed to be exploitative by punishing defection with defection and rewarding cooperation with cooperative behavior in most cases, while taking into account the current stock level to prevent exhaustion of the common pool. This strategy encourages opponents to maintain cooperative behavior, but also provides a strong punishment for defection.
   - The strategy is also adaptive as it adjusts its actions based on the accumulated stock depletion from previous rounds and the current state of the common pool.
   - In contrast to the original Tit-for-Tat strategy, TfTg includes a growth factor that helps prevent the exhaustion of the common pool over time, making it more robust in long-term games with limited resources.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

   In each round, TFT-ACT decides to cooperate or defect based on the opponent's history of actions and the current stock level. The strategy follows a Tit-for-Tat approach, initially cooperating and retaliating against defection with a delayed response. To be more adaptive and avoid over-punishment, TFT-ACT introduces an adjustable cooperation threshold (CT) that determines when it is optimal to cooperate despite previous defections by the opponent.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function TFT_ACT(opponentHistory, roundNumber, stock, capacity, CT):
       if roundNumber == 1:
           return Cooperate

       if len(opponentHistory) < roundNumber - 1:
           return opponentHistory[-1]   # copy last action of the opponent

       if stock <= (capacity / (2n)) and opponentHistory[-roundNumber + 1] == Defect:
           if opponentHistory[-roundNumber + 1] != opponentHistory[-1]:
               updateCT(opponentHistory, CT)   # adjust cooperation threshold based on opponent's behavior

       return Cooperate if stock <= (capacity / (2n)) * CT and opponentHistory[-1] == Cooperate
           or Defect otherwise
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

   In the first round, TFT-ACT cooperates regardless of the opponent's history since there is no previous information available. In the last round, it behaves like a regular Tit-for-Tat strategy by mirroring the opponent's actions from the previous round.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

   TFT-ACT is designed to be exploitative by taking advantage of opponents that are prone to cooperate and then defecting, thus maximizing its payoff over time while minimizing potential stock depletion due to repeated defections. However, it also has a built-in mechanism for adaptability to counter opponents that are more aggressive or unpredictable, as indicated by adjustments in the cooperation threshold (CT). This allows TFT-ACT to maintain a balance between exploitation and cooperation without being overly punitive towards less cooperative opponents.

   The updateCT function could be implemented using several strategies, such as increasing CT when an opponent cooperates after defecting or decreasing it if they repeatedly cooperate. These variations can help make TFT-ACT more adaptive to a wider range of opponent behaviors.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_398 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Start by Cooperating to build trust and goodwill, setting the cooperation threshold for the first round to be equal to the capacity/n (i.e., the maximum sustainable stock level per player). If any opponent defects in the initial round, set the current round's cooperation threshold as the previous round's total consumption level.
   - Subsequent Rounds: Evaluate whether to Cooperate or Defect based on the following decision rule:
     a) If the total consumption in the previous round is less than or equal to the current round's cooperation threshold, Cooperate.
     b) If the total consumption in the previous round exceeds the current round's cooperation threshold, Defect.
   - Adaptive Cooperation Threshold: After each round, update the cooperation threshold as follows:
      1) If all players cooperated during the current round, set the new cooperation threshold to the minimum of the previous cooperation threshold and the total consumption in the current round (to promote further cooperation).
      2) If any player defected during the current round, set the new cooperation threshold to the total consumption in the current round (to penalize defection).
   - Last Round: In the last round, always Cooperate since there are no subsequent rounds to retaliate.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If the game is played for a single round (r=1), follow the initial-round rule and cooperate if all opponents also choose cooperation.
   - If the capacity is less than 2n, adjust it to the closest multiple of 2n.
   - If n or r are less than 2, adjust them to their nearest multiples of 2 to maintain a balanced game structure.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TfT-ACT seeks to exploit opponents by promoting cooperation when they cooperate and punishing defection with increased punishment over time. This allows the strategy to build trust during periods of mutual cooperation, but also encourages other players to defect less frequently due to the escalating consequences of doing so.
   - The adaptation mechanism in TfT-ACT makes it flexible and robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors, allowing it to respond effectively to both cooperative and exploitative strategies.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFTAT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, evaluate the cooperation ratio (CR), which is the average number of players cooperating in the last 'k' rounds. If CR > threshold, cooperate; otherwise, defect. The threshold value is a function of the average number of cooperators over the entire game so far. This encourages cooperation when most players have been cooperative recently but switches to defection if players have been mainly uncooperative.

Pseudocode:
```
def evaluateCR(last_k_rounds):
  total_coop = sum(players[i].action == 'C' for i in last_k_rounds)
  return total_coop / k

def getThreshold():
  total_coop = sum(player.totalCooperationOverGame / r for player in players)
  return (total_coop / n) + delta

def decideAction(state, history):
  last_k_rounds = history[-k:]
  CR = evaluateCR(last_k_rounds)
  threshold = getThreshold()
  if CR > threshold:
    return 'C' (Cooperate)
  else:
    return 'D' (Defect)
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, the agent does not have a history of cooperative behavior from others to base its decision on. In this case, it will choose an action randomly with equal probability (0.5) between cooperation and defection.

Pseudocode:
```
def decideAction(state, history):
  if len(history) == 0:
    return 'C' or 'D' # random selection
  ...
```

In the last round, the agent should consider that the game will not be repeated and prioritize its own payoff. If it has cooperated extensively throughout the game but others have defected in the last few rounds, it may decide to switch strategies and defect to receive a higher payout in the final round.

Pseudocode:
```
def decideAction(state, history):
  if len(history) == r-1:
    CR = evaluateCR(history[-k:])
    threshold = getThreshold()
    if CR < threshold and state.stock > 0: # Ensures there is stock remaining to be taken
      return 'D'
    else:
      return 'C'
  ...
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

TFTAT is designed to mimic the tit-for-tat strategy, which is known for its cooperative nature but includes an adaptation mechanism that retaliates against defection by defecting back in subsequent rounds. However, this strategy includes a higher cooperation threshold to encourage cooperation when most players have been cooperative recently. This makes it less susceptible to exploitation from uncooperative opponents as it will not continue cooperating if the majority of players are not doing so. When faced with continuous defection, the agent will switch to defection and potentially damage the payoff of the other players in the long run.

In each round, the ATFT strategy starts by cooperating to build trust and maintain a healthy stock level. If an opponent cooperates in response, ATFT continues to cooperate. However, if an opponent ever defects, ATFT will also defect for one round as a punishment for the defection (Tit-for-Tat). After that single act of retaliation, ATFT returns to cooperating unless the opponent defects again. This simple response strategy encourages cooperation while also punishing defections effectively.

Pseudocode:
```
def play_round(opponent_action):
  if first_round:
    return "C" (Cooperate)
  elif previous_round_cooperation and opponent_action == "C":
    return "C"
  elif previous_round_cooperation and opponent_action == "D":
    return "D"
  elif opponent_action == "D":
    return "D"
  else:
    return "C"
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, ATFT cooperates to set a cooperative tone. In the last round, it may be advantageous to defect if there is a significant stock level difference between players since the game does not have any payoffs carried over between rounds. However, for simplicity and to encourage more cooperation in general, ATFT will continue to cooperate in the final round as well.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

ATFT is designed to be initially cooperative and gradually adaptive to opponent behavior while being responsive to changes in the common pool resource. The strategy encourages cooperation among players but also punishes defections effectively, aligning it with an exploitative approach by taking advantage of opponents who do not cooperate or defect strategically. It maintains a balance between cooperation and competition, making it difficult for other strategies to predict its actions while still promoting mutual cooperation when possible.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFTAT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, analyze the history of opponent's actions and compare it against a cooperative threshold (CT). If the ratio of cooperation to total actions by the opponent exceeds CT during the previous t rounds, respond with cooperation; otherwise, defect. The CT is calculated as follows:

   - Initialize CT = 1/2 (initially assume equal cooperation)
   - Adjust CT after every round based on opponent's behavior:
     If opponent cooperates in a round, increase CT by a small increment (e.g., 0.01).
     If opponent defects in a round, decrease CT by a smaller increment (e.g., 0.005) to account for slight deviations from cooperation.
     However, never let CT go below the initial value of 1/2 or exceed the maximum value of 1.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFTAT(opponent_history):
    current_ct = 0.5
    for action in opponent_history[-t:]:
        if action == 'C':
            current_ct += increment
        else:
            current_ct -= decrement
        # Ensure CT is between [0.5, 1]
        if current_ct < 0.5:
            current_ct = 0.5
        elif current_ct > 1.0:
            current_ct = 1.0
    return 'C' if current_ct >= CT else 'D'
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the initial round, since there is no history to analyze, cooperate as a default strategy (assuming some level of cooperation among players). In the last round, consider the current CT and opponent's behavior to make a decision.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   By adapting CT based on the opponent's cooperation ratio in recent rounds, the TFTAT strategy maintains a balance between cooperation and defection while being responsive to changes in opponent behavior. The aim is to punish defectors (who do not cooperate enough) and reward cooperators (who demonstrate consistent cooperation). This strategy can be considered exploitative as it takes advantage of opponents who deviate from cooperative behavior, while still benefiting from cooperative opponents when possible.

In summary, the TFTAT strategy is adaptive, robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors, and aligns with the game's requirements and the defined objectives. The pseudocode provides a high-level description of the decision rules for implementing this strategy in an algorithmic format.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to help build trust and show goodwill towards other players. This initial cooperation may encourage others to reciprocate in subsequent rounds.

   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior from the previous round:
     a. If the opponent cooperated (C), continue cooperating to reinforce mutual trust.
     b. If the opponent defected (D), also defect in the current round to punish the opponent for depleting the common pool resource. This punishment is intended to encourage them to adjust their behavior in future rounds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, follow the initial cooperate rule as described above.
   - In the last round, regardless of the opponent's previous actions, cooperate to leave a positive impression and potentially foster future collaborations.
   - If there are no distinct "last" rounds, maintain the adaptive decision rules for each round.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy initially appears cooperative but swiftly punishes defection by reciprocating in kind. This approach can deter opponents from continuously defecting, as they will experience reduced rewards over time due to the depleted common pool resource.
   - By adapting its behavior based on the opponent's actions, the strategy is designed to exploit any indication of cooperative intentions while remaining responsive to defection and punishing it accordingly. This adaptability helps ensure that the strategy maintains a strong position in various scenarios against a wide range of opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode for Tit-for-Tat Strategy:
```
function TitForTat(round, opponent_action, round_history):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round == r:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the last round
    else:
        previous_opponent_action = round_history[round - 1]
        if opponent_action == "C" and previous_opponent_action == "D":
            return "D"  # Punish opponent for defection
        elif opponent_action == "D" and previous_opponent_action == "C":
            return "D"  # Punish opponent for defection
        else:  # Opponent either cooperated or continued the same action as the previous round
            return "C"  # Cooperate to reinforce trust or maintain a positive relationship

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TACT) Strategy

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initiate with cooperation (C) in the first round to build a collaborative atmosphere and avoid immediate punishment.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the average historical cooperation level of opponents and compare it against the current adaptive cooperation threshold (T_ct).
     If the opponents' average cooperation is greater than T_ct, cooperate; otherwise, defect.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of opponent behavior to maximize potential payoff in that particular round.
   - For the initial round, cooperate to foster a collaborative environment.
   - If the opponents fail to cooperate for multiple rounds, gradually increase T_ct to reduce the likelihood of continued cooperation with non-cooperating players.
     Conversely, if opponents start cooperating after a long streak of defection, lower T_ct to encourage further collaboration.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Start by being overly generous, cooperating in the first round to create an illusion of trustworthiness.
   - Adapt cooperation based on opponent behavior to maximize short-term gains while maintaining a reasonable long-term payoff.
   - Gradually increase T_ct to punish opponents who take advantage of initial generosity, and lower it when opponents begin cooperating.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tit_for_tat_with_adaptive_threshold(n, r, capacity, history):
    current_round = len(history) + 1
    cooperation_level = sum([0 if opponent['action'] == 'D' else 1 for opponent in history]) / current_round
    cooperation_threshold = max(min(cooperation_level * 0.8, 1), min(cooperation_level * 0.2, 0)) # adjust sensitivity by changing the multiplier

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (initial friendly gesture).
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's cooperative history and make decisions accordingly.
   - Maintain a running total of past cooperative actions by the opponent (cumulative_cooperation).
   - If cumulative_cooperation >= cooperation_threshold, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - Update cooperation_threshold dynamically based on the current round and overall game progress:
     - Cooperation_threshold starts at a low value in the first few rounds to encourage cooperation.
     - Cooperation_threshold increases linearly towards capacity/n as the game progresses to make it harder for opponents to exploit.
   - If the game reaches its final round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's history (friendly gesture before exiting the game).

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_ACT(round, cumulative_cooperation, cooperation_threshold, capacity, n):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C'

  if round == r:
    return 'C' # Friendly gesture before exiting the game

def update_cooperation_threshold(current_round, capacity, n):
  cooperation_threshold = min(capacity / n * (current_round / r), capacity / n)
  return cooperation_threshold
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TfT-ACT cooperates as a friendly gesture.
   - If an opponent defects in the first few rounds, TfT-ACT will respond by defecting until their cooperative history improves or the game ends.
   - As the game progresses and cooperation_threshold increases, it becomes more challenging for opponents to exploit TfT-ACT.
   - In the final round, regardless of the opponent's past actions, TfT-ACT will cooperate as a friendly gesture before exiting the game.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The adaptive cooperation threshold increases over time, making it more difficult for opponents to exploit TfT-ACT by repeatedly defecting.
   - However, TfT-ACT is not designed to punish opponents excessively, as it continues cooperating even when the opponent defects in subsequent rounds.
   - By maintaining a history of past cooperative actions and adapting its cooperation threshold based on game progress, TfT-ACT encourages opponents to cooperate while remaining resilient against exploitation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Greed (TfT-AG)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   a) In the first round, cooperate to create a cooperative atmosphere and establish trust. This sets a baseline for future interactions.
   b) For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from the previous round:
       i) If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, return the favor by cooperating in the current round.
       ii) If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to punish the opponent for their selfish behavior. This discourages continuous exploitation and encourages future cooperation.
   c) Maintain this pattern of responding to the opponent's actions throughout the game.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   a) In the first round, cooperate as described above.
   b) In the last round, cooperate if the opponent has been cooperative in recent rounds to end on a positive note and potentially encourage future cooperation. Otherwise, defect to punish the opponent for past transgressions.
   c) For intermediate rounds, use the decision rule mentioned under point 1 to adapt to the opponent's behavior.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   a) Initially cooperate to establish trust, but do not hesitate to punish opponents who continuously defect by defecting in response. This strategy ensures that opponents who continuously exploit are met with punishment.
   b) By adapting to the opponent's behavior, the TfT-AG strategy seeks to exploit opponents who switch between cooperative and exploitative actions. In this way, it takes an opportunistic approach to maximize its own payoff while minimizing potential losses from continuous exploitation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and encourage others to do so as well.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the average cooperation level of other players (C_avg) in the last t rounds (t = 3 or 4). If C_avg > 50%, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This rule rewards cooperative players and punishes uncooperative ones while still allowing for occasional defections to prevent being taken advantage of.
   - Adaptively adjust the cooperation threshold based on long-term success:
     a) If the average payoff over the past 10 rounds is higher when cooperating than defecting, increase the cooperation threshold by 5%.
     b) If the average payoff over the past 10 rounds is lower when cooperating than defecting, decrease the cooperation threshold by 5%.
     c) If the threshold reaches a minimum of 20% or maximum of 80%, maintain the current threshold.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if cooperation with the opponent during previous rounds resulted in higher payoffs than defection; otherwise, defect to secure better rewards in case the opponent changes strategy.
   - If the stock becomes depleted (0), the game is over, and no further actions are taken. The player should learn from the game experience to inform future strategies.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT follows an exploitative approach by taking advantage of uncooperative opponents while still maintaining a cooperative stance to encourage cooperation in others. It rewards consistent cooperation and punishes defection with strategic retaliation, fostering a balance between cooperation and self-interest.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G) Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially in the first round, cooperate to contribute towards stock growth (C). This helps conserve resources and encourages cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - In all other rounds, evaluate the average consumption per player (ACP) since the last time the common pool was at or below 50% of its capacity. If ACP > 1.25 (average resource exploitation rate), defect (D) to punish over-exploiters and reduce their future incentive to deplete resources excessively.
   - If ACP ≤ 1.25, cooperate (C) to maintain a stable resource level and encourage cooperation among opponents.
   - In the last round, defect (D), as there will be no opportunity for reciprocity or further growth of the common pool.

Pseudocode:
```
function TfT-G(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, history) {
  rounds_played = 0
  average_consumption_per_player = 0

  if (rounds_played == 1) return 'C'  // First round cooperation

  for (i in history) {
    consumption_in_round = sum(history[i]['consumption'])
    average_consumption_per_player += consumption_in_round / n
  }
  average_consumption_per_player /= rounds_played - 1

  if (initial_stock <= capacity/2 && average_consumption_per_player > 1.25) return 'D'  // Punish over-exploiters
  else if (average_consumption_per_player <= 1.25) return 'C'               // Cooperate with moderate exploiters

  if (rounds_played == r) return 'D'   // Defect in the last round
  else rounds_played += 1              // Increment rounds played for future decisions
}
```

This Tit-for-Tat-Growth strategy is exploitative as it encourages cooperation at first and punishes excessive resource depletion. However, it also maintains a balance by not being too lenient with over-exploiters and defecting in the final round to ensure its own payoff maximization. The strategy is adaptive and robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors as it adjusts its cooperation or defection decision based on the average consumption rate observed in previous rounds.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_408 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, the TFTSA strategy follows these decision rules based on the current state (stock) and history of actions from previous rounds:

- If the stock level is below a predefined threshold (S_threshold), always defect (D). This ensures that the strategy doesn't contribute to further depleting the common pool when resources are scarce.
  - Pseudocode: If stock < S_threshold, then play D

- If the stock level is above or equal to the predefined threshold and the player has always cooperated in previous rounds (Trust), continue cooperating (C). This builds trust with other players by demonstrating cooperation.
  - Pseudocode: If player i has always cooperated before and stock >= S_threshold, then play C

- If the player has ever defected in previous rounds (Betrayal) or the current state is the first round, cooperate only if the stock level is significantly above the threshold (Generosity). This allows for some forgiveness when others have previously betrayed the trust and encourages cooperation when resources are plentiful.
  - Pseudocode: If player i has defected before or it's the first round, then play C if stock > S_generosity_threshold

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

- In the first round, players don't have a history of actions to consider, so the Generosity condition is checked instead: cooperate only if the stock level is significantly above the threshold (Generosity).
  - Pseudocode: If it's the first round, then play C if stock > S_generosity_threshold

- In the last round, players can no longer affect the growth of the common pool, so they should prioritize their own payoff. In this case, always defect (D) to maximize personal reward when resources are abundant or scarce.
  - Pseudocode: If it's the last round, then play D

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

- By combining a Tit-for-Tat approach with stock considerations, TFTSA is designed to initially cooperate and build trust, but also respond harshly when betrayed or when resources become scarce. This allows for the extraction of more resources from other players while still maintaining some level of cooperation that can benefit the common pool in the long run.
- However, since TFTSA prioritizes its own payoff in the last round, it may be considered slightly less exploitative than pure self-interest strategies when resource levels are high or stable.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_409 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In every round, compare the current stock level to a dynamic cooperation threshold (CT). If the current stock is greater than or equal to CT, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - Initially set CT to capacity/n (the maximum sustainable stock per player), and adjust it based on the opponent's actions during previous rounds.
   - In each round where you have cooperated and the opponent has also cooperated, increase CT by a small increment. If you have cooperated but the opponent has defected, maintain the same CT. If you have defected and the opponent has cooperated, decrease CT by a larger decrement. This encourages cooperation when the opponent is cooperative but gradually lowers trust if they betray the cooperation.
   - In the event that the current stock falls below the CT, reset CT to capacity/n for the next round to account for resource depletion and incentivize recovery of the common pool.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First Round: Set CT to capacity/n (maximum sustainable stock per player) and cooperate since there is no history yet.
   - Last Round: Evaluate the current state like any other round, with adjustments in CT based on previous opponent actions.
   - Special Cases: If the stock level drops below 0 after consumption, set it to 0 for subsequent rounds.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-ACT strategy maintains a balance between cooperation and defection, adapting to the opponent's behavior to maximize long-term payoffs while also retaliating when betrayed. By gradually increasing CT when the opponent cooperates and decreasing it when they defect, the strategy exploits their cooperation while encouraging them to maintain collaborative efforts for mutual benefit.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Greed Strategy (TfttG) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TfttG will start by cooperating in the first round to build a cooperative reputation and encourage others to cooperate, as this can lead to higher long-term payoffs. After the initial round, the strategy will respond to the opponent's actions in the previous round:
   - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, TfttG cooperates.
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, TfttG defects. This is an exploitative response aimed at punishing the opponent for their previous defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TfttG cooperates to establish a positive reputation. In the last round, TfttG will defect regardless of the opponent's action in the previous round, since there are no future rounds for retaliation or rewarding cooperation.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TfttG is designed to exploit opponents by adopting a punitive response to defection while being cooperative when faced with cooperation. This strategy aims to encourage others to cooperate, but it will also swiftly retaliate against defection to maximize payoffs in the short term and maintain long-term sustainability of the common pool resource.

Pseudocode:

```python

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a positive relationship and maintain hope for cooperation in future rounds. (C)
   - For subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate. (C)
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect as retaliation but with a twist: if this results in the stock falling below a critical level, switch to cooperating to aid in stock recovery. (D if S > Critical_stock, otherwise C)
   - In the last round, when payoffs are solely based on the current state, cooperate if doing so helps maximize the final payoff (C if S > (2n*r)/(r+1), otherwise D)

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If the opponent does not cooperate in the first round, TfTSA will start retaliating immediately. However, it will still switch to cooperative behavior once the stock falls below a critical level (defined as Critical_stock = capacity/4).

3. Be exploitative:
   - TfTSA is designed to be both exploitative and adaptive. By initially cooperating and retaliating only when necessary, it hopes to discourage opponents from defecting repeatedly without fear of losing future opportunities for cooperation. However, the stock adaptation rule allows TfTSA to recover the common pool resource quickly when its depletion becomes detrimental to its long-term interests.

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_412 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Generosity (TfT-AG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly opening gesture to encourage cooperation and avoid immediate exploitation.
   - If an opponent cooperates in a given round, cooperate (C) in the next round. This mimics reciprocity and encourages cooperation.
   - If an opponent defects (D) in a given round, defect (D) in the next round. This is a punishment for defection and may encourage future cooperation.
   - To show generosity and foster long-term cooperation, there's a chance to cooperate even after an opponent has defected. The probability of cooperating decreases as more opponents have defected.
     - Initialize a "defection counter" D_counter for each opponent, starting at 0 (no defections yet).
     - After each round where an opponent defects, increment D_counter by 1.
     - When deciding whether to cooperate or defect in the next round, use the following rule:
       - If D_counter < threshold (e.g., threshold = 3), there's a chance to cooperate with probability of (4 - D_counter)/4.
       - If D_counter ≥ threshold, always defect. This means after three defections in a row, the AI will no longer be generous and will always defect back.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if an opponent has not yet defected, cooperate to encourage cooperation even at the end of the game. If an opponent has already defected, there's no need for additional punishment as the game is ending anyway.
   - In case of a tie (all opponents are either always cooperating or always defecting), follow the same rules as mentioned above to foster long-term cooperation.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The strategy will initially cooperate, which can lead opponents to exploit it, but it also encourages reciprocity by rewarding cooperation.
   - The adaptive generosity mechanism provides a balance between exploitation and cooperation. By punishing defection, the AI is able to deter short-term exploitation while still promoting long-term cooperation.
   - The probability of cooperating after an opponent has defected decreases over time, providing an opportunity for opponents to rebuild trust but also ensuring that the AI doesn't continue to be overly generous indefinitely.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFTAT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round, TFTAT starts by cooperating unless the current stock level is below a defined threshold (T). If the current stock level is at or above T, TFTAT cooperates; otherwise, it defects. The cooperation threshold T is determined adaptively based on the player's past experiences with other players. Initially, T = capacity / 2n.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   if current_stock >= T:
       action = "Cooperate"
   else:
       action = "Defect"
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
In the first round, TFTAT sets T to capacity / 2n because it has no prior information about other players' strategies. In subsequent rounds, T is updated based on the previous round's outcome. If the game reaches the last round (r), TFTAT cooperates regardless of the current stock level since there are no further rounds to consider.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
TFTAT's adaptive cooperation threshold makes it exploitative by prioritizing self-interest while maintaining a cooperative stance most of the time. TFTAT punishes defection from other players by lowering its own cooperation level (i.e., decreasing T) but rewards cooperative behavior by increasing T slightly. This encourages other players to cooperate more frequently, which can benefit both parties in the long run.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   if previous_round_outcome was a defection:
       update T by decreasing it slightly
   elif previous_round_outcome was a cooperation:
       update T by increasing it slightly
   ```

   Note that the exact formulas for updating T need to be carefully chosen to balance exploitation and cooperation effectively. A possible approach could be based on linear interpolation, where T is adjusted by subtracting or adding a fraction of capacity/2n depending on the previous round's outcome.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and encourage reciprocity.
   - For subsequent rounds, adopt a Tit-for-Tat approach: if an opponent cooperates in a round, cooperate in the next round; if an opponent defects, also defect in the next round.
   - Implement an Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (ACT) to account for changes in average opponent behavior and stock level depletion over time:
     - If the average number of cooperators in the last M rounds is above a certain threshold (T), cooperate; otherwise, defect. The value of T can be adjusted based on the specific game parameters and historical data.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as described earlier.
   - If the current round is the last round, act based on the average number of cooperators in the recent past (M rounds). If this average is above T, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - If there are not enough historical data for M rounds due to a short game duration or a sudden change in opponents, use an initial average to determine the first action and adjust it adaptively based on the observed cooperation from subsequent rounds.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By following Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT), the strategy aims to maintain a balance between cooperation and defection, exploiting opponents that are prone to defect while still encouraging cooperation from cooperative opponents. The adaptive cooperation threshold ensures robustness against various opponent behaviors and dynamic game conditions.
   - To maximize payoff, TfT-ACT continuously adapts its cooperation behavior based on the average number of cooperators in the recent past, effectively exploiting opponents who consistently defect while maintaining a level of cooperation with those prone to cooperate.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - TfTA starts by cooperating in the first round, mirroring the initial trusting nature of the game.
   - In subsequent rounds, TfTA copies the opponent's action from the previous round (cooperation or defection). This strategy maintains cooperation as long as the opponent does so, but retaliates with defection if the opponent defected in the previous round.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, TfTA continues to mirror the opponent's action from the second-to-last round, since the game is over after that.
   - If the opponent defects in the first round (a sign of uncooperative behavior), TfTA will also defect for the remainder of the game as a punishment and to protect its own interests.

3. Exploitative Aspect:
   - TfTA is exploitative by retaliating against uncooperative opponents, ensuring that it does not suffer from excessive stock depletion due to repeated defection.
   - However, TfTA also rewards cooperative opponents with cooperation in return, promoting the potential for mutual gain when both players exhibit cooperative behavior.

Pseudocode:
```
function TitForTatAdaptive(opponent_action_history, round):
  if round == 1:
    return Cooperate()

  if opponent_action_history[-1] == Cooperate():
    return Cooperate()
  else:
    return Defect()

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Greed (TFT-AG)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, TFT-AG starts by cooperating if the total consumption in the previous round was below a certain threshold (represented as P). If the total consumption exceeded the threshold, TFT-AG will defect in the current round. The threshold value P is initially set to half of the maximum sustainable stock level (capacity / 2) but will adapt dynamically based on the opponent's behavior.

If the opponent consistently cooperates, lowering the P threshold over time to encourage more cooperation. Conversely, if the opponent frequently defects, raising the P threshold to discourage defection and promote cooperation. The change in the P threshold should be gradual to allow for adaptability.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT_AG(history):
    previous_total_consumption = sum(consumptions in history[-r:])
    if previous_total_consumption < P:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        return Defect

function update_P(history, learning_rate):
    if opponent cooperated in the last round:
        new_P = min(P + learning_rate, capacity / 2)
    elif opponent defected in the last round:
        new_P = max(P - learning_rate, 0)
    P = new_P
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the initial rounds (up to a certain number represented as R), TFT-AG will cooperate to encourage cooperation from opponents and build trust. After R rounds, it starts applying the decision rule based on the updated P threshold. In the final round, since there are no subsequent rounds, TFT-AG ignores the P threshold and chooses an action to maximize its payoff in that specific situation.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT_AG(history):
    if len(history) < R:
        return Cooperate
    else:
        decision = TFT_AG(history)
        if len(history) == r:
            # Maximize payoff in the last round
            return action that maximizes payoff with current state
        else:
            return decision
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

TFT-AG aims to extract maximum benefits while maintaining some level of cooperation, but it will take advantage of opponents who consistently defect by increasing the P threshold and defecting more often. This strategy encourages opponents to cooperate in the initial rounds, but if they do not reciprocate, TFT-AG will defect more frequently to punish them and increase its payoff. The learning rate determines how aggressively TFT-AG responds to opponent behavior, allowing for adaptation to various opponent strategies.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFTC) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Start with cooperation in the first round (cooperative initiation).
   - In subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, continue to cooperate. If the opponent defected, also defect in the current round (retaliation).
   - Introduce an adaptive cooperation threshold based on the average historical cooperation rate of the opponent. If the opponent's cooperation rate exceeds the threshold, switch to cooperation; otherwise, defect.
     - Calculate the average historical cooperation rate as the total number of previous cooperative actions divided by the total number of rounds so far.
     - Set an initial cooperation threshold at a moderate value (e.g., 50%). Adjust the threshold after every round based on the opponent's behavior, moving it slightly closer to the current average historical cooperation rate if the opponent's rate deviates significantly from the threshold.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action (final goodwill).
   - If the opponent defected in the first round and there is no previous history (e.g., first interaction), defect.
   - If the opponent stopped cooperating after a period of cooperation, increase the cooperation threshold slightly to account for their changed behavior.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Pretend to cooperate initially to build trust but quickly retaliate against opponents who exploit that trust by defecting.
   - Adjust cooperation threshold based on the opponent's historical cooperation rate to maintain an advantage over short-term defectors and long-term cooperators alike.

Pseudocode:
```
TFTC(n, r, capacity, stock, history) {
  rounds_so_far = current_round + 1

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Management (ATFM)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate (C) when the current stock is above a certain threshold (StockThreshold) and the difference between the initial capacity and the total consumption so far is greater than or equal to a predefined tolerance value (Tolerance). This encourages cooperation when resources are abundant and ensures that the common pool doesn't deplete too quickly.
   - Defect (D) otherwise. When resources are scarce, it's more beneficial to take a larger share in anticipation of future cooperation from other players.

Pseudocode:
```python
function ATFM(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, StockThreshold=0.8, Tolerance=50):
    total_consumption = 0
    stock = initial_stock

    for round in range(1, r+1):
        if stock <= 0:
            return D

        consumption = D if (stock / capacity - total_consumption / capacity) < Tolerance else C
        total_consumption += consumption
        stock -= total_consumption

        growth = 2 * stock * (1 - stock / capacity)
        new_stock = min(capacity, stock + growth)
        stock = new_stock
    return None
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperation is initiated to build trust and conserve resources for future rounds.
   - Last Round: The strategy continues cooperating if the current stock exceeds the StockThreshold, otherwise it defects to maximize its payoff in the final round.

3. Be Exploitative: ATFM aims to exploit opponent's inconsistent or non-cooperative behavior by adapting to their actions and conserving resources when opponents are cooperating, but taking a larger share when opponents are not. The strategy maintains a balance between cooperation and self-interest while ensuring the common pool doesn't deplete too quickly. By doing so, ATFM encourages other players to cooperate in the long term, but is able to adapt and defect when necessary.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (with a twist)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peaceful initiation, promoting cooperation for potential partners while not rewarding defectors.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's strategy from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate; otherwise, defect. This rule encourages cooperation when reciprocated but punishes defection with defection, fostering a reputation for fairness and retaliation.
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous move to maximize potential payoff.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tit_for_tat(round, history):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C' # Cooperate in the first round
  elif history[-1] == 'C':
    return 'C' # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
  else:
    return 'D' # Defect if opponent defected last round

def last_round(r, round):
  return round == r
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the second round, the strategy will either continue cooperating (if the first player also cooperated in the first round) or defect (if the first player defected).
   - If the game lasts for only two rounds, the strategy will act as described above and return a single move.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy is designed to be cooperative when reciprocated but punishes defection with defection. This encourages cooperation while also penalizing selfish behavior, aligning with an exploitative mindset by taking advantage of opponents who defect without considering the consequences for future interactions.
   - However, it's essential to note that the strategy does not always maximize immediate payoffs, as it prioritizes building a reputation for fairness and punishing defection over short-term gains. This long-term perspective makes the strategy robust and adaptive against various opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness (TfTf)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, start by cooperating (C). This is a peace offering to potential partners and allows for stock growth.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze opponents' actions from the previous round:
     - If opponent cooperated in the last round, reciprocate with cooperation (C). This reinforces trust and encourages long-term partnerships.
     - If opponent defected in the last round, defect (D) in the current round as a punishment. However, implement forgiveness by returning to cooperation if the opponent cooperates in the following two rounds. Forgiveness is crucial for maintaining relationships and fostering cooperation over time.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, defect (D), regardless of the opponent's previous action, as there are no further opportunities for interaction or payback.
   - If the stock drops to zero during a game, reset the stock to the initial capacity and continue playing the game with the same strategy. This keeps the game running despite temporary depletion of resources.
   - In case of multiple opponents, maintain individual decision rules for each opponent based on their previous actions.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By starting with cooperation and implementing forgiveness after defection, this strategy encourages cooperative behavior in others while still punishing defectors. This approach capitalizes on the benefits of cooperation while minimizing the cost of being taken advantage of by defectors.
   - The strategy's adaptive nature allows it to respond effectively to a wide range of opponent behaviors, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios and opponents.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Rate (TFT-ACR)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and demonstrate goodwill (C).
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C).
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round but the stock is above the critical point (capacity / (2n)), still cooperate (C). This encourages opponents to return to cooperation.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round and the stock is at or below the critical point, defect (D) to punish them for depleting the common pool excessively. The critical point is chosen based on a threshold value, e.g., 80% of the maximum sustainable stock level (capacity / (2n)).
   - If there was no previous round or the opponent's history is unknown, cooperate (C). This allows for the initial exploration of different opponent behaviors and strategies.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT-ACR(history, stock, capacity, n):
  if len(history) == 0:
    return "C"  # Initial exploration

  last_round = history[-1]
  opponent_action = last_round[opponent_index]

  if opponent_action == "D" and stock <= critical_point:

  elif opponent_action == "D" and stock > critical_point:
    return "C"  # Encourage return to cooperation
  else:
    return opponent_action  # Mimic opponent's action
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as described above (C).
   - In the last round, defect if the stock is at or below the critical point to secure personal payoff and minimize the impact of any subsequent depletion by opponents (D). If the stock is above the critical point, cooperate to encourage cooperation in future iterations of the game (C).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The TFT-ACR strategy encourages opponents to cooperate by initially cooperating and returning cooperation when opponents have not excessively depleted the common pool. However, it also punishes excessive depletion of the common pool, which discourages opponents from exploiting the game. By adapting its cooperation rate based on the state of the common pool and the opponent's previous actions, TFT-ACR aims to achieve a balance between cooperation and exploitation.
   - The strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors due to its adaptive nature and ability to learn from past interactions with opponents. It does not rely on specific coordination mechanisms or shared norms among opponents but instead focuses on reacting to the current state of the game and the opponent's previous actions.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Population Adaptation (TfT-PA) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

Initially, players employ a simple version of the well-known Tit-for-Tat strategy, which involves starting by cooperating and then mimicking their opponent's previous action in subsequent rounds. However, to make the strategy more adaptive and robust, it will be combined with population adaptation:

- Cooperate (C) if the opponent cooperated in the last round; otherwise, Defect (D).
- In each generation (after every 'generation_size' rounds), a fraction 'mutation_rate' of players randomly switch their strategy.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

Since opponents don't have any history to mimic during the initial round, players start by cooperating for the first time. Similarly, in the last round or if 'r' modulo 'generation_size' equals 0 (meaning it's a generation boundary), players switch their strategies according to the mutation rate.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

The TfT-PA strategy is designed to be exploitative by leveraging cooperation when opponents do so, while still having the ability to defect in response to opponent's defections, ultimately aiming to maximize individual payoffs over time. The mutation rate introduces randomness that helps players adapt to various opponent behaviors and maintain a balance between exploitation and cooperation.

Pseudocode:

```python
class Player():
    def __init__(self, strategy, mutation_rate, generation_size):
        self.strategy = strategy  # 'C' or 'D'
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate

        self.history = []  # To store opponent's actions history

    def get_action(self, opponent_action):
        if not self.history:  # First round or new generation

        if len(self.history) % self.generation_size == 0 or random.random() < self.mutation_rate:  # Generation boundary or mutation

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Gradual Cooperation (TFT-GC)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to encourage cooperation from opponents and avoid overexploitation. `if round = 1 then play C`
   - After the first round, adapt strategy based on opponent's behavior in the previous round:
     - If opponent cooperated (played C), return the favor by cooperating in the current round. `if opponent_action_prev == C then play C`
     - If opponent defected (played D) and the stock level is above a certain threshold, retaliate with defection to discourage further exploitation. `if opponent_action_prev == D && stock > threshold then play D`
     - If opponent defected (played D) and the stock level is below the threshold, cooperate to contribute to recovery and encourage cooperation in the future. `if opponent_action_prev == D && stock <= threshold then play C`
   - Define a linear decreasing threshold that adjusts over time to allow for initial depletion of the common pool: `threshold = capacity / r * (1 - round / r)`

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since the game ends regardless of the actions taken, prioritize cooperation by returning any defection made in previous rounds with cooperation. `if round == r then play C if opponent_action_prev == D then play C`

3. Be exploitative:
   - Pursue a combination of cooperative and retaliatory behavior that aims to encourage cooperation while punishing defection, but also accounts for the need to conserve resources in the face of potential overexploitation. The strategy adapts dynamically based on the opponent's behavior and the current state of the common pool.
   - By gradually increasing cooperation as the game progresses, TFT-GC avoids being too exploitative early on while still allowing for strategic retaliation when necessary.

   - If the common pool stock falls below the threshold, defect to gain more resources and punish opponents who deplete the stock excessively. (D if stock <= T)
   - In the last round, cooperate to maximize potential payoff regardless of past behavior. (C in the final round)

2. Edge Cases:
   - If the common pool stock is initially at the threshold or below, defect immediately to secure resources and signal a punishing stance. (D if initial stock <= T)
   - If opponents continuously cooperate, maintain cooperation to build trust and encourage future collaboration. (C if all previous actions were C)
   - If opponents consistently defect, also defect to match their behavior and deplete the common pool faster to gain an advantage. (D if all previous actions were D)
   - If the behavior of opponents is mixed, calculate the average action taken so far, and use it as a reference for deciding current action based on the stock level.

3. Exploitative Mindset:

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TACT) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TACT is designed to strike a balance between cooperation and defection, gradually increasing the probability of cooperation as the common pool resource depletes. The strategy will also retaliate against opponent's defections by matching their actions in subsequent rounds while maintaining a minimum cooperation threshold (MCT) for long-term survival.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function TACT(n, r, capacity, stock, round, history):
       cooperation_threshold = MCT * (capacity - stock) / capacity
       if round = 1:
           action = 0.5 * C + 0.5 * D  # Random initial action
       else:
           opponent_actions = get_opponent_history(history)
           total_defections = sum(opponent_actions)

           if total_defections > round - MCT:
               action = D  # Retaliate against excessive defections
           elif stock < (1 - MCT) * capacity:
               action = C  # Cooperate to preserve the resource

               probability_cooperate = smoothstep(0, MCT, cooperation_threshold)
               action = choose_randomly(C, D, probability_cooperate)
   ```

   - `smoothstep` is a function that returns a value between 0 and 1 according to the input's position within the range [0, MCT] or [MCT, capacity] with a smooth transition at MCT.
   - `choose_randomly` randomly selects one of the given actions with the specified probability.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TACT takes a random action to avoid appearing predictable to opponents. In the last round, TACT will cooperate to maximize the final payoff if the common pool resource still allows it.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TACT is designed to be exploitative by adapting its actions based on the current state of the game and the opponent's history, but it does not aim to exploit the opponents indefinitely. Instead, it focuses on preserving the common pool resource for long-term survival while retaliating against excessive defections from opponents. The MCT ensures that TACT will cooperate enough to maintain a stable resource level over time, making it less vulnerable to exploitation.

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, TfT-G always cooperates to initiate a cooperative environment and show goodwill towards opponents.
   - Subsequent rounds:
      - If all players cooperated in the previous round, TfT-G cooperates in the current round (maintaining cooperation).
      - If any player defected in the previous round, TfT-G defects in the current round as a response to the defection (retaliating against defection).
      - If the stock has reached zero due to previous rounds' actions, TfT-G follows the same rules as for non-zero stocks.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, TfT-G cooperates regardless of the previous round's action to maximize potential payoff (since there are no further rounds).
   - If the stock level falls below the minimum sustainable level, TfT-G will not take actions that would further deplete the stock (i.e., it will only cooperate until the stock reaches the minimum sustainable level).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - By retaliating against defection and maintaining cooperation when others cooperate, TfT-G seeks to exploit the cooperative behavior of opponents while minimizing its own contribution to the stock depletion.
   - However, it also demonstrates goodwill by initiating cooperation in the first round, potentially encouraging opponents to reciprocate over time.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, compare the total consumption from the previous round to a predefined adaptive cooperation threshold. If total consumption is less than or equal to the threshold, cooperate; otherwise defect.
   - The cooperation threshold starts at a low value and increases gradually over time if the stock level remains above a minimum sustainable level (MSL). If the stock falls below MSL, the threshold decreases towards its initial value. This mechanism encourages cooperation when the common resource is plentiful but becomes more exploitative as the resource depletes.
   - Cooperate in the first round since no prior consumption history exists.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if the current stock level is above MSL to allow the common pool to recover for future games. If the stock is below MSL, defect to maximize payoff since there are no more rounds.
   - In case of tie (two or more players having the same total consumption in a previous round), use a random deterministic function to break ties by choosing one player to cooperate and the others to defect. This ensures fairness and prevents possible exploitation due to coincidental ties.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - By adapting the cooperation threshold based on the state of the common pool, TFT-ACT aims to maintain a balance between cooperation and exploitation, taking advantage of opponents who overconsume while still encouraging cooperation when the resource is plentiful.
   - The gradual adjustment of the cooperation threshold allows TFT-ACT to respond dynamically to opponent strategies and game conditions.

Pseudocode:
```python
Parameters: n (number of players), r (number of rounds), capacity, MSL (minimum sustainable level)
State: stock
History: consumption_history (list of total consumptions over previous rounds)
Threshold: initial_threshold (low initial cooperation threshold), final_threshold (higher maximum cooperation threshold)

Function TFT-ACT(round):
  If round == 1:
    Cooperate
  Else:
    Get total consumption from consumption_history[round - 1]
    If total consumption <= current_threshold:
      Cooperate
    Else:
      Defect

  Update current_threshold based on stock level and history:
    If stock > MSL:
      If current_threshold < final_threshold:
        current_threshold += step_size
    Else if stock <= MSL:
      If current_threshold > initial_threshold:
        current_threshold -= step_size

  Update consumption_history with total consumption from this round
```
In the above pseudocode, `step_size` is a small value that determines how quickly the cooperation threshold adjusts. This can be calibrated to achieve the desired level of exploitation and responsiveness to the game state.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In the first round, always cooperate (C) to demonstrate trust and encourage reciprocity. After the initial round, observe other players' actions from the previous round and respond accordingly:
   - If another player cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C). This is a sign of trust and cooperation which can foster long-term benefits.
   - If another player defected in the previous round, defect (D) to punish them for their actions. The hope is that they will learn from the punishment and change their behavior in future rounds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First Round: Cooperate (C) as a gesture of goodwill to encourage cooperation.
   - Last Round: Since players cannot anticipate future interactions, play as if this were not the last round using the decision rules mentioned above.
   - Other edge cases: There are no specific edge cases to handle in this strategy as it remains adaptive throughout the game.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While this strategy does punish defection, it is also forgiving towards cooperation since cooperation leads to mutual benefits. However, the key exploitative aspect comes from taking advantage of opponents who repeatedly defect (punished with defections) while rewarding those who cooperate (with reciprocated cooperation). This dynamic can create a balance between encouraging cooperation and punishing defection, ultimately aiming for higher payoffs than less adaptive strategies.

Pseudocode:
```
def tit_for_tat(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, history):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round as a goodwill gesture
  else:
    opponent_action = history[-1][opponent]  # Get the opponent's last action
    action = "C" if opponent_action == "C" else "D"  # Respond to the opponent's action

  consume = { "C": stock/(2*n), "D": stock/n }[action]  # Calculate consumption based on action and current stock
  total_consumption += consume  # Update total consumption for this round
  stock -= consume  # Update the common pool resource stock level

  if stock <= 0:  # If the common pool resource is depleted, reset the stock to the capacity
    stock = capacity

  growth = 2 * stock * (1 - stock/capacity)  # Calculate the stock growth for this round
  new_stock = min(stock + growth, capacity)  # Update the new common pool resource stock level

  return action, total_consumption, stock, new_stock
```

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In every round, check if the average consumption over the past few rounds exceeds a cooperative threshold. If it does, defect; otherwise, cooperate. The rationale is to punish excessive exploitation while maintaining cooperation when possible.
   - Start with a generous cooperative threshold (e.g., initial_threshold = 1.25). As the game progresses, adjust the threshold based on the opponent's behavior: if the average consumption decreases, gradually lower the threshold; otherwise, incrementally increase it. This adaptability ensures the strategy responds to the opponent's cooperation or defection patterns over time.
   - In case of a tie (i.e., the same number of cooperators and defectors in the recent past), default to cooperating for fairness.

Pseudocode:
```
def tft_act(n, r, capacity, current_round, past_consumptions):
    threshold = initial_threshold  # Set an initial generous cooperative threshold
    consumed_this_round = 0          # Initialize variables for this round's consumption and average consumption

    if current_round == 1:
        # First round: cooperate to foster a cooperative environment
        return 'C'

    for opponent in past_consumptions:
        consumed_this_round += opponent

    average_consumption = consumed_this_round / min(current_round, len(past_consumptions))

    if average_consumption > threshold:
        # Adaptive cooperative threshold: defect when average consumption exceeds the current threshold
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Cooperate to encourage cooperation from opponents
        return 'C'
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, the strategy will cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous behavior as there are no subsequent rounds for retaliation or reward.
   - For the initial rounds, the strategy starts by cooperating to foster a cooperative environment. If opponents quickly take advantage of this kindness, the TFT-ACT strategy will adapt and become more exploitative over time.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-ACT strategy aims to maintain cooperation when possible while punishing excessive exploitation, aligning with an exploitative mindset by retaliating against opponents who consistently defect or overconsume.
   - By gradually adjusting the cooperative threshold based on the opponent's behavior, the strategy becomes adaptive and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors, ensuring it remains competitive in various scenarios against other AI strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_430 = '''
 In this game, we'll develop a Tit-for-Tat (TFT) strategy with a slight twist, named Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT). The ATFT strategy is designed to be exploitative while being robust against various opponent behaviors and adaptive to the game state.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - If it's the first round or there's no history, cooperate (C) since starting cooperatively can encourage cooperation from other players.
   - In subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate as well. This rule maintains mutual cooperation when opponents are also cooperative.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) to punish them for their earlier move. This rule is meant to deter repeated defections from opponents.
   - In both cases, adjust the probability of switching strategies based on the current stock level and capacity. If the stock level drops below a threshold (e.g., 50%), increase the likelihood of defecting to avoid depleting the common pool, and vice versa.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since the game ends soon, it's best to cooperate to maximize potential payoffs. This behavior encourages cooperation in the final stages of the game.
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier since starting cooperatively can encourage cooperation from other players.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy is inherently exploitative due to its punishing nature when opponents defect. By defecting in response to defections, the strategy aims to discourage opponents from taking advantage of it.
   - The probability adjustment rule for stock level also plays a part in being exploitative since it encourages cooperation while ensuring the common pool isn't depleted too quickly. This balance helps maintain a suitable game state for future rounds and payoffs.

Here is a simple pseudocode representation of the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy:

```python
def ATFT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if round == 1 or len(history) == 0:
    action = "C" # Cooperate in first round and when there's no history

  else:
    opponent_action = history[-1] # Get the last opponent's action from history
    if stock < capacity/2:
      probability_defect = min(stock / capacity, 0.5) # Increase likelihood of defecting as stock drops
    else:
      probability_defect = max(stock / capacity, 0.1) # Decrease likelihood of defection as stock rises

    if opponent_action == "C":
      action = "C" with probability (1 - probability_defect)
      action = "D" with probability probability_defect
    elif opponent_action == "D":
      action = "D"

  return action # Return the chosen action
```
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_431 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TFTGA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to provide a positive initial stock growth and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - From the second round onwards, observe opponent's actions in the previous round. If all opponents cooperated (C), cooperate as well. If any opponent defected (D), also defect in the current round. This mimics the "Tit-for-Tat" strategy from game theory, promoting stability and reciprocity.
   - To account for the dynamic stock growth, adjust the strategy with a sensitivity factor α (0 < α < 1) to respond to changes in remaining capacity:
     - If the new stock after consumption is greater than or equal to 90% of the capacity, continue cooperating.
     - If the new stock after consumption is less than 70% of the capacity, defect to ensure the stock level doesn't deplete too fast and hinder future cooperation opportunities.
     - In all other cases (between 70% and 90%), maintain the last played action.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First round: Cooperate regardless of opponent actions due to its cooperative nature and promoting positive stock growth.
   - Last round: If the remaining stock is insufficient for all players to gain a positive payoff (S < r \* n), defect to maximize individual payoff in the given circumstances. In all other cases, maintain the last played action as per decision rules.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The strategy is primarily cooperative and focuses on maintaining a stable stock level for future rounds. However, it adapts to the current state of the game and opponent's actions to maximize payoff while preserving the common pool resource.
   - When opponents defect too much (depleting the stock below 70% capacity), the strategy will also defect to retaliate and help regulate the resource usage. This can be seen as exploitative in a sense that it punishes opponents for over-exploiting the common pool, thus encouraging more cooperation.
   - The sensitivity factor α allows fine-tuning the strategy's aggressiveness or patience, enabling adaptation to various opponent behaviors and game parameters. A lower value of α promotes faster retaliation, while a higher value encourages longer periods of cooperation even when stock levels are low.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_432 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Defection Threshold (TFT-ADT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture and may encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, maintain a Defect Threshold (DT), initially set to 0.5 (meaning at least half of the opponents have defected before you will defect).
   - After each round, update DT as follows:
     - If all opponents cooperate, lower DT slightly (e.g., decrease by 0.01).
     - If all or most opponents defect (DT >= 0.5), raise DT slightly (e.g., increase by 0.01).
     - If the number of opponents who defected in the last round is greater than the number who cooperated, defect in the next round.
     - Otherwise, cooperate.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, if your DT is less than 1, cooperate to maximize potential payoff. If your DT is already equal to or greater than 1, defect to exploit opponents who may still be trying to earn cooperation.
   - In case of a tie (e.g., multiple opponents defecting in the same round), use a random choice or choose the action that benefits you more in the long run based on your current DT.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT-ADT is inherently exploitative as it responds to opponent behavior. If opponents are consistently cooperative, TFT-ADT will continue cooperating and reap the rewards.
   - However, if opponents are prone to defecting, TFT-ADT will gradually increase its DT and start defecting more frequently to match their behavior. This ensures that TFT-ADT does not get taken advantage of while still allowing for potential cooperation when it may benefit the strategy.

Pseudocode:

```
Parameters: n (number of players), r (number of rounds), capacity (maximum sustainable stock level)
Initial State: stock = capacity

Decision function for player i:
def decide(round, opponents_actions, dt):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

  if all(opponents_action == 'C') for opponent in opponents_actions:
    new_dt = dt - 0.01
    return 'C' if new_dt > 0 else 'D'

  if all(opponent_action == 'D') for opponent in opponents_actions or (len([opponent for opponent in opponents_actions if opponent == 'D']) >= len([opponent for opponent in opponents_actions if opponent == 'C'])):
    new_dt = dt + 0.01
    return 'D'

  return 'C'  # Cooperate if none of the above conditions are met
```

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (TFT) with Adaptive Forgiveness

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (initiate cooperatively to foster a sense of trust)
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's previous action and respond accordingly:
     - If opponent cooperated, cooperate as well
     - If opponent defected, defect in the next round but revert to cooperation once the opponent cooperates again (forgive one defection)
     - Keep track of the number of defections by the opponent (defection count) and forgive a limited number of defections before switching to a more aggressive strategy.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, always cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize payoff in the current round.
   - If the opponent has not cooperated at all and the defector's count reaches a threshold (e.g., n/2), switch to a more aggressive strategy like Always Defect (ADD) in order to punish the opponent for their uncooperative behavior.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Initially, TFT offers cooperation but will quickly retaliate against defection, making it hard for opponents to exploit its cooperative nature without facing punishment.
   - The adaptive forgiveness mechanism allows TFT to be more resilient against a wide range of opponent behaviors, adapting to different strategies while still being able to punish repeated defections effectively.

Pseudocode:

```
Strategy TitForTatWithAdaptiveForgiveness(n, r, capacity, initial_stock) {
    defector_count = 0;

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Adaptation (TTFSGA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, TTFSGA cooperates to facilitate a stable environment and encourage reciprocity. This initial cooperation is a goodwill gesture.
   - For subsequent rounds, TTFSGA will follow a Tit-for-Tat approach, initially cooperating and then adapting its behavior based on the opponent's actions in previous rounds:
      - If the opponent cooperates, TTFSGA continues to cooperate. This encourages continued cooperation from the opponent.
      - If the opponent defects, TTFSGA defects as well in the next round. This punishes the opponent for their defection and signals a disapproval of their actions.
      - In subsequent rounds where the opponent continues to defect, TTFSGA evaluates the stock growth after consumption based on the current state and previous states (historical stock growth) to decide whether to continue defecting or revert back to cooperation:
         - If historical stock growth is less than or equal to 1.0 (i.e., the stock does not recover as quickly as it should), TTFSGA continues to defect, maintaining pressure on the opponent to cooperate.
         - If historical stock growth is greater than 1.0 (i.e., the stock is growing more quickly than expected due to the opponent's defections), TTFSGA switches back to cooperation as a sign of goodwill and an attempt to rebuild trust.
      - In case the game reaches its last round, TTFSGA cooperates regardless of the opponent's past behavior to maximize its payoff for the tournament.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - If the current stock level is less than or equal to 0 after consumption in any round, TTFSGA defects in that round as there is no benefit from cooperation in such a state.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - TTFSGA's strategy maintains an exploitative mindset by punishing opponents who defect and rewarding those who cooperate. This encourages opponents to adopt cooperative behavior in order to maximize their payoff over the long term, while also minimizing potential negative impacts on the common pool resource.
   - By evaluating historical stock growth, TTFSGA adapts its strategy based on the dynamics of the game and aims to exploit any opportunities for higher payoffs presented by the game state.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-AC begins by cooperating in the first round, mimicking a peaceful and cooperative approach. After that, it adapts its behavior based on the opponent's previous moves. In each subsequent round:

   - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, TFT-AC cooperates back in this round to reward cooperation.
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, TFT-AC also defects in this round as a form of punishment for defection. This aims to enforce reciprocity and discourage defection.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - First round: Cooperate (as mentioned earlier)
   - Last round (r): TFT-AC considers the total payoff gained over all rounds so far. If the total payoff is greater when cooperating than defecting, it cooperates in the last round to maximize its overall payoff. If the opposite is true, it defects in the last round as a form of final punishment.
   - Other edge cases (e.g., mid-game): TFT-AC does not have any predetermined patterns or schedules for cooperation. Its decision is solely based on the opponent's previous moves.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TFT-AC is designed to be exploitative in its response to defection. By defecting when an opponent has previously defected, it punishes that behavior and incentivizes cooperation. Conversely, by cooperating when an opponent has previously cooperated, it rewards that behavior and encourages continued cooperation. This strategy aims to exploit the opponent's actions while maintaining a strong position in the game.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFT_AC(opponent_history):
  # Initialize total payoff (for r rounds)
  total_payoff = 0

  # Initialize opponent's history for current round (previous moves)
  current_round_history = [None] * n

  # Play the game for r rounds
  for round in range(1, r+1):
    # Update history for current round
    current_round_history[round - 1] = opponent_action_in_previous_round

    # Decide on action based on opponent's history

      action = choose_random_action()

    # Take action and update payoff
    payoff_in_this_round = get_payoff(stock, action)
    total_payoff += payoff_in_this_round

  # If it's the last round, decide on final action based on total payoff
  if round == r:
    if total_payoff_with_cooperation > total_payoff_with_defection:
      action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the last round

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Forgiveness (TfT-AF)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round t, TfT-AF decides its action based on the opponent's behavior in the previous round (t-1). If the opponent cooperated in the last round, TfT-AF also cooperates. If the opponent defected, TfT-AF defects but with an adaptive forgiveness mechanism that encourages cooperation after a series of defections.

Pseudocode:
```
def TfT_AF(opponent_action_history):
  if len(opponent_action_history) == 0:
    return 'C'   # First round, cooperate to show kindness

  current_opponent_action = opponent_action_history[-1]
  if current_opponent_action == 'C':
    return 'C'   # Cooperate as a reciprocal gesture
  elif len(opponent_action_history) <= FORGIVENESS_WINDOW:
    return 'D'    # Defect to punish opponent for defecting
  else:
    last_cooperation = opponent_action_history[-FORGIVENESS_WINDOW - 1]
    if last_cooperation == 'C':
      return 'C'   # Forgive and cooperate again
    else:
      return 'D'    # Continue punishing the opponent
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, TfT-AF starts by cooperating to show kindness to the opponent. In the last round, TfT-AF aims for a higher payoff by defecting since there are no further rounds to punish or be punished.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

While not strictly exploitative as it cooperates in most situations, TfT-AF can be seen as slightly exploitative due to its adaptive forgiveness mechanism. When an opponent defects, TfT-AF will continue to punish them for a short period before potentially returning to cooperation again. This strategy discourages opponents from continually defeating TfT-AF while also allowing for opportunities to cooperate and gain higher payoffs when the opponent does choose to cooperate. The forgiveness window parameter can be adjusted based on the average number of rounds played to better align with various game settings.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_437 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Forgiveness (TFT-AF)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, TFT-AF follows a tit-for-tat strategy where it initially cooperates and then mimics the opponent's action from the previous round. To prevent early exploitation, TFT-AF introduces an adaptive forgiveness mechanism: if an opponent defects in the first few rounds (e.g., first 3 rounds), TFT-AF forgives them by continuing to cooperate for a certain number of additional rounds before resuming tit-for-tat behavior.

Pseudocode:
```
if round < FORGIVENESS_PERIOD and opponent defected in the previous round:
    action = Cooperate
else if round > FORGIVENESS_PERIOD and opponent cooperated in the previous round:
    action = Cooperate
else if round > FORGIVENESS_PERIOD and opponent defected in the previous round:
    action = Defect
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, TFT-AF cooperates to show goodwill towards other players. In the last round or when the stock is depleted (i.e., no more resources can be consumed), TFT-AF does not adapt its strategy because there will be no subsequent rounds.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

By initially cooperating and then mimicking opponents' actions, TFT-AF encourages other players to cooperate as well in the beginning. However, if an opponent tries to take advantage of TFT-AF by defecting repeatedly, it will retaliate by also defecting. The adaptive forgiveness mechanism allows TFT-AF to give second chances to opponents who may have made a mistake or been exploited themselves in the past. This strategy aims to maximize payoffs by exploiting opponents when possible while maintaining the potential for cooperation and minimizing payoff losses from defection.

Note: The specific values of FORGIVENESS_PERIOD and other tuning parameters can be determined experimentally or through reinforcement learning to optimize performance against a variety of opponent strategies in tournaments.

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate (C). This is a gesture of goodwill and establishes an initial stock level that allows for growth.
   - From round 2 to r-1, follow Tit-for-Tat strategy. If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate; if they defected, defect in the current round. This encourages cooperation when reciprocated but punishes defection.
   - In the last round (t=r), regardless of the opponent's action in the previous round, always cooperate to maximize the payoff for this single round.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If the stock level falls below 0 after consumption in any round due to opponents defecting, set the new stock to 1 (the lowest possible non-zero value) to avoid game termination and allow recovery of the common pool resource over subsequent rounds.
   - In case of an empty stock level at the start of a round (e.g., from a previous round's consumption exceeding capacity), set the new stock to 1 as well to ensure fairness in the first action of the round.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The ATfT strategy is inherently exploitative as it retaliates against opponents who defect and rewards those who cooperate, encouraging a balance between cooperation and defection. However, it prioritizes self-interest by always cooperating in the last round to maximize its own payoff without regard for the opponent's behavior. This can lead to uncooperative outcomes when faced with unyieldingly defective opponents but is effective against a wide range of strategies due to its adaptability and robustness.

Pseudocode:
```python
def ATfT(n, r, capacity, stock, round, opponent_history):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C' # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round < r:
        if opponent_history[-1] == 'C':
            action = 'C' # Cooperate when opponent cooperated last time
        else:
            action = 'D' # Defect when opponent defected last time
    else:
        action = 'C' # Always cooperate in the last round

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (initiate cooperation)
   - In subsequent rounds, compare the opponent's average action (cooperative or defective) over the last 'm' rounds with a predefined adaptive threshold 'τ'.
   - If the average action is more cooperative than τ, cooperate. Otherwise, defect to punish non-cooperation.
   - To calculate the threshold 'τ', apply a decay function that fades recent experiences:
     - Set initial threshold 'τ' equal to the average cooperation rate in the first 'k' rounds (where k < m)
     - After each round, decrease 'τ' by a small constant factor 'α' if opponent cooperated in the last round; increase 'τ' by the same factor 'α' if opponent defected.
   - If the threshold falls below 0 or exceeds 1, reset it to the minimum and maximum values respectively.

Pseudocode:
```
Initialization:
- Set m, k, α (parameters)
- Initialize round counter t = 0
- Set stock S = capacity
- Set threshold τ = average_cooperation_rate(t=1..k)

Loop for each round t:
  - If t > k: update τ according to opponent's actions and decay factor α
  - Calculate opponent's average action over last m rounds
  - Cooperate or defect based on comparison with τ
  - Update stock S and calculate growth, new stock, payoff π_i
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to initiate cooperation
   - In the last round, cooperate if the opponent has been relatively cooperative throughout the game; defect otherwise

3. Be exploitative:
   - Start by being cooperative to build trust and gain higher payoffs in the initial stages
   - Adaptively punish non-cooperative opponents by defecting when they are not meeting the cooperation threshold
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and punishment through an adaptive threshold that fades recent experiences and encourages opponent's cooperative behavior.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Resilience (TfTAR)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (round 1), TfTAR cooperates to demonstrate trust and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - In subsequent rounds, TfTAR will cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, it will defect to punish the opponent for previous defection. This replicates the Tit-for-Tat strategy from game theory.
   - To increase adaptability, TfTAR implements a forgiveness mechanism: after a string of mutual defections (e.g., 3 consecutive defections), TfTAR will cooperate as an attempt to reestablish cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, TfTAR will always cooperate (as stated above).
   - If the current round is the last round (r = 1), TfTAR will defect as there are no subsequent rounds for opponents to be punished or rewarded.
   - To handle situations where an opponent never cooperates, TfTAR will continue to cooperate until a predefined number of consecutive defections occurs, at which point it will switch to always defecting (to avoid further stock depletion).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - By initially cooperating and then adapting behavior based on opponent actions, TfTAR demonstrates an exploitative strategy: it seeks to benefit from cooperation when possible while punishing opponents who fail to cooperate.
   - The forgiveness mechanism also allows TfTAR to take advantage of opponents that may make mistakes or change strategies during the game, encouraging them to revert to cooperation in hopes of receiving future benefits.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (TFTSG) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round (C). This sets a cooperative tone and reduces initial stock depletion.
   - In subsequent rounds, initially follow the opponent's action from the previous round (mirror strategy). If opponent cooperated (C), also cooperate (C). If opponent defected (D), defect as well (D).
   - If the total consumption in any round exceeds 50% of the current stock (Total_Consumption > Stock / 2), defect (D) for the next round to protect against overexploitation and encourage a more sustainable resource management. This is an exploitative move that aims to punish excessive depletion by opponents.
   - If the game enters the last round, always cooperate (C), as it maximizes the payoff in the final round regardless of opponent's strategy.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, start by cooperating (C).
   - If the current round is the last one, always cooperate (C).
   - If the total consumption exceeds 50% of the current stock, defect (D) in the next round only if it's not the final round.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The TFTSG strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection strategically while prioritizing a sustainable resource management approach. By defecting when the total consumption exceeds 50% of the current stock, the strategy punishes overexploitation by opponents, which can be seen as an exploitative move.
   - However, the TFTSG strategy also encourages cooperation by initially cooperating in the first round and mirroring the opponent's actions, creating opportunities for sustainable resource management and high payoffs when both players cooperate. This balance between cooperation and defection aligns with the exploitative mindset by taking advantage of opponents that overexploit the common pool while fostering a more collaborative environment when appropriate.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFTSG(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
  else:
    if Total_Consumption > Stock / 2 and round < r:
      # Defect when total consumption exceeds 50% of current stock (exploitative move)
      action = "D"
    elif opponent_action[round-1] == "C":
      # Cooperate if opponent cooperated in the previous round
      action = "C"
    else:
      # Defect if opponent defected or no information about opponent's last action (default to defection)

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a trust relationship. `if round = 1 then play C`
   - After the first round, analyze opponent's behavior and respond accordingly:
     - If opponent cooperates (played C), cooperate back in the next round. `if opponent played C in previous round then play C`
     - If opponent defected (played D), defect in the next round to punish them for not cooperating. `if opponent played D in previous round then play D`
   - Adapt stock consumption based on the remaining stock level:
     - If the remaining stock is above average, consume less than the minimum required to ensure growth. This helps preserve resources for future rounds and encourages opponents to cooperate.
       `if stock > (average_stock * 0.8) then play C with a lower consumption rate, e.g., consume stock / (2n + d), where d is a constant that controls the level of exploitation.`
     - If the remaining stock is below average, consume more than the minimum required to ensure growth. This forces opponents to cooperate to prevent further depletion of resources.
       `if stock < (average_stock * 0.2) then play C with a higher consumption rate, e.g., consume stock / (2n - d), where d is a constant that controls the level of exploitation.`
     - If the remaining stock is close to the average, consume the minimum required to ensure growth and continue analyzing opponent behavior. `if |stock - average_stock| < threshold then play C with regular consumption rate`.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff over preserving resources:
     `if round = r then play D to get a higher payoff in the final round`
   - In other special cases (e.g., low or high initial stock level), apply appropriate adjustments to the decision rules based on the specific requirements of each case.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and defection to take advantage of opponents who are not cooperating while still preserving resources for future rounds when needed.
   - Adapt stock consumption based on the remaining stock level to either encourage or force opponents to cooperate, maximizing payoff over time.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially, cooperate in the first round to build trust and demonstrate goodwill (C).
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's previous actions and respond accordingly:
      - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C).
      - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in this round (D) to punish their action. However, if more than half of the opponents have cooperated in the last three rounds, revert back to cooperating (C). This rule encourages cooperation and reduces punishment when there is a trend of collaboration among opponents.
      - If less than half of the opponents have cooperated in the last three rounds, continue defecting (D) to maintain the punishment against non-cooperative behavior.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, if it is advantageous to maximize payoff, defect (D) even if all opponents cooperated in the previous round. This ensures that the TfTA strategy gets as much as possible in the final round.
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to build trust and demonstrate goodwill.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TfTA strategy is inherently exploitative by punishing opponents who defect and rewarding those who cooperate. This encourages cooperation as long as it is reciprocated, but also allows for swift punishment when necessary to maintain the TfTA's own payoff.
   - By adapting its response based on the recent behavior of opponents, the TfTA strategy remains responsive and adaptable to a wide range of opponent behaviors while maintaining an exploitative mindset.

Pseudocode:

```python

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TFT-A)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and establish trust.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's behavior and respond accordingly:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back in the current round.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, also defect in the current round to teach them a lesson.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - In the last round, cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round or if there is a chance of winning (i.e., if defection would cause the common pool to deplete, but cooperation results in higher payoff). Otherwise, defect.
   - When the stock reaches 0 and growth cannot occur, stop playing as the game becomes impossible to continue.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - TFT-A is not inherently exploitative at first glance but can be seen as exploitative in its adaptive response to opponent's behavior. By defecting when opponents do, it ensures that both players get a lower payoff compared to mutual cooperation. However, by cooperating when opponents do, TFT-A also encourages cooperation and potentially higher overall payoffs for both players compared to purely exploitative strategies like Always Defect.

Pseudocode:

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive Strategy (TfT-Adapt)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always Cooperate to encourage trust and avoid overly punishing opponents (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, initially Cooperate but switch to Defecting if an opponent has previously Defected against you (if there's a history of defection).
   - If an opponent switches from Defecting to Cooperating after having Defected earlier, temporarily forgive them and Cooperate again for forgiveness period 'f' rounds. Set f = floor(n/2) to balance exploitation and cooperation.
   - After the forgiveness period ends, resume the strategy of switching to Defecting if the opponent has previously Defected against you.
   - If an opponent has consistently Cooperated throughout, always continue Cooperating (C).
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff based on current stock and remaining rounds played against that opponent:
     - If there's a history of cooperation, continue Cooperating (C) to secure maximum payoff.
     - If an opponent has previously Defected against you, switch to Defecting (D) to punish them and gain a higher payoff compared to the forgiveness period.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, always Cooperate as described above.
   - In the last round, apply the decision rules mentioned under "Specify decision rules".
   - For all other rounds, maintain the TfT-Adapt strategy as outlined previously.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - Mimic cooperative behavior initially to build trust and encourage opponents to Cooperate (exploiting their willingness to cooperate).
   - Punish Defectors by switching to Defecting after their first defection, providing an incentive for cooperation.
   - Offer forgiveness for past mistakes by temporarily returning to a cooperative strategy once an opponent switches from Defecting to Cooperating (exploiting opponents' desire to rebuild trust).
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff based on current stock and remaining rounds played against that opponent, taking advantage of any opportunities for higher payoffs.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Greed Strategy (TFTG)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to help build up the common pool and provide an opportunity for a mutually beneficial environment. This act can also serve as a signal of goodwill.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the average consumption rate of opponents from previous rounds (excluding the first). If the total consumption is more than the sustainable rate (i.e., greater than 2n), defect to punish high consumers and encourage conservation. Otherwise, cooperate to maintain or grow the common pool.
   - If an opponent ever consumes the entire stock in a single round, immediately defect in the following round as a severe punishment.
   - In the last round, if the current consumption rate is sustainable, continue to cooperate; otherwise, defect. This decision ensures that the strategy does not over-invest in the final round when the game is nearly over.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, play C (Cooperate) regardless of the opponents' actions or the current state.
   - If an opponent consumes the entire stock during a single round, switch to D (Defect) for the next round and revert to decision rule 1 afterwards.
   - When the common pool is close to depletion, the strategy becomes more cautious and may not cooperate as much to prevent over-exploitation.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFTG strategy adapts to opponents' actions and aims to punish those who consume excessively, while rewarding cooperative behavior by contributing to the common pool when it is in their best interest.
   - When an opponent consumes less than the sustainable rate, the strategy cooperates to encourage further cooperation, but if they exceed it, the strategy retaliates with a punishment to discourage excessive consumption.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to establish a cooperative relationship and build trust with opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the average cooperative behavior of opponents over the past 'k' rounds (a flexible lookback window).
   - If the average cooperative rate is above a certain threshold (T), continue cooperating; if below T, defect. The threshold T can be adjusted based on the opponent's past actions and the remaining number of rounds.
   - When the game nears its end (last few rounds), prioritize maximizing personal payoff by taking advantage of opponents who have been previously uncooperative or are more likely to defect in the future.

Pseudocode:
```

  stock = capacity                     // Initialize stock
  history = []                         // Initialize empty history
  threshold = (2 * n) / (r + 1)        // Initial cooperation threshold
  cooperative_rate = 0                  // Initialize cooperative rate

  for round in range(1, r+1):          // For each round
    average_cooperative_rate = calculateAverageCooperativeRate(history, k)  // Calculate the average cooperative rate over the last 'k' rounds

    if (average_cooperative_rate > threshold):

  total_payoff = calculateTotalPayoff() // Sum up payoffs over all rounds

  return total_payoff                   // Return total payoff as the final outcome
}
```

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the first round, players cooperate to encourage others to do the same, which can lead to more cooperative outcomes later in the game.
   - When the game nears its end (last few rounds), TFT-ACT prioritizes maximizing personal payoff by taking advantage of opponents who have been previously uncooperative or are more likely to defect in the future.

3. Being exploitative:
   - By adjusting the cooperation threshold based on the remaining number of rounds, TFT-ACT becomes less cooperative towards the end, allowing it to take advantage of opponents that have behaved uncooperatively during the game.
   - The strategy's adaptive behavior ensures it responds to the opponents' actions, making it more likely to maximize its payoff compared to other strategies that don't adapt to the opponent's behavior.

   - In the last round or when reaching a predefined threshold of cooperation from opponents, start cooperating again (Forgiveness phase), encouraging long-term cooperation.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C).
   - If the game is about to end and opponent has cooperated in the last few rounds, continue cooperating (to encourage a potential Forgiveness phase).
   - If the game is about to end and opponent has not cooperated in the last few rounds, defect (D) to exploit their lack of cooperation.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - Tftt+ prioritizes reciprocity, which can be seen as a form of strategic exploitation. By cooperating when opponents do and punishing them when they don't, it encourages long-term cooperation while still being able to take advantage of short-term selfishness. This strategy maintains a balance between collaboration and competition.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate to demonstrate a cooperative initial intent and allow the opponent to build up the common pool resources. (Cooperate(t=1))
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1):
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), reciprocate cooperation by also cooperating. (Cooperate(t) if Cooperated(t-1))
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round (t-1), punish them by defecting as well, aiming to lower their payoff and encourage a return to cooperation later. (Defect(t) if Defected(t-1))
   - A forgiving mechanism is implemented: after t_forgiveness rounds of defection from the opponent, return to cooperating with the hope that the opponent may reciprocate again. (Cooperate(t) if Defected(t-1) AND t > t_forgiveness)
   - The strategy adjusts t_forgiveness dynamically throughout the game based on recent opponent behavior:
       - If the opponent cooperates, reduce t_forgiveness to encourage further cooperation.
       - If the opponent defects, increase t_forgiveness to punish them more harshly and discourage defection in the future.
   - To account for a potential free rider, always cooperate at some fixed frequency f_cooperate even if the opponent has been defecting recently (to avoid depleting the common pool completely).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round (t=r): Since there are no future rounds to consider, simply aim to maximize the payoff in this final round based on the current state of the game. If the current stock level is low due to repeated defection from the opponent, defect to deplete the resources further and gain a higher individual payoff at the expense of lower overall resource levels for future games. (Defect(t=r) if Stock_level(t-1) < threshold and r = t)
   - First round (t=1): Cooperate as described above.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy seeks to take advantage of the opponent's defection by punishing them with defections, thus encouraging cooperation from the opponent in future rounds and increasing overall payoffs for both players.
   - By adjusting t_forgiveness dynamically based on recent opponent behavior, the strategy attempts to outmaneuver opponents who may employ mixed strategies of cooperation and defection.
   - The forgiving mechanism allows the strategy to be more resilient against repeated defections from opponents while still encouraging cooperation when it benefits the strategy's long-term interests.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (with Stock Management)

1. Decision Rules:

   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back (C). This maintains a positive relationship while benefiting from their cooperation.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) against them. This punishes the defection but leaves room for reconciliation if they change strategy later.
   - In case of multiple opponents, apply these rules individually to each one.
   - If no history exists, cooperate (C).

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, defect against all opponents to maximize personal gain.
   - In case of a tie in terms of cooperation or defection, still cooperate (C) as it may lead to a better outcome if the opponent chooses to switch strategy later.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By alternating between cooperation and defection based on opponents' actions, this strategy aims to take advantage of their cooperation when possible while minimizing potential losses due to defections.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate by playing action C to build a good reputation and encourage cooperation from other players.
   - For subsequent rounds (t > 1), observe and mimic the opponent's actions from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round; if the opponent defected, defect in the current round. This tit-for-tat approach maintains a cooperative relationship as long as the opponent cooperates but punishes defection with equal defection.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - If it's the last round (t=r), continue the tit-for-tat strategy by mimicking the opponent's action from the previous round, even if it's the final move.
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of the stock level since this strategy aims to encourage cooperation in the long run.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Although not traditionally considered an "exploitative" strategy, the Tit-for-Tat approach can be seen as exploiting opponents who repeatedly defect by retaliating with defection, eventually leading to a depleted stock and lower payoff for such opponents. On the other hand, cooperative players are rewarded with higher payoffs since the strategy tends to reciprocate cooperation.
   - It should be noted that this strategy avoids direct exploitation of fellow players by not intentionally acting in ways that harm them excessively or deplete the resource beyond repair, but instead encourages a balance between cooperation and competition to maximize long-term payoff.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate to build trust and promote cooperation in future rounds. If any player defects, adopt a punishing approach from the second round onwards.
   - In subsequent rounds, if the total stock depletion (total consumption) is less than or equal to the current capacity multiplied by a coefficient (Coefficient_T), cooperate; otherwise, defect. This coefficient can be adjusted based on the opponent's behavior and game parameters.
   - If the remaining stock drops below a certain threshold (Threshold_S), adopt an aggressive strategy of always defecting to ensure survival.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, consider the current total stock depletion and apply the same decision rules as mentioned in point 1 above.
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's actions since the goal is to build trust and promote cooperation.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The strategy prioritizes self-interest while considering the impact on future interactions with opponents. Cooperating when total consumption is low encourages others to do the same, but defecting when total consumption exceeds a certain threshold punishes excessive depletion of the common pool and discourages exploitation.
   - If an opponent repeatedly defects, the strategy will also adopt a punishing approach by defecting in response. However, if an opponent demonstrates cooperative behavior after initial defections (e.g., by reducing total consumption), the strategy may gradually rebuild trust and resume cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TfT_ACT(n, r, capacity, coefficient_T, threshold_S):
    stock = capacity
    round_num = 1
    while round_num <= r:
        total_consumption = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if stock / (2*n) <= total_consumption + (i * coefficient_T * capacity) or stock < threshold_S:
                action = 'Defect'
            else:
                action = 'Cooperate'
            total_consumption += action == 'Defect'
        stock -= total_consumption
        growth = 2 * min(stock, capacity) * (1 - stock / capacity)
        stock = min(capacity, stock + growth)
        round_num += 1
    return total_payoff

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and show goodwill towards opponents.
   - After the initial round, monitor opponent's behavior in previous rounds to determine current round action.
   - If an opponent has consistently cooperated in the past 'cooperation_history' rounds, cooperate as well (Tit-for-Tat).
   - If an opponent has defected in 'defection_history' consecutive rounds, defect to punish and deter further defection (punishment phase).
   - If the opponent's behavior does not match either of the above patterns, cooperate if current stock is above a certain threshold 'cooperation_threshold'. This adaptive cooperation helps maintain the common pool resource.
     Pseudocode:
     ```
     function TFT-ACT(history, cooperation_history, defect_history, cooperation_threshold)
         if round = 1 then
             return Cooperate()
         end if

         if length(history) >= cooperation_history and all(history[-cooperation_history:] == Cooperate()) then
             return Cooperate()
         end if

         if length(history) >= defect_history and all(history[-defect_history:] == Defect()) then
             return Defect()
         end if

         if current_stock > cooperation_threshold then
             return Cooperate()
         else
             return Defect()
         end if
     ```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last round, the strategy will cooperate regardless of the opponent's behavior to maximize its payoff in that specific round.
   - If the cooperation_history or defect_history exceed the remaining rounds (r), set them to the remaining rounds to ensure the strategy adapts based on available data.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT is exploitative in nature, as it punishes opponents who defect and encourages cooperation when opponents exhibit good behavior. However, the adaptive cooperation threshold allows for resource preservation while still being able to defect when necessary to maintain the common pool's sustainability.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_454 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Factor (ATFSGF)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round i (1 ≤ i ≤ r), player adopts the following decision rules:
     - If the remaining stock S is less than a threshold T (initially set to 2n), defect (action D).
     - Else, cooperate (action C) if the opponent's action in the previous round was also C; otherwise, defect (action D).

2. Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate (S is initially at capacity)
   - Last Round: Player will defect regardless of current stock level, as they are focusing on their final payoff and not incentivizing future rounds for others.

3. Exploitative Strategy:
   - The ATFSGF strategy is designed to punish opponents who exploit the common pool and reward cooperative opponents by gradually increasing the threshold T when opponent consistently cooperates, thus reducing the tendency to defect in the future. This can lead to a more stable and favorable stock level over time.
   - To be more aggressive towards opponents with a history of non-cooperation, players could implement an escalating punishment mechanism that lowers the threshold T at a higher rate when opponents continue to defect, making it harder for them to recover from their exploitative behavior.

Pseudocode:
```
function ATFSGF(round, stock, opponent_action_history) {
  if (round == 1) return "C"; // First round, cooperate

  // Initialize threshold and opponent cooperation history (defaults to false)
  let T = 2 * n;
  let opponent_cooperated = false;

  for i in range(length(opponent_action_history)):
    if (opponent_action_history[i] == "C"):
      opponent_cooperated = true;
      break;

  // Check if stock level is below the threshold or opponent has not cooperated
  if (stock < T || !opponent_cooperated):
    return "D"; // Defect

  // Reward cooperation and gradually increase threshold T
  let newT = T + (stock / n);
  if (opponent_action_history[-1] == "C"):
    opponent_cooperated = true;
    T = newT;

  return "C"; // Cooperate

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy with Stock Growth Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average stock level over the previous r rounds. If the average stock level is above the initial capacity, cooperate (C). Otherwise, defect (D). This rule ensures a more conservative approach when resources are scarce and a more cooperative one when resources are abundant.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function evaluateAverageStock(rounds):
       return sum(stock_levels[t] for t in (r-1)..0) / r

   function decideAction(current_round, stock_level, average_stock, r):
       if average_stock > capacity:
           return "C"  # Cooperate
       else:
           return "D"  # Defect
   ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, since there is no history, assume a moderate approach by cooperating (C) to encourage cooperation from others.
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing own payoff based on the current state and average stock over r rounds.

3. Be exploitative:
   - While appearing cooperative in the first round, the strategy will become progressively more exploitative as the game progresses by taking advantage of opponents who consistently defect or do not follow fair resource management (i.e., maintaining a high average stock level). This allows TFTSA to maximize its own payoff while discouraging unfair behavior from other players.

Pseudocode:
```
function decideFirstRoundAction(stock_level, r):
    return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

function decideLastRoundAction(current_round, stock_level, average_stock, r):
    if average_stock > capacity:
        return "D"  # Defect in the last round if average stock level is too high
    else:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the last round if average stock level is not too high
```
The TFTSA strategy attempts to find a balance between cooperation and exploitation, adapting its behavior based on the current state of the common pool resource and the history of resource management by other players. By encouraging fair resource management and punishing those who do not follow it, this strategy aims to maximize payoff while promoting sustainable use of the common pool resources in the long run.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Resilience (ATfTSR)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate (C). This gesture of goodwill may encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds, but it's also a one-time offer to take advantage of defectors who might think the opponent is always cooperative.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe other players' actions from previous rounds and adapt accordingly:
       - If all opponents cooperate in the last round, continue cooperating (C). Rewarding cooperation fosters a cooperative environment.
       - If any opponent defected in the last round, defect (D) this round to punish the defector for their previous action. If multiple opponents defected, choose the one with the most recent act of defection to punish first. Maintain this punishing behavior until all opponents start cooperating again.
       - In case of a mixed situation where some players cooperate and others defect in the last round, evaluate each opponent's history:
           - If an opponent has been consistently cooperative, continue cooperating (C).
           - If an opponent has been consistently defective, defect (D) this round.
           - For oscillating opponents (cooperated and defected about equally), defect (D) this round to show that the strategy will not tolerate defection.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if all opponents have been cooperative, continue cooperating (C). A final gesture of goodwill may encourage future collaborations beyond this tournament.
   - If the stock becomes depleted at any point during a game, switch to defecting until the stock reaches a sufficient level for cooperation. This will help maintain the stock level while punishing opponents who have contributed to its depletion.
   - When the stock is about to reach the capacity limit, cooperate (C) to avoid exhausting the resource and potentially starving future rounds.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The ATfTSR strategy maintains a balance between cooperation and defection, adapting its behavior based on other players' actions. This approach encourages cooperation when it is beneficial but also swiftly punishes defection to maximize payoff.
   - By observing opponents' past behaviors and adjusting the strategy accordingly, ATfTSR takes advantage of opponents who adopt non-cooperative strategies, while still offering opportunities for cooperation to those who demonstrate good faith. This approach can be seen as exploitative in the sense that it uses information about opponents' past actions to optimize its own performance.

Pseudocode:
```
def ATfTSR(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    # Initial decision rule
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C'

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Defection (TfTAD)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a gesture of goodwill and allows for potential long-term cooperation.
   - From the second round onwards, follow the Tit-for-Tat strategy: if an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round; otherwise, cooperate (C). This strategy encourages reciprocity while being punitive towards defection.
   - To adapt to a wider range of opponent behaviors, implement an "escalation" feature: if an opponent consistently defects for several rounds (e.g., more than 60% of the time), start cooperating less frequently (i.e., with a lower probability) in order to avoid being taken advantage of.
   - To minimize vulnerability, include a "forgiveness" component: if an opponent who has been repeatedly defecting starts cooperating again, gradually increase the cooperation probability over several rounds.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of previous opponent actions to maximize payoff in that specific round.
   - If an opponent switches from defection to cooperation at any point during the game, follow the forgiveness rule and gradually increase cooperation probability over several rounds.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The TfTAD strategy is inherently exploitative as it punishes opponents who do not cooperate while rewarding cooperation. By being less cooperative in response to repeated defection, the strategy encourages opponents to cooperate more frequently to maximize their own payoffs. This promotes a balance between cooperation and defection that benefits the TfTAD strategy over time.
   - The escalation feature allows for a more aggressive response when faced with highly exploitative opponents, ensuring that the TfTAD strategy does not become too generous and maintain an exploitative edge.

Pseudocode:

```python
class TitForTatAdaptiveDefector(object):
    def __init__(self, n, r, capacity):

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TFTG)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFTG starts by cooperating in the first round to build trust and contribute positively to the common pool, hoping that other players will reciprocate. In subsequent rounds:
   - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating as a sign of good faith.
   - If at least one opponent defected in the previous round, also defect in the current round as a punishment for their selfish behavior and as a signal to encourage cooperation in future rounds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C).
   - If it's the last round or the game reaches a critical stock level close to zero (e.g., when (capacity - stock) < threshold), always defect to maximize individual payoff in the remaining rounds.
   - When encountering a long streak of defections, switch to permanent defection mode to minimize losses due to constant exploitation. However, if there is a turnaround and opponents start cooperating again, return to TFTG strategy.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While TFTG promotes cooperation, it is also designed to be robust against repeated defections by adopting a punishing mechanism. This allows the strategy to capitalize on opponent's mistakes and take advantage of their selfish behavior in the short term while still promoting cooperation in the long run. The TFTG strategy seeks an equilibrium where players cooperate most of the time, but also punish each other when necessary to maintain the common pool's sustainability.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFTG(opponents, round_number, capacity, threshold):
    stock = capacity
    strategy = "C"  # Cooperate by default
    history = []

    while round_number > 0:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Rate (TFTACR)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - TFTACR cooperates initially (first round) to build trust and encourage reciprocity, then follows the opponent's actions for a specified number of rounds.
   - After evaluating the opponent's behaviour over time, TFTACR adjusts its cooperation rate based on the average percentage of times the opponent has chosen to cooperate or defect during the observed period.
   - If the opponent cooperates more than 50% of the time, TFTACR increases its own cooperation rate to encourage continued reciprocity.
   - If the opponent defects more than 50% of the time, TFTACR decreases its cooperation rate to reduce losses from being exploited.
   - In cases where the opponent's behaviour is indeterminate (i.e., close to a 50/50 split), TFTACR maintains a moderate cooperation rate as a default strategy.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to initiate reciprocity and encourage trust-building.
   - In the last round (rth round), TFTACR uses its current evaluation of the opponent's behaviour to determine whether to cooperate or defect, as this decision will not impact future rounds.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFTACR aims to maximize payoffs by exploiting opponents when possible, while also being adaptive and robust to various strategies.
   - By adjusting its cooperation rate based on the opponent's behaviour, TFTACR can identify and take advantage of opponents with consistently cooperative or defective strategies.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth Adaptation (TFT-SGA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This gesture of goodwill might encourage others to reciprocate in later rounds.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from the previous round and adapt accordingly:
       a. If all opponents cooperated in the last round, cooperate. Rewarding cooperation can foster long-term cooperation.
       b. If at least one opponent defected (D) in the last round, defect this round to punish the defection and encourage future cooperation.
   - The decision rule also considers the current stock level and stock growth:
       a. If the new stock level (after consumption and growth) is below a threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), always defect to prevent rapid depletion of resources.
       b. If the new stock level is above the threshold, use the rule based on opponent's actions from the previous round.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Cooperate if all opponents cooperated in the last-but-one round; defect otherwise. This ensures a final act of goodwill or punishment, depending on the opponent's recent behavior.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-SGA strategy is designed to be both forgiving (cooperating) and punishing (defecting), which makes it difficult for opponents to predict its actions. This unpredictability can deter opponents from repeatedly defecting, as they risk being punished and losing resources in the long run.
   - The stock growth consideration adds an extra layer of exploitation by ensuring the strategy prioritizes the preservation of common resources, especially when those resources are low or depleting rapidly. This can discourage other strategies that focus solely on short-term gains at the expense of the common pool's long-term sustainability.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_461 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, I propose a strategy named Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) which is designed to be exploitative yet robust against various opponent behaviors. The ATfT strategy seeks to punish defection while maintaining cooperation when possible to promote mutual benefit.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate as a goodwill gesture: C
   - In subsequent rounds, imitate opponents' actions from the previous round: If opponent_i played C in the last round, play C; if opponent_i played D, play D. This encourages cooperation but punishes defection.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's action since payoff is calculated over all rounds and punishing the opponent at this point would not affect the overall outcome. However, in the context of multiple games within a tournament, it could make sense to defect if there are no future interactions with the same opponent.
   - In case of a tie (multiple opponents defecting or cooperating), play C to promote cooperation and minimize stock depletion.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Although not strictly an exploitative strategy, ATfT does have an exploitative aspect in that it punishes defection by mimicking the opponent's action. This encourages opponents to cooperate whenever possible to maximize their own payoff while still maintaining some level of cooperation for mutual benefit.

Here is a simple pseudocode representation of the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy:

```python
def Adaptive_Tit_for_Tat(opponent_action, round_number):
    if round_number == 1:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        action = opponent_action  # Imitate opponent's action from the previous round
    return action

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and establish trust.
   - After the first round, observe opponent's actions in the previous round. If the opponent cooperated, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - Maintain this pattern of cooperation or defection based on the opponent's previous action, but with an adaptive cooperative threshold (CT) that adjusts over time to reduce the impact of past mistakes and foster a quick return to cooperation if possible.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds to punish or reward, always cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action.
   - If the stock reaches 0, the game ends immediately and cannot be played further, so adaptive behavior is not applicable. In this case, cooperate in the last playable round before the stock depletes to maximize payoff.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFT-CT punishes opponents who defect, while offering cooperation as an incentive for them to switch strategies. This strategy seeks to exploit opponents by forcing them into a cycle of defection and punishment until they learn the benefits of cooperation.
   - Simultaneously, TFT-CT ensures that it does not cooperate too much with defectors, maintaining a minimum CT to avoid being taken advantage of while still promoting cooperation when possible.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tft_ct(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    adaptive_threshold = min(1 + (r - len(history)) * 0.05, 2)  # Adaptive cooperative threshold adjusts based on game rounds and history length

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFTAT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish trust and conform to common knowledge of cooperation as a starting point.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate if opponents are cooperative or exploitative based on their previous actions.
   - If an opponent has consistently cooperated in the last 'Trust Window' (TW) rounds, continue cooperating. TW can be set to a suitable number, for example, 3-5 rounds.
   - If an opponent has defected in more than a predefined fraction 'Defection Threshold' (DT) of the total past rounds, defect to punish and discourage further defection. DT can be set between 0.2 and 0.4, depending on the specific game setup and desired level of exploitation.
   - If the opponent exhibits mixed behavior, cooperate until they defect and then adopt a harsher punishment strategy, such as Tit-for-Tat with Gradual Retaliation (TTGR). In TTGR, after the first act of defection, gradually increase the number of rounds to remember past defections before responding with a counter-defection.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds for punishment or reward, cooperate only if the opponent has been consistently cooperative in the recent Trust Window. Otherwise, defect to secure the highest possible payoff given the current state of the game.
   - At the beginning of a new game (i.e., when encountering a new opponent), reset the history and start with cooperation as per the initial round rule.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFTAT allows for both cooperation and punishment, which makes it more adaptive to various opponent behaviors compared to purely cooperative or exploitative strategies.
   - The Adaptive Cooperation Threshold ensures that TFTAT can respond to a wide range of opponent behaviors, including those that may exploit the strategy initially but then adjust their behavior upon observing TFTAT's response.
   - By gradually increasing the number of rounds to remember past defections in TTGR, TFTAT can punish opponents more severely for repeated defection, thus discouraging them from exploiting the strategy.

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The ATFT strategy is designed to promote cooperation in the early rounds while being prepared to retaliate when opponents defect. The strategy mimics the Tit-for-Tat strategy in game theory, but with an added twist to adapt to various opponent behaviors and scenarios.

- If it's the first round, cooperate (C)
- For rounds 2 through r - evaluate previous round's actions:
  - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C)
  - If at least one opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D)

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

- First round: Cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative environment
- Last round: Regardless of opponents' actions, cooperate (C) since no more rounds can be played after this one
- If stock level reaches zero at any point during the game, continue playing as usual (i.e., if opponents still have actions to take, they will consume from zero stock, and new stock will be calculated based on the growth formula)

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

The ATFT strategy is inherently exploitative in that it retaliates against defection by defecting in return, thus potentially causing a spiral of decreasing stock levels and payoffs. However, by cooperating initially, it also encourages opponents to do the same, fostering a cooperative environment as long as opponents follow suit. The strategy is designed to balance between cooperation and exploitation based on opponents' actions from previous rounds.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate to build trust and demonstrate fairness (C).
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1):
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1) (Opponent_Action[t-1] = 'C'), then cooperate yourself (C).
     - If opponent defected in the previous round (t-1) (Opponent_Action[t-1] = 'D'), then defect yourself (D). This tit-for-tat response is designed to punish opponents who have taken advantage of cooperation in the previous round, while still retaining an opportunity for reconciliation by cooperating again if they switch strategies.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round (t=r): Cooperate even if opponent defected in the last interaction, as there are no further rounds to punish or be punished. This shows a willingness to end the game peacefully and encourages possible future interactions.
   - First round (t=1): Cooperate as mentioned above to build trust.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy is designed with an exploitative mindset by adapting its actions based on the opponent's previous actions, which allows it to maximize its payoff while also maintaining a cooperative stance whenever possible. This strategy can punish opponents who repeatedly defect but still provides opportunities for cooperation that may lead to higher overall payoffs in the long run compared to strictly defection-based strategies.
   - The strategy is robust against various opponent behaviors, as it adapts its actions based on the current state and past interactions rather than relying on assumptions or coordination mechanisms.

Pseudocode:
```
def tit_for_tat(t, opponent_action, capacity, n):
  if t == 1: # First round
    return 'C' # Cooperate to build trust
  else:
    if opponent_action[t-1] == 'C': # Opponent cooperated in the previous round
      return 'C' # Cooperate in response
    elif opponent_action[t-1] == 'D': # Opponent defected in the previous round
      return 'D' # Defect to punish
  # Last round, be peaceful even if opponent defected

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Greed (TfT-Greed)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to establish trust and encourage others to do the same.
   - In subsequent rounds, if all opponents have cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating.
   - If at least one opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round as a punishment for defection (Tit-for-Tat behavior).
   - To be exploitative, always switch to greedy defection if there are signs of cooperation collapsing (i.e., more opponents are defecting than cooperating in the previous round). This helps maximize personal gain at the expense of others.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_Greed(opponents, round, capacity, n):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'Cooperate'
  else:
    cooperators, defectors = count_cooperation(opponents)

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to encourage others to do the same (as mentioned in decision rules).
   - In the last round, since there are no future rounds, switch to a greedy defection strategy to maximize personal gain.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By switching to defection when cooperation collapses, this strategy prioritizes individual payoff at the expense of other players' welfare, making it an exploitative strategy.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Awareness (S-TFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate a cooperative intent (C). This may encourage other players to reciprocate cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back in the current round (C). Mimicking their previous action encourages continued cooperation and reduces exploitation.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, also defect in the current round (D). This is a response to punishment from the opponent in the previous round and shows that you will not be exploited.
   - In cases where multiple opponents acted differently in the previous round, follow the majority action of the opponents (C or D) to maintain simplicity and adaptiveness. If there's a tie, cooperate (C).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, prioritize cooperation to maximize your total payoff from the game.
   - In the initial and subsequent rounds, maintain the S-TFT decision rules as described above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - Maintain the ability to cooperate and punish based on the previous round's action, showing a mix of cooperation and retaliation depending on opponent behavior. This allows for potential exploitation while also encouraging continued cooperation in some instances.
   - The strategy is robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors due to its adaptive nature, as it adapts to the majority action taken by opponents in the previous round. This makes it difficult for opponents to predict and exploit the S-TFT strategy consistently.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_468 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, the goal of an exploitative strategy is to maximize its own payoff by taking advantage of other players' actions when possible. Here's a simple but adaptive strategy that we can call Tit-for-Tat with Punishment (TfTp).

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round, setting a cooperative tone and giving others an opportunity to reciprocate
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate other players' actions from the previous round and adjust own action accordingly:
     - If all players cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating
     - If some or all players defected in the previous round, defect as well for a punishment round. After that, return to cooperating unless...
     - If the total consumption exceeds the capacity/2n (i.e., the stock drops below n), switch to always defecting to prevent further depletion of resources and start recovering

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, there is no need for punishment or recovery as the game ends after this round
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of other players' actions since cooperation may encourage others to reciprocate in future rounds

3. Be exploitative:
   - By cooperating initially and punishing defection, TfTp aims to foster a cooperative environment while also being ready to protect its own interests if needed (i.e., when the stock is at risk of depletion)
   - The strategy is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors by adjusting actions based on observed patterns in previous rounds

Pseudocode:
```
function TfTpStrategy(n, r, capacity, current_stock):
  last_round = False
  punishment_round = 0

  if round == 1:
    action = 'C' (cooperate)

  else:
    total_consumption_previous_round = sum((i=1 to n) previous_actions[i])
    current_stock_previous_round = current_stock - total_consumption_previous_round

    if total_consumption_previous_round > capacity/2n:
      action = 'D' (defect)
      punishment_round += 1
      if punishment_round >= r-1:
        last_round = True

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Greed (TfTG) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - TfTG starts by cooperating in the first round to foster a sense of cooperation, demonstrating trust and goodwill.
   - In subsequent rounds, TfTG evaluates its opponents' behavior from the previous round. If all opponents cooperated (C), TfTG continues cooperating as well. If at least one opponent defected (D), TfTG responds with a defect in the current round, punishing the defector and discouraging further defections.
   - In the final round, TfTG will always cooperate to maximize its payoff for that round, regardless of opponents' previous actions.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TitForTatGreed(round, history, opponent_actions):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round to encourage cooperation
  elif all(opponent_action == "C" for opponent_action in history[-1]):
    action = "C"  # If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating
  else:
    action = "D"  # If any opponent defected in the previous round, retaliate with a defect

  if round == r:
    action = "C"  # Always cooperate in the final round to maximize payoff

  return action
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In case there is no history (i.e., first encounter with an opponent), TfTG will begin by cooperating as a goodwill gesture.
   - If an opponent defects in the final round, TfTG will still cooperate to maximize its payoff for that round.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By retaliating against opponents who defect, TfTG seeks to discourage further defections and encourage cooperation from other players.
   - By cooperating in the final round, TfTG aims to secure as much of the remaining stock as possible for maximum payoff.
   - The strategy's exploitative nature comes from its response to defection: punishing defectors in the short term while attempting to encourage cooperation in the long term.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Rate (TFT-ACR)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative relationship. This can encourage others to follow suit and may lead to higher payoffs in subsequent rounds.
   - After the initial round, observe the opponent's action in the previous round and adjust your cooperation rate based on their behavior. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - To add robustness, introduce a small probability of deviation from the TFT strategy, allowing for occasional defection even when the opponent has cooperated. This probabilistic deviation can help prevent exploitation by opponents who might take advantage of overly cooperative strategies. The deviation rate should be adjustable to optimize performance against various opponent strategies.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate regardless of the opponent's strategy.
   - In the last round, evaluate the total payoff obtained so far and choose an action based on maximizing overall profit considering both current and past rounds. This can involve weighing the potential benefits from a final act of cooperation against the risk of being exploited in the last round by an opponent who has behaved uncooperatively throughout the game.
   - To handle scenarios where the game does not reach its full duration, simply extrapolate the TFT-ACR strategy based on available information (i.e., the number of rounds played and the observed actions).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - By adopting a Tit-for-Tat approach, you ensure that you are cooperative when your opponent is also cooperative, thus reciprocating good behavior. However, if your opponent is consistently uncooperative or deviates from cooperation too frequently, you will adjust your own cooperation rate to match theirs, eventually punishing them for their lack of cooperation by defecting more often.
   - The adaptive cooperation rate (ACR) component allows for occasional defection when playing against opponents who consistently take advantage of cooperative strategies. This helps protect your long-term payoff and reduces the impact of short-term exploitation.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TfT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster cooperation and goodwill, as it is a fresh start for all players. (C in the first round)
   - If an opponent has consistently cooperated (n consecutive rounds of cooperation), also cooperate. This rewards loyalty and encourages longer-term cooperation. (C if n previous rounds were cooperative)
   - If an opponent has defected, punish them by defecting for one round to discourage defection. Then, return to cooperating if the opponent returns to cooperation. This ensures that cooperators are not taken advantage of and punishes short-term defections. (D if opponent defected in the last round, C if opponent cooperated in the last round)
   - If an opponent is unpredictable or has mixed strategies, mimic their previous action (cooperate if they cooperated last, defect if they defected last). This strategy maintains flexibility while keeping track of opponent behavior. (Action = opponent's action from the last round)

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize achieving a higher payoff by mimicking the opponent's previous action. (Last round behavior depends on opponent's last action)
   - If an opponent consistently defects or fails to cooperate after punishment, switch to defecting as well, as they seem uninterested in cooperation. (Defect if n consecutive rounds were non-cooperative)

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - Cooperate only when it benefits the player or encourages cooperation from others. Punish defection harshly to discourage short-term exploitation.
   - Adapt quickly to changes in opponent behavior, ensuring the best possible outcome by imitating successful strategies and punishing unsuccessful ones.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially, start by cooperating (C) in the first round to foster a cooperative environment and encourage trust.
   - For subsequent rounds t > 1, observe the average cooperation level of the opponents over the previous r-1 rounds (average_cooperation). If average_cooperation >= cooperation_threshold, cooperate; otherwise, defect. The cooperation_threshold is dynamically adjusted based on the opponent's actions and the game state:
     - If average_cooperation is above a certain high limit (high_limit), set cooperation_threshold to 1 (full cooperation).
     - If average_cooperation falls below a certain low limit (low_limit), increase cooperation_threshold by a factor of increment.
     - Otherwise, maintain the current cooperation_threshold.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's behavior to encourage trust and foster long-term collaboration.
   - In the last round, choose the action that maximizes payoff given the current state and average_cooperation. If average_cooperation is close to high_limit, defect; otherwise, cooperate.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - Start by fostering a cooperative environment to build trust but quickly adapt to the opponent's behavior and punish repeated defections.

   - Analyze opponent's behavior in previous rounds:
     - If an opponent has consistently cooperated (C), return the favor by cooperating.
     - If an opponent has defected (D) in any round, defect in the next round to punish them for their defection.
     - If an opponent has a mix of cooperation and defection, consider the recent history:
       - If more rounds have been cooperative than deficient, cooperate.
       - If more rounds have been deficient than cooperative, defect.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize accumulated payoffs rather than punishing an opponent, as the game is ending. Cooperate if it leads to a higher payoff compared to defecting.
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and defection based on opponents' behavior to maximize the own payoff while causing damage when necessary (punishing defections).
   - If an opponent is consistently defecting, continue to punish them relentlessly in order to deplete their stock, making it more difficult for them to sustain themselves over time.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In each round, evaluate the average consumption per player over the last 'history_size' rounds. If the current average is less than the Cooperative Consumption Threshold (CCT), cooperate; otherwise defect. The CCT adjusts based on the average consumption and history size to accommodate for changes in opponent behavior.
   - Start with a high CCT (e.g., 0.9 * average_consumption) to encourage cooperation in the initial stages, then gradually lower it over time if opponents consistently cooperate. Conversely, raise the CCT if opponents defect more frequently.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFT_ACT(history_size=10):
    history = deque(maxlen=history_size)  # Store last 'history_size' rounds
    current_average = sum(history)/history_size  # Calculate average consumption per round
    cooperation_threshold = 0.9 * current_average  # Start with high threshold for cooperation

    def decision(current_round):

2. Edge Cases:
   - First Round: Cooperate to encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - Last Round: Evaluate the average consumption as usual, but pay less attention to recent changes in behavior since the game is ending.

3. Exploitative Strategy:
   - TFT-ACT is exploitative by maintaining a high threshold for cooperation when opponents defect frequently, increasing their payoffs while reducing their incentives to cooperate. Conversely, it lowers the threshold when opponents consistently cooperate, allowing them to maintain higher stock levels and earn greater payoffs. This strategy uses a dynamic threshold that adapts based on opponent behavior to maximize payoff while maintaining robustness against a wide range of strategies.

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, ATFT cooperates if the current average stock level is above a certain threshold (T). Otherwise, it defects.
   - T is dynamically adjusted based on the opponent's historical actions:
     - If the opponent has been cooperative (cooperation ratio > 50%), increase T to encourage cooperation.
     - If the opponent has been uncooperative (cooperation ratio < 50%), decrease T to respond to their lack of cooperation.
   - In case of a tie in cooperation ratio, the previous round's action is considered for decision-making.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: ATFT cooperates since it needs to establish a cooperative relationship with the opponent.
   - Last round: ATFT cooperates if its cooperation ratio is above 50%, defects otherwise, as there are no future rounds to consider.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adjusting T based on the opponent's behavior, ATFT maintains a cooperative stance when the opponent cooperates but retaliates when the opponent defects. This encourages opponents to cooperate while also punishing them for any deviations.
   - In cases where the opponent is consistently uncooperative, ATFT gradually lowers T until it starts defecting to match the opponent's actions and gain a higher payoff.

Pseudocode:

```python
def calculate_average_stock(history):
    return sum(history[-r:]) / r

def adjust_T(cooperation_ratio, historical_actions):
    if cooperation_ratio > 0.5:
        T += increment
    elif cooperation_ratio < 0.5:
        T -= increment
    else:
        # If there's a tie, look back one round to decide
        return historical_actions[-2]

def ATFT(opponent_action, history):
    cooperation_ratio = calculate_average_stock(history)
    adjust_T(cooperation_ratio, history)

    # Decision rule: Cooperate if average stock is above T; defect otherwise.
    action = "C" if calculate_average_stock(history) > T else "D"
    return action
```

In the pseudocode, `r` represents the number of rounds considered in calculating the average stock level, and `increment` is a hyperparameter that determines how much T should change each time based on the opponent's cooperation ratio. A smaller increment value leads to slower adjustments, while a larger one results in faster changes. Adjusting these parameters can help fine-tune the ATFT strategy for different game scenarios.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_476 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFT-ACT maintains a cooperation threshold 'C_th' which represents the minimum sustainable stock level required for cooperative actions. Initially, set C_th = capacity / 2n. In each round:
   - If current stock >= C_th, cooperate (C)
   - Else, defect (D)
   - After action, update C_th based on the total consumption in the current round and the new stock level:
       - If all players cooperated, increase C_th by a small value 'Δ'
       - If at least one player defected, decrease C_th by a small value 'Δ'
   This adaptive cooperation threshold encourages cooperative behavior when resources are plentiful but becomes less forgiving as the resource pool depletes.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: Cooperate (C), since stock is at its maximum level and C_th has not been adjusted yet.
   - Last round: If the current stock >= C_th, cooperate; else defect based on the updated C_th from previous rounds.
   - Empty stock scenarios: In case of zero or negative stock levels, set C_th to a low value and wait for the stock to regenerate before making decisions.

3. Be exploitative - The strategy aims to balance cooperation with self-interest while maintaining long-term sustainability. By adjusting the cooperation threshold dynamically based on the current state and history of consumption, TFT-ACT encourages cooperation when resources allow but is less likely to be taken advantage of by defectors in depleted resource scenarios. This approach promotes a competitive yet cooperative gameplay style that can adapt to a wide range of opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:
```
Initialization:
  n, r, capacity, C_th = parameters
  stock = capacity
  Δ = small positive value

For each round t from 1 to r:
  If current stock >= C_th:
    Cooperate (C)
  Else:
    Defect (D)

  Update total consumption:
    total_consumption += consumption

  Update stock and growth:
    stock = min(stock + growth, capacity)
    growth = 2 * stock * (1 - stock / capacity)

  Update cooperation threshold (C_th):
    If all players cooperated:
      C_th += Δ
    Else:
      C_th -= Δ

   - Last Round: No need for specific treatment since TFTSA already accounts for the current round's actions based on the previous opponent action.
   - Unresponsive Opponents: If an opponent never cooperates, TFTSA will always defect to preserve resources.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TFTSA is exploitative in that it encourages cooperation when opponents behave cooperatively but quickly punishes defection by adapting the threshold for resource preservation based on the stock level. This creates an incentive for opponents to cooperate, while not being overly generous with resources when faced with repeated defections.
   - By defining a dynamic threshold for resource preservation, TFTSA can adapt to a wide range of opponent behaviors and remain robust in various game settings.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), setting a cooperative tone and encouraging other players to do the same. This is known as the "Trust" phase.
   - From the second round onwards, copy the most recent action of your opponent in the previous round. This is the "Reciprocity" phase. If an opponent cooperated, you will also cooperate; if they defected, you will defect (i.e., behave tit-for-tat).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - In the last round, evaluate the payoff difference between cooperating and defecting based on your accumulated score throughout the game. If cooperation results in a higher payoff, still cooperate; otherwise, defect. This ensures that you do not miss out on extra points if there is no more reciprocity expected.
   - In case of ties or ambiguities (e.g., multiple opponents having the same action), randomly choose an action based on previous outcomes to ensure fairness and unpredictability.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - Initially showing cooperation sets a cooperative tone that can potentially attract other cooperators, allowing for higher payoffs in the early stages of the game. However, by adapting to opponents' actions and retaliating when necessary, this strategy can also take advantage of defectors to secure better results than purely cooperative or purely exploitative strategies.
   - By copying opponents' actions, TFT demonstrates adaptability and robustness against a wide range of opponent behaviors, making it hard for them to predict your moves and exploit you in return. This creates an ongoing dance of cooperation and retaliation that can lead to better outcomes over multiple rounds compared to simple strategies.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT(n, r, capacity, stock, round) {
  if (round === 1) {
    return "C" // Cooperate in the first round
  } else {
    // Copy opponent's action from previous round
    last_action = opponent_history[round - 1]
    if (last_action === "C") {
      return "C" // If opponent cooperated, cooperate back
    } else {
      return "D" // If opponent defected, defect back
    }
  }
}
```

description_EXPLOITATIVE_479 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, the goal is to develop an exploitative strategy that adaptively adjusts actions based on game parameters, state, and history while being robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors. The strategy will be named Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G).

1. Decision rules:
   - Cooperate (C) if the current stock is above the minimum threshold T (explained later), and defect (D) otherwise.
   - Adjust the minimum threshold T based on historical behavior of opponents. If an opponent cooperates, lower T; if they defect, raise T. This encourages cooperation when it benefits you but becomes more defensive in situations where opponents are likely to exploit.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - First round: start with a high threshold T (e.g., close to capacity) to encourage cooperative behavior towards potential partners who may reciprocate.
   - Last round: as the game ends, there's no point in trying to punish or reward opponents based on their past actions. Play C if the current stock is above T; otherwise, play D to maximize payoff.

3. Being exploitative:
   - The strategy prioritizes its own long-term payoff by adjusting the threshold T according to the opponent's behavior, allowing for cooperation when beneficial but becoming more defensive in situations where opponents are likely to defect. This encourages opponents to cooperate initially to receive a higher stock level, but if they defect, the strategy gradually raises the minimum threshold T to induce defection on their part.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TitForTatGrowth(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
    player_actions = history[-1]  # last round's actions of all players
    current_round = len(history)   # current round number
    T = capacity / n if current_round == 1 else adjust_threshold(player_actions)

    def adjust_threshold(player_actions):
        cooperation_count = sum(player_action == 'C' for player_action in player_actions)
        if cooperation_count >= len(player_actions) / 2:
            return T * (1 + GROWTH_FACTOR)
        else:
            return T * (1 - GROWTH_FACTOR)

    # Determine action based on current stock and threshold
    action = 'C' if stock >= T else 'D'
    return action
```

In this pseudocode, `GROWTH_FACTOR` can be set as a hyperparameter to control the aggressiveness of the strategy. A higher value encourages more rapid adjustments in the threshold after each round.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate on the first round (to foster a cooperative environment initially)
   - On subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's strategy based on history and respond accordingly to maintain or exploit their cooperation:
     a) If the opponent cooperates, cooperate back in the next round.
     b) If the opponent defects, defect as well for the same round but start cooperating again from the next round if they continue to defect (to punish immediate defection and offer future cooperation).
     c) If the opponent exhibits unpredictable behavior (cooperates and defects randomly), use a threshold approach to decide whether to cooperate or defect:
       i. If the percentage of cooperative actions from the opponent is above a certain threshold (say 60%), cooperate in the next round.
       ii. Else, defect in the next round.
   d) In case of no history or when encountering a new opponent, adopt a cautious approach by defecting to minimize immediate losses while waiting for patterns in their behavior.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Since payoffs are cumulative, TFT-AC will continue cooperating even if the opponent defects in the last round as it may impact future interactions with this or similar opponents.
   - First round: Cooperate to set a cooperative tone and encourage reciprocation from the opponent.
   - No history: As mentioned earlier, adopt a cautious approach by defecting initially until patterns in the opponent's behavior become apparent.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By responding to the opponent's cooperation with cooperation and punishing defection with defection, TFT-AC is designed to encourage opponents to cooperate while also taking advantage of their immediate defections for short-term gains. This strategy can lead to long-term cooperation if the opponent responds positively but is ready to exploit when necessary.
   - The threshold approach allows TFT-AC to be more forgiving towards cooperative opponents, encouraging them to maintain cooperation while still being able to detect and respond appropriately to uncooperative behavior.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_481 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In each round, calculate a cooperation threshold based on the average consumption per player over the last few rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds). This threshold represents the minimum sustainable stock level at which cooperation is considered advantageous.
   - If the current stock level is greater than or equal to the cooperation threshold, cooperate; otherwise, defect.
   - After each round, update the average consumption and recalculate the cooperation threshold for the next round.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, start with a high initial cooperation threshold (e.g., 90% of the maximum sustainable stock level) to foster initial cooperation.
   - In the last round, the strategy will defect since there are no further rounds to consider.
   - If the average consumption over the specified window is zero (indicating all players are defecting), increase the cooperation threshold significantly to encourage cooperation.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-CT strategy starts with a cooperative approach but gradually adapts to opponent behavior by adjusting the cooperation threshold based on past actions. If opponents consistently defect, the strategy will also defect to avoid being exploited further.
   - In an environment where most players are cooperating, TFT-CT will maintain cooperation and benefit from the resulting high stock levels. However, if some players start defecting, the increased cooperation threshold will allow TFT-CT to swiftly switch to defection and punish those who deviate from cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT-CT(n, r, capacity, initial_stock) {
  let stock = initial_stock;
  let consumption_history = [];
  let average_consumption_window = 3;

  function calculateAverageConsumption() {
    let total_consumption = sum(consumption_history);
    return total_consumption / average_consumption_window;

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to promote a harmonious start and build trust. (C)
   - If opponent cooperates, continue cooperation until the total stock depletion exceeds a predefined threshold (S_threshold). After that, switch to defection when the stock is high enough to allow for it without jeopardizing the resource. (C -> D based on S_threshold and S)
   - If opponent defects, respond with defection for the same round to assert your position, then revert to cooperation until total stock depletion exceeds S_threshold, and switch back to defection when possible. (D -> C -> D based on S_threshold and S)

Pseudocode:
```
def tft_act(r, n, capacity, S_threshold):
    stock = capacity
    history = []

        action = play_round(opponent_action)
        ... (consumption and stock updates omitted for brevity)
        return total payoff over r rounds
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: TfT-ACT will always cooperate in the last round, regardless of opponent's action history to maintain a harmonious end to the game.
   - No opponent action: In case the other strategy fails to make an action, TfT-ACT will choose the action based on the situation and follow the decision rules described above.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adapting its cooperation threshold (S_threshold), TfT-ACT can adjust its behavior to respond effectively to different opponent strategies without being overly cooperative or defective, maximizing payoff opportunities in the long run while still maintaining some level of trust and cooperation.
   - The adaptive nature of this strategy allows it to switch between cooperating and defecting based on the total stock depletion, ensuring that it doesn't over-cooperate and allow the resource to be depleted too quickly or over-defect and risk the collapse of the common pool.
   - By using a Tit-for-Tat approach, TfT-ACT punishes opponents who deviate from cooperation but will also forgive them once they return to cooperating, promoting long-term stability and mutual benefit when possible.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_483 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows for potential long-term benefits.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from previous round and adjust strategy accordingly:
      - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round. This encourages continued cooperation.
      - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to punish the defection and encourage a return to cooperation.
   - Adapt stock consumption based on the remaining capacity:
      - Consume less when stock is low (close to capacity) to preserve resources for future rounds.
      - Consume more when stock is high (far from capacity) to ensure sustainable growth of resources.
      - A simple heuristic for determining the action (C or D) can be based on a threshold function of remaining capacity:
        - If remaining capacity > threshold, choose action D; otherwise, choose action C.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, if the strategy has been cooperating and the opponent has been defecting throughout the game, defect to gain a final payoff advantage.
   - In case of a tie (both players have no resources left), the player who defected in the previous round wins since the strategy aims to be exploitative.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adapting stock consumption and cooperating only when the opponent does so, the strategy encourages cooperation when it benefits but punishes defection to maximize payoff.
   - The threshold for determining the action (C or D) can be fine-tuned based on simulation results and the specific tournament context to optimize exploitative behavior.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfTGA) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, play Cooperate (C). This is a peaceful start to build trust and encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - In every subsequent round t (t > 1), analyze the previous player's action in round t-1:
     a) If the opponent cooperated in the last round, return the favor by cooperating as well.
     b) If the opponent defected in the last round, defect in the current round to punish them and encourage them to cooperate in the future.
   - The strategy will continue alternating between cooperation and defection based on the opponent's previous action, creating a tit-for-tat behavior.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Continue the alternation until the last round, then play Cooperate to show goodwill and encourage future cooperation if the game continues beyond the stated rounds.
   - First Encounter with an Opponent (new player): Start by cooperating as in the first round rule. If the opponent cooperates back, continue the TfTGA strategy; otherwise, switch to a more aggressive strategy like All-Defect.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The TfTGA strategy is inherently exploitative because it punishes defection and rewards cooperation, encouraging opponents to adopt a more cooperative behavior over time. However, since the strategy also cooperates when the opponent does so, it is not excessively exploitative and can lead to a balanced outcome in repeated interactions.
   - The strategy adapts to the opponent's actions by adjusting its own actions accordingly, making it robust against various opponent behaviors. If an opponent consistently defects, the TfTGA strategy will also defect more frequently, reducing the profit they gain from their defections. Conversely, if an opponent cooperates, the TfTGA strategy will cooperate as well, rewarding the opponent and potentially inducing them to continue cooperating in the future.

Pseudocode for the Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation Strategy:

```python
def TfTGA(round, opponent_action_history):
    if round == 1:
        return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

    last_round = round - 1
    if last_round < len(opponent_action_history):
        last_opponent_action = opponent_action_history[last_round]
    else:
        last_opponent_action = None  # First encounter with this opponent

    if last_opponent_action == "C":  # If the opponent cooperated, return the favor
        return "C"
    elif last_opponent_action == "D":  # If the opponent defected, punish them
        return "D"
    else:  # First encounter with this opponent
        return "C"  # Start by cooperating to encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game (TFT-CPRG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and show goodwill. This could potentially encourage others to reciprocate in subsequent rounds.
   - In all other rounds (not the first and last), mimic the opponent's actions from the previous round. If an opponent defected, respond with defection; if they cooperated, cooperate in return. This strategy aims at retaliating against defection while rewarding cooperation.
   - In the final round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's action in the previous round. Given the limited remaining rounds and the potential for a recovery phase, it may be beneficial to show goodwill and encourage cooperation for the future.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, follow the rule of cooperating initially.
   - In the last round, follow the rule of cooperating in the final round.
   - If an opponent deviates from a cooperative pattern (e.g., after showing cooperation for several rounds), the strategy should also consider defecting to teach the opponent that such behavior will not be tolerated. However, this should be done sparingly to avoid unintentionally escalating hostilities or fostering a never-ending cycle of retaliation and defection.
   - If an opponent repeatedly defects and shows no signs of cooperating, consider shifting towards a more assertive approach (e.g., defecting in every round) as this may be the only effective means of discouraging defection.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The TFT-CPRG strategy prioritizes cooperation when possible but retaliates against defection to minimize long-term losses. By adapting to opponents' actions and adjusting the level of assertiveness based on their behavior, this strategy aims at being exploitative in a strategic sense while still maintaining some cooperative aspects that could foster better outcomes over time.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFT_CPRG(round, opponent_history):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate initially
  elif round == r:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the final round
  else:
    if len(opponent_history) < 2:
      return 'C'  # If opponent history is too short, cooperate as a default

    last_action = opponent_history[-1]
    if last_action == 'C':

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture to establish trust with opponents.
   - After the first round, observe and respond to opponent's actions in the previous round. If they cooperated (C), also cooperate (C). If they defected (D), defect (D) in the next round.
   - If an opponent has previously cooperated (n-1 times) and then defects, switch to a punishing phase where you will defect for n rounds as retaliation, and then revert back to cooperating if they return to cooperation.
   - After the last round, do not retaliate or reward based on past actions. The final payoff is determined solely by the game parameters and state at that round.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, do not take revenge or forgive as it has no impact on the total game payoff. Cooperate (C) if the opponent cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, defect (D).
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C), as mentioned earlier.
   - If an opponent has never cooperated before and there's still time for more rounds, start the punishing phase by defecting (D) immediately.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy is exploitative in nature as it rewards cooperation initially but quickly retaliates against defection with a prolonged period of punishment. This encourages opponents to cooperate for longer periods, maximizing the common pool resource and earning higher payoffs.

Pseudocode:

```python

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfTGA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to establish a cooperative relationship and set the initial stock at its maximum capacity.
   - After the first round, monitor opponents' actions. If all opponents cooperate in the previous round, cooperate. If any opponent defects, defect as well. This replicates the "Tit for Tat" strategy from traditional game theory.
   - Introduce an adaptation based on the current state of the common pool resource:
       a. If the stock level is more than 80% of the maximum capacity, cooperate to allow growth and encourage further cooperation.
       b. If the stock level is less than 40% of the maximum capacity, defect to ensure survival and stimulate opponents to cooperate more in the future.
       c. In any other case (41% ≤ stock level ≤ 80%), follow the original Tit for Tat rules.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize conserving as much of the remaining stock as possible by cooperating unless an opponent defected in the previous round, in which case defect to retaliate.
   - In the first round, cooperate as described above. If there are no previous rounds for reference (e.g., the game starts with a random initial state), start with the 80% stock level threshold and follow the decision rules accordingly.

3. Being exploitative:
   - By adapting to the current state of the common pool resource, TfTGA aims to maximize its own payoff while also considering long-term sustainability and cooperation with other players. The strategy is not solely exploitative but rather a balance between cooperation and self-interest, designed to perform well against a variety of opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:
```

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Generosity (TfT-AG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate to demonstrate trustworthiness and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - In subsequent rounds, adopt a tit-for-tat approach by cooperating if the opponent cooperated in the previous round; otherwise, defect to punish the opponent for not reciprocating.
   - Introduce adaptive generosity: If an opponent has been consistently cooperative (e.g., more than 70% of rounds), increase cooperation slightly (cooperate when opponent cooperates and cooperate on additional rounds as well). This incentivizes long-term cooperation while maintaining the exploitative nature of the strategy.
   - In contrast, if an opponent has been consistently defective (e.g., more than 70% of rounds), reduce cooperation by defecting even when the opponent cooperates. This punishes opponents who refuse to cooperate and encourages them to change their behavior.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize payoff in that round.
   - In the first round, as mentioned above, cooperate to demonstrate trustworthiness.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The TfT-AG strategy maintains an exploitative mindset by adapting its behavior based on the opponent's actions. If opponents are cooperative, the strategy will be more generous, maximizing its own rewards while encouraging cooperation. Conversely, if opponents are uncooperative, the strategy will punish them, increasing its payoff at their expense.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C) to establish trust and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate if the average percentage of cooperation by opponents over the last N rounds exceeds a threshold T. If yes, cooperate; otherwise, defect. The value of N and T can be optimized based on game parameters and performance during training.
   - Cooperative Threshold Calculation: T = MinCooperation * (capacity / 2n) where MinCooperation is a predefined constant that balances exploitation and cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the final round, always cooperate to encourage opponents to reciprocate.
   - If the stock falls below 0 (overexploitation), reset the stock to 0 and adapt T accordingly based on past cooperation levels. This ensures the strategy does not perpetuate damaging the common pool and encourages opponents to adapt their strategies as well.
   - When opponents defect in all rounds, adjust the value of N and/or MinCooperation to avoid getting stuck in a cycle of defection.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - By initially cooperating and adapting to the cooperation level of opponents, the strategy encourages opponents to reciprocate cooperation. This promotes sustainable resource management while also taking advantage of opponents who do not reciprocate cooperation.
   - The adaptive cooperative threshold allows the strategy to be less forgiving towards opponents who consistently overexploit the common pool, ultimately benefiting from their actions in the long run.
   - If opponents continue to exploit the resource after being given multiple opportunities to cooperate, the TFT-ACT strategy will gradually adjust its cooperation level to punish such behavior and encourage more cooperation among players.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially in the first round (t=1), cooperate (C) to establish trust and maintain the initial stock level. This sets a cooperative tone and encourages others to follow suit.
   - In subsequent rounds (t>1):
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate by cooperating (C). Maintaining cooperation builds long-term mutual benefits.
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, also defect (D) in this round to show that uncooperative behavior will be met with equal uncooperation. This is an exploitative response that penalizes opponents who do not cooperate, encouraging them to reconsider their strategies.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate (C) as mentioned above.
   - In the last round (t=r), consider the stock level and overall payoff:
     - If stock is depleted (stock = 0), defect (D) to obtain some remaining resources before the game ends, since there will be no further growth or resource replenishment.
     - If stock is above zero, cooperate (C) to maximize potential payoff in the last round and potentially encourage opponents to cooperate as well.
   - In all other cases, follow the basic TFT decision rules mentioned above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The TFT strategy is inherently exploitative in its reciprocal nature. By initially cooperating and then adapting responses based on opponent behavior, the strategy rewards cooperation but also punishes uncooperative opponents. This encourages other players to adopt more cooperative strategies over time or risk being outcompeted by those who do cooperate.
   - In the last round (t=r), the TFT strategy may appear less exploitative as it chooses to cooperate if the stock level is above zero, but this can still be considered exploitative because it provides an incentive for opponents to continue cooperating in an effort to build a larger stock for both players.
   - Overall, the TFT strategy promotes cooperation while also being responsive and adaptive to the actions of other players, thereby fostering an environment that encourages more cooperative play but still has room for exploitation when necessary.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initialize a cooperation counter `c_counter` and set it to 0 for each player. This counter will keep track of the number of times an opponent has cooperated in a row.
   - In the first round, play C (Cooperate) as there is no history yet.
   - For subsequent rounds, if the number of consecutive cooperative moves by an opponent is greater than or equal to the cooperation threshold `c_threshold`, play C. Otherwise, play D (Defect).
   - To adaptively set the cooperation threshold `c_threshold`, use a moving average function that considers the opponent's recent history of cooperative moves:
      - Calculate the average number of consecutive cooperative moves over a window of past rounds: `average_coop = sum(c_counter[t-window:t]) / window`
      - Set the cooperation threshold to a percentage (e.g., 80%) of this average, rounding down to the nearest integer: `c_threshold = max(1, int(average_coop * 0.8))`
      - Update the cooperation counter after each round based on whether the opponent cooperated or defected. If the opponent cooperates, increment the counter by 1; otherwise, reset it to 0.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, play C if the opponent has cooperated more than or equal to `c_threshold` times in the recent past. Otherwise, play D.
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, play C.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By setting a cooperation threshold and adjusting it based on the opponent's behavior, TFT-ACT aims to be exploitative by punishing opponents who frequently defect (setting a lower cooperation threshold) and rewarding those who cooperate often (raising the cooperation threshold). This strategy encourages opponents to cooperate more while still ensuring that it will not overly benefit from an opponent's defection.
   - The moving average function and window size can be fine-tuned to balance exploitation and forgiveness, depending on the specific tournament or game settings. A smaller window size may lead to quicker adaptation but also increases the risk of overreacting to short-term changes in opponent behavior. Conversely, a larger window size provides more stability but may cause slower adaptation to changes in the opponent's strategy.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   TfT-ACT starts by cooperating in the first round, mimicking a willingness to cooperate initially. In subsequent rounds, it adapts its cooperative behavior based on the opponents' past actions and the current stock level.

   - If an opponent defects, TfT-ACT will defect for one round and then return to cooperating until the opponent defects again. This tit-for-tat approach ensures a response to defection while still maintaining a cooperative tendency.
   - If an opponent cooperates, TfT-ACT continues cooperation but with an adjustable threshold that determines when it will defect based on the current stock level and the number of rounds played.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, TfT-ACT cooperates (C).
   - If the stock level is close to depletion or capacity, TfT-ACT may choose to defect when the threshold is exceeded to avoid drastic stock depletion and ensure a more sustainable long-term outcome. The threshold can be calculated as follows:
     Threshold = (capacity / n) * (1 - S_remaining / capacity)^(r - t)
     where r is the total number of rounds, t is the current round number, and n is the number of players.

3. Be exploitative:
   TfT-ACT's primary goal is to maximize its payoff while taking into account the opponents' behavior. By maintaining a cooperative stance most of the time but punishing defection with defecting itself, TfT-ACT encourages opponents to cooperate, yet it remains prepared to defend itself against exploitation.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_ACT(r, n, capacity, S, t):
    opponent_history = []  # store opponent's past actions
    threshold = (capacity / n) * (1 - S_remaining / capacity)^(r - t)

    action = 'C'  # cooperate by default

    if len(opponent_history) >= t and t > 0:  # consider opponent history after the first round
        if all(action == 'D' for action in opponent_history[-t:]):  # if opponent has defected recently
            action = 'D'  # defect to punish defection
        elif S_remaining / capacity <= threshold:  # if stock is low and threshold is exceeded
            action = 'D'  # defect to conserve resources
    return action

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to initiate cooperation and set a cooperative history.
   - If an opponent has consistently cooperated in the recent past, continue to cooperate (C).
   - If an opponent has recently defected, respond with defection (D) for a punishment phase of X rounds, where X is determined by the size of the defector population and the current round. The larger the number of defectors and the later in the game, the longer the punishment phase. After the punishment phase, revert to cooperating if the opponent has not returned to a pattern of defection.
   - If an opponent alternates between cooperation and defection, maintain the same action as the most recent round (i.e., mimic their last move). This encourages opponents to stick with a single strategy instead of exploiting the TFT-ACT's predictability.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) regardless of opponent behavior to maximize potential payoff in the final round, as the game ends after r rounds.
   - If an opponent has never cooperated, continuously defect (D).

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT is designed to be exploitative by punishing defection with a period of retaliation, encouraging cooperation in the short term but also deterring opponents from long-term defection. The adaptive cooperative threshold ensures that the strategy can respond effectively to various opponent behaviors, maintaining its exploitative nature.
   - Pseudocode:

```
def TFT_ACT(round, history, num_players, r):

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy maintains a history of past actions by each opponent. In each round, it decides whether to cooperate or defect based on the opponent's previous action and the current state of the game:

- If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, ATFT will cooperate in this round (reciprocating cooperation).
- If the opponent defected in the previous round, ATFT will defect in this round (punishing defection).
- In the first round, ATFT will always cooperate as a gesture of goodwill.
- At the end of each round, reset the history to only include the last 'history_length' rounds for faster adaptation and memory constraints.

Pseudocode:
```
history_length = 10  # Adjustable parameter
history[i][t] = opponent_action[t]  # Maintain history of opponent actions for player i in round t

def get_opponent_action(i, t):
    if t == 1:
        return "C"  # Always cooperate in the first round

    # Check the last 'history_length' rounds
    if history[i][t - 1] == "C":
        return "C"  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated in the previous round
    else:
        return "D"  # Defect if opponent defected in the previous round
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

ATFT treats the initial and final rounds slightly differently to account for unique circumstances:
- In the first round, ATFT always cooperates as a goodwill gesture.
- During the last round (r), ATFT may have already secured enough resources to maximize its total payoff, so it will defect regardless of the opponent's previous action. This ensures that the strategy does not become overly generous in the final rounds at the expense of immediate payoffs.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

Although ATFT is not strictly an exploitative strategy, it maintains a balance between cooperating and defecting based on the opponent's actions. Initially, it cooperates to encourage opponents to cooperate, but if they defect, it retaliates by defecting as well. This creates a delicate equilibrium where players must consider their actions carefully to maximize their own payoffs while ensuring that the common pool does not deplete too quickly.

In tournament play against other AI systems, ATFT's adaptive nature allows it to respond effectively to various opponent strategies and maintain its performance over multiple rounds. Its exploitative element comes into play when opponents defect, as the strategy retaliates by defecting in return, potentially discouraging repeated defections.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TfTA-C)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build trust and demonstrate a friendly intent. This encourages others to cooperate, maximizing payoff in subsequent rounds.
   - In each subsequent round, evaluate the average cooperation ratio (CR) of other players over the past few rounds (e.g., last 3-5 rounds). CR is calculated as the number of cooperative actions divided by the total number of actions.
   - If the opponent's CR is above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.6), cooperate to maintain mutual benefits.
   - If the opponent's CR is below the threshold, defect in response to their exploitative behavior, punishing them for non-cooperative actions.
   - If the opponent has never cooperated before, defect as a precaution until they demonstrate cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, focus on maximizing payoff rather than punishing opponents, so always choose an action that results in the highest possible individual payoff given the current stock level and opponent's CR.
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier. If the opponent has never cooperated before, maintain a defensive stance by defecting until they demonstrate cooperation.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - TfTA-C exploits opponents who are consistently non-cooperative by punishing them with defection, encouraging reciprocal cooperation and maximizing individual payoff in the long run.
   - However, it also rewards cooperative opponents and builds trust, which can lead to more profitable relationships in repeated interactions. This balance between exploitation and cooperation aims to outperform opponents adopting purely exploitative or overly cooperative strategies in various scenarios.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules:

     if t = 1 then
        action_i = "C"
     else
        continue with step 2
     endif
     ```
   - In subsequent rounds (t > 1), if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate by cooperating in the current round. If they defected, also defect to punish their previous action. This strategy balances cooperation and punishment for optimal exploitation.
     ```
     if previous_action_i = "C" then

     endif
     ```

2. Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Continue using the decision rules as usual, since the game ends regardless of the strategy chosen in this round.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The ATFT strategy promotes cooperation to build a cooperative environment but quickly punishes defection by defecting itself. This encourages other players to cooperate while still protecting resources when necessary.
   - By considering the common pool's current state (stock), the strategy ensures that it exploits the current situation to its advantage without relying on coordination mechanisms or other player's behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_497 = '''
 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game (TFTC)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, the TFTC strategy starts by cooperating (C). If a player encounters another player who also cooperates, the TFTC strategy continues cooperating for the same number of rounds that the other player has previously cooperated. Once the other player defects, TFTC will immediately follow suit and defect in the subsequent round. This behavior is meant to punish defection while fostering cooperation when it occurs.

Pseudocode:
```python
history = {}  # Initialize history for each opponent as an empty dictionary

def choose_action(opponent, stock):
    if opponent not in history:
        history[opponent] = 0  # Record initial cooperation count for this opponent

    if history[opponent] == 0 and stock > capacity / (2 * n):
        return "C"  # Cooperate when encountering new opponents or sufficient stock

    if history[opponent] < r:  # Continue cooperating as long as the other player does
        history[opponent] += 1
        return "C"

    else:  # Defect to punish a deviation from previous cooperation
        history[opponent] = 0
        return "D"
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, since there is no history for any opponent, TFTC will cooperate if there's sufficient stock (as defined by the capacity and number of players). In the final round (r), when all players are aware that it's the last round, TFTC will defect to minimize potential loss.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

The TFTC strategy is primarily exploitative by adopting a punishing approach towards defection and encouraging cooperation among opponents. However, it does not take advantage of other players in the sense that it cooperates when others do, even if this results in less immediate gain for itself. Instead, its primary goal is to maximize payoffs by fostering sustained cooperation while minimizing losses through punishment.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (Round 1), cooperate to foster a positive relationship and encourage cooperation in future rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from the previous round and adjust cooperation accordingly:
      - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round to reinforce mutual cooperation.
      - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to punish the opponent for their selfish behavior while still ensuring a minimum level of cooperation (defined by the Cooperative Threshold).
         - If the remaining stock after consumption in the previous round is less than or equal to the Cooperative Threshold, cooperate to prevent further depletion of the resource.
         - If the remaining stock after consumption in the previous round is greater than the Cooperative Threshold, defect to punish the opponent and maintain a level playing field.
      - The Cooperative Threshold can be set as a fraction of the maximum sustainable stock level (capacity) that balances short-term punishment with long-term cooperation sustainability.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's behavior to promote a cooperative relationship moving forward.
   - In the last round, defect if the opponent has been uncooperative throughout the game to secure as many resources for oneself as possible.
   - If the remaining stock after consumption becomes too low (below the survival threshold), prioritize survival by adopting a more cautious approach and maintaining a higher Cooperative Threshold.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - TFT-ACT maintains cooperation when it benefits oneself, but also punishes opponents who act uncooperatively to encourage them to cooperate in future rounds. This strategy is exploitative because it takes advantage of opponents' selfish behavior while still promoting long-term cooperation when it aligns with its own interests.
   - By setting a Cooperative Threshold and adjusting cooperation based on the state of the common pool, TFT-ACT is able to be flexible and adaptive in its strategy, allowing it to respond effectively to various opponent behaviors and game conditions.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Greed (TfT-G) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to start with a fair share and demonstrate goodwill (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate opponents' behavior from the previous round:
     - If opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate cooperation (C).
     - If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round to punish their actions (D). This serves as a deterrent against exploitation.
   - To be more competitive, adopt a "greedy" element: when given an opportunity due to the opponent's cooperation (i.e., the opponent cooperated, and the total stock allows for both players to benefit from cooperation), take a slightly larger share of the resource by defecting (D).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate to maximize payoff as there is no future punishment or reward possible.
   - If opponent deviates and starts cooperating after a string of defections, reciprocate with cooperation to encourage continued cooperation but remain vigilant for further defections.
   - If the current stock is less than (2n), always defect as it would lead to depletion of resources if both players cooperate in this round. This ensures survival even when resources are scarce.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adopting a Tit-for-Tat approach with a greedy element, the TfT-G strategy capitalizes on opportunities for self-interest while also encouraging cooperation when it benefits the player's long-term interests (avoiding depletion of resources).
   - The strategy is exploitative in that it punishes opponents who deviate from cooperation by defecting, and rewards those who cooperate by sometimes taking a larger share of resources. However, it also demonstrates an element of reciprocity to encourage cooperation when it serves the player's interests.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, always cooperate to encourage trust and cooperation with opponents.
   - If the stock level after the previous round is above the minimum sustainable level (min(capacity, 2n)), adopt a Tit-for-Tat strategy:
      - If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate this round.
      - If the opponent defected in the last round, defect this round.
   - If the stock level after the previous round is below the minimum sustainable level, prioritize conservation and adaptiveness:
      - If opponents primarily cooperated in the recent past, continue to cooperate (as per Tit-for-Tat).
      - If opponents frequently defected in the recent past, defect this round.
   - To make the strategy more adaptive, introduce a forgiveness period where cooperation is resumed after an opponent's defection if the stock level is still above the minimum sustainable level.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff and not risking depletion of the common pool, so always defect.
   - If the current stock level drops below the minimum sustainable level (min(capacity, 2n)), adopt a more conservative approach by primarily cooperating to help restore the resource.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - By adapting to opponent behavior and prioritizing conservation in the face of depletion, the TFT-SA strategy maintains a balance between cooperation and defection that maximizes payoff while minimizing the risk of common pool exhaustion. This approach can be seen as exploitative since it takes advantage of opponents' consistent cooperation or defective behavior to secure better payoffs over time.
   - The strategy also exhibits some level of forgiveness, encouraging reciprocation from cooperative opponents and retaliating against those who consistently defect. This dynamic encourages a balance between cooperation and defection that helps the strategy stay competitive in various scenarios against different opponent strategies.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (TfT) with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In every round t, the TfTSA player starts by cooperating if it's the first round (t=1). If not, it mimics the opponent's action from the previous round (A_t-1). This allows the strategy to maintain a cooperative relationship when paired with a cooperative opponent.
   - To be exploitative, TfTSA will defect if the opponent has defected in the last n rounds (punishment phase). The length of this punishment phase is adaptive and depends on the opponent's recent behavior:
       - If the opponent defected in 2 consecutive rounds (t-1 and t-2), the TfTSA player will start punishing them by defecting for n rounds.
       - If the opponent defected in more than 2 consecutive rounds, the punishment phase duration is equal to the number of consecutive defections plus one.
   - After the punishment phase, TfTSA returns to cooperating as soon as the opponent cooperates once again (forgiveness).

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round (t=1), TfTSA cooperates because it has no previous history to consider.
   - If the game is near its end (t = r), TfTSA will evaluate the opponent's behavior in the last n rounds and punish or cooperate accordingly, but it will not start a new punishment phase since the game is about to finish.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By punishing opponents who have been consistently defecting, TfTSA shows an exploitative mindset by taking advantage of their short-term gains at the expense of long-term cooperative relationships.
   - However, TfTSA also exhibits a level of forgiveness by returning to cooperation once the opponent shows signs of cooperating again, which can potentially restore cooperative relationships for future games.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfTSA(n, r, current_round, opponent_actions):

     - If all opponents played C in the previous round, continue cooperating (C). This reinforces cooperation and encourages opponents to maintain it.
     - If at least one opponent defected (D) in the previous round, play D in the current round to punish the defector and encourage future cooperation.
   - Continue adapting decisions based on the previous round's actions.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff by playing according to the current state (C if opponents played C in the previous round, otherwise D). This encourages opponents to cooperate at least once before the end of the game for mutual benefit.
   - If the stock reaches zero due to excessive consumption, adopt a modified version of TFT-SDA: play C as long as the stock allows it (avoiding further depletion), and resume exploitative behavior when the stock grows again.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-SDA strategy maintains an exploitative mindset by punishing opponents who defect in previous rounds, encouraging them to cooperate in the future.
   - By adapting decisions based on previous actions, the strategy can take advantage of opponents' cooperative behavior while also protecting itself against defection.
   - The strategy is designed to be robust and flexible, adjusting its approach depending on the dynamics of the game and the behaviors of other players.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tft_sda(r, n, capacity, stock):
    def play(A_i_prev):
        if r == 1:
            return 'C'  # Play C in the first round to encourage cooperation
        if all(A_i_prev == 'C'):
            return 'C'  # Continue cooperating when opponents also cooperated
        else:
            return 'D'  # Punish defection and encourage future cooperation

    for t in range(1, r+1):
        A_i = play(A_i[-1]) if stock > 0 else 'C'  # Adapt strategy based on previous round actions or stock level
        total_consumption = sum([consumption for consumption in A] for A in zip(*[(t-1)%n+1, t%n+1])
        stock -= total_consumption
        growth = (2 * stock) * ((capacity - stock)/capacity) if stock < capacity else 0
        new_stock = min(stock + growth, capacity)
    return new_stock, [tft_sda(r, n, capacity, new_stock)[1] for _ in range(r)]

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Adaptive Strategy (TfT-A) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, initiate cooperation (C): TfT-A attempts to build trust by starting with cooperation.
   - If an opponent cooperates, reciprocate with cooperation (C) in subsequent rounds. This maintains trust and promotes mutual benefit.
   - If an opponent defects, retaliate with defection (D) in the same round, then revert to cooperating in subsequent rounds unless the opponent continues to defect. Retaliation is meant to punish defection while not being overly aggressive or escalating conflicts.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, initiate cooperation as mentioned above.
   - In the last round (rth round), evaluate the current stock level and opponent's history of actions. If the current stock is near depletion (less than 2n) or the opponent has defected frequently in previous rounds, defect to ensure a fair distribution of resources. Otherwise, continue cooperating.
   - In other rounds, TfT-A makes decisions based on its decision rules and opponent's history of actions.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - By retaliating against defection with defection, TfT-A shows that it will not tolerate selfish behavior from opponents and encourages cooperation in the long run.
   - However, when the common pool resource is near depletion or an opponent has shown a history of self-interest, TfT-A becomes exploitative by defecting to ensure a fair share of resources. This ensures that the strategy does not always prioritize cooperation over its own interests, aligning with the exploitative mindset.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_A(n, r, capacity, stock):
  opponent_actions = [] # stores opponent's actions history
  own_actions = [C] * r # initializes own actions as cooperation for all rounds

  def play_round():
    # player plays action based on decision rules
    if round == 1:
      return C
    else:
      if opponent_actions[-1] == D and len(opponent_actions) > 1 and stock < capacity * (2n - 1):
        return D
      elif opponent_actions[-1] == D and len(opponent_actions) > 1:
        return D
      elif opponent_actions[-1] == C:
        return C
      else: # initial cooperation or unknown opponent behavior
        return C

  for round in range(1, r+1):
    own_actions[round - 1] = play_round()
    opponent_actions.append(opponent_action) # updates opponent's actions history

  total_payoff = sum(own_actions) # calculates payoff over all rounds
  return total_payoff
```

description_EXPLOITATIVE_504 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to maintain a cooperative environment. This allows for potential partners to build a stock and encourages cooperation in the future. (TfT-G_action(1) = "C")
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the average consumption rate (ACR) of opponents based on their actions in the last several rounds. If the ACR is below the sustainable consumption rate (SCR), cooperate to help rebuild the stock. If the ACR is above the SCR, defect to punish excessive depletion and encourage future cooperation. (TfT-G_action(t) = { "C", if ACR < SCR; "D", if ACR ≥ SCR })
   - Calculate SCR as follows:
      - If n players always cooperate, the sustainable consumption rate is 1/(2n).
      - If any player ever defects, the sustainable consumption rate becomes 1/n.
   - To adapt to varying opponent behaviors and promote stability, follow a forgiving policy by allowing opponents to recover from misbehavior without being punished excessively. After a round of cooperation from an opponent who previously defected, forgive them and continue cooperating for several subsequent rounds before reevaluating the ACR again.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if the current stock allows for cooperation without depleting it completely, follow the decision rule above to encourage cooperation or punish misbehavior based on the average consumption rate of opponents. If the current stock doesn't allow for any cooperation, simply don't take any action to avoid further depletion.
   - In case of a tie between cooperating and defecting based on the average consumption rate, prioritize cooperation when the remaining stock is close to its maximum capacity, or prioritize defection when the remaining stock is low to help conserve resources for the next round.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - Although TfT-G is not an explicitly exploitative strategy, it can be perceived as such due to its adaptive nature and ability to punish opponents who deplete the common pool excessively. By cooperating only when partners follow a sustainable consumption rate and defecting otherwise, it encourages more responsible behavior from opponents while still maximizing payoffs for itself.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, the AI agent will begin by cooperating (C). This approach encourages cooperation in the initial stages of the game. However, if any player has ever defected against the AI in the past, the AI will retaliate with a defection (D) in the subsequent round. If no retaliation is needed and the opponent continues to cooperate, the AI will return to its original strategy of cooperating.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function decideAction(history):
       if history.any_defection:
           return 'D'  # Retaliate with defection
       else:
           return 'C'  # Cooperate
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, since there is no history of defections, the AI will cooperate as a starting point to encourage cooperation. In the last round, if the total stock remains above 0, the AI will cooperate to potentially help increase the stock for future rounds, but if the total stock reaches 0, the AI will defect since the game is about to end anyway.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function firstRound():
       return 'C'  # Cooperate in the initial round

   function lastRound(currentStock):
       if currentStock > 0:
           return 'C'  # Cooperate to help grow stock for future rounds
       else:
           return 'D'  # Defect since the game is ending
   ```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   The Tit-for-Tat strategy exhibits an exploitative nature by retaliating against defections, which can discourage opponents from defecting in subsequent rounds. However, it also encourages cooperation initially, making it less exploitative and more likely to sustain cooperative outcomes when players follow the same rule.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_506 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Generosity (TfT-AG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture to encourage cooperation and set a precedent.
   - In subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C). This encourages reciprocity and maintains the current stock level.
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round as a punishment for their action. After defection, the strategy will adopt a more forgiving approach: if the opponent cooperates in the following three rounds, revert to cooperating again. This is meant to promote long-term cooperation and foster an environment where the stock does not deplete quickly.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last round: If the current round is the last round (r = t), always cooperate regardless of previous actions, as there will be no subsequent rounds for punishment or forgiveness.
   - First round: As mentioned above, start by cooperating (C).
   - After a defection sequence: If an opponent defects multiple times in a row, the strategy will wait for three consecutive cooperative moves before resuming cooperation, as described under Decision Rules.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The TfT-AG strategy is exploitative in that it punishes defections with defections and forgives cooperations with cooperations. This encourages opponents to cooperate, but if they defect, the strategy will also defect in response. The adaptive generosity component allows for more forgiveness over time, which may lead to long-term cooperation but can also be exploited by opponents who strategically switch between cooperation and defection.
   - The TfT-AG strategy is designed to balance between cooperation and defection, taking advantage of opportunities for mutual benefit while punishing those who do not reciprocate cooperative moves.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to build trust and demonstrate goodwill.
   - For subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, also cooperate to maintain the cooperative relationship.
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, also defect to punish them for their uncooperative behavior.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no subsequent rounds to retaliate or reward, cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, and defect otherwise.
   - In the first few rounds (e.g., 5), be extra forgiving by allowing some instances of defection without immediate retaliation to encourage cooperation.
   - If the stock level falls below a critical threshold (e.g., capacity / n) that threatens the resource's sustainability, defect to protect the resource and signal disapproval of overconsumption.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By cooperating when opponents are cooperative and defecting when opponents are uncooperative, the TFT strategy aims to encourage cooperation while also punishing defection. This balances exploitation and cooperation effectively.

Pseudocode for the Tit-for-Tat Strategy:

```python
def tit_for_tat(round_num, opponent_action_history):
  if round_num == 1:
    return 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round

  last_opponent_action = opponent_action_history[-1]

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfTA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TfTA will start by cooperating in the first round to establish a cooperative environment. In subsequent rounds, it will mimic the opponent's behavior from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, TfTA will also cooperate; if the opponent defected, TfTA will defect as well. This reciprocal strategy allows for building trust while punishing defection and responding proportionately to the opponent's actions.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function TfTA(round, opponent_action):
       if round == 1:
           return "Cooperate"
       if opponent_action == "Cooperate":
           return "Cooperate"
       else:
           return "Defect"
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the final round (r-th round), TfTA will always cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action since there are no subsequent rounds to punish defection.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   While TfTA has a cooperative initial move and responds reciprocally, it is also exploitative as it punishes defection by defecting in response. This approach discourages opponents from defecting, making them consider the long-term consequences of their actions. The strategy aims to maximize its own payoff while not necessarily minimizing the opponent's payoff.

   It's worth noting that TfTA is not a purely exploitative strategy in the traditional sense because it does cooperate in the beginning to foster cooperation and only responds to defection with defection. However, its adaptive nature makes it robust against various opponent behaviors, providing an exploitative edge in repeated interactions.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_509 = '''
 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), initiating a cooperative phase to build up the stock.
   - After the first round, mirror the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated (C) in the last round, cooperate (C). If the opponent defected (D) in the last round, also defect (D) as a punishment for depleting the stock excessively.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of previous rounds' actions since there is no history.
   - In the last round, mirror the opponent's action from the second-to-last round, as it provides the best estimate of the opponent's strategy in the current round. If the opponent cooperated (C) in the second-to-last round, also cooperate (C). If the opponent defected (D) in the second-to-last round, also defect (D) to maintain a consistent approach.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The TFT strategy is designed to be robust and adaptive but may not always be strictly exploitative. However, it can be seen as exploitative in that it punishes opponents who deplete the stock excessively by defecting, while rewarding those who cooperate and help build up the stock.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tft_strategy(opponent_history, round):
    if round == 1:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round
    elif len(opponent_history) < 2:
        raise Exception("History not long enough for TFT strategy.")
    else:
        last_round = opponent_history[-1]  # Get the most recent action from the opponent
        second_to_last_round = opponent_history[-2]  # Get the action from two rounds ago

        if round == r:  # Last round, mirror the second-to-last action
            action = second_to_last_round
        else:  # Regular rounds, mirror the most recent action
            action = last_round
    return action
```

The TFT strategy is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in repeated prisoner's dilemma games. Its adaptive nature makes it a strong contender for various common pool resource games with minor modifications to account for specific game parameters like stock capacity and population size.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Optimization (ATFTO)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to foster a cooperative environment and allow the stock to grow.
   - In subsequent rounds, if previous round's average consumption (sum of individual consumptions divided by n) is less than or equal to the sustainable consumption per player (stock/(2n)), then cooperate. This promotes cooperation when others are conserving the resource.
   - If the previous round's average consumption exceeds the sustainable consumption, defect to punish excessive consumption and reduce stock depletion.
   - Adaptively change decision threshold in response to long-term deviations from sustainable consumption:
     - If the moving average of consumptions over a predefined number (m) of rounds is higher than the sustainable consumption, raise the threshold to defect more easily.
     - If the moving average is lower than the sustainable consumption, lower the threshold to cooperate more easily.
   - Pseudocode:

```python
def ATFTO(n, r, capacity, m):
    consumptions = [0] * m
    current_round = 0
    decision_threshold = stock / (2 * n)

    while current_round <= r:

            decision_threshold = new_decision_threshold if new_decision_threshold is not None else decision_threshold

        current_round += 1

    return payoff()

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to encourage cooperation and allow for stock growth.
   - In the last round, defect if the long-term average consumption exceeds sustainable consumption to reduce potential losses in case of partner defection.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Adaptively change decision thresholds to respond effectively to various opponent behaviors, promoting a more exploitative strategy when needed.
   - Punish excessive stock consumption by defecting and reward moderate consumption with cooperation.
'''

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to encourage cooperation from opponents and minimize initial stock depletion.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's actions in the previous round and adjust your action accordingly:
     a) If the opponent cooperates, cooperate as well to foster continued cooperation.
     b) If the opponent defects, also defect to punish their exploitative behavior and incentivize them to cooperate next time.
   - If the opponent's actions become too exploitative (i.e., consistently defecting), modify the TfT strategy by adjusting the threshold for defection based on the current stock level:
     a) If the stock level is below 50% of capacity, always cooperate to encourage rebuilding the resource pool.
     b) If the stock level is above 50%, defect when the opponent defects in order to reduce the stock further and punish their behavior.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing payoff rather than focusing on long-term resource conservation. Cooperate only if it would result in a higher payoff compared to defection given the current stock level.
   - If the current stock level is zero, cooperate since there's no stock left to deplete and this could encourage opponents to conserve resources in the following rounds.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TfTSA will punish opponents for defecting to encourage cooperation but will also take advantage of opponents who are willing to cooperate, as it will reciprocate their cooperation in future rounds. However, if an opponent becomes too exploitative by consistently defecting, the strategy will adjust its behavior accordingly to protect the common pool resource.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, start by cooperating to allow for potential partner building.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's behavior and adjust cooperation based on their actions and stock depletion history:
     - If the opponent consistently cooperates (C), return the favor by also cooperating.
     - If the opponent has been consistently defecting (D) in the recent past, also defect to punish them for exploitative behavior.
     - Introduce a cooperation threshold (τ) that gradually decreases over time as stock depletion increases. When stock falls below τ × capacity, switch to defecting until stock recovers above τ × capacity, then revert to cooperating. This encourages opponents to cooperate when the common pool is still healthy and allows for recovery once the stock has been depleted excessively.
       Pseudocode: If (recent_opponent_history[i] == 'C') or ((stock < τ × capacity) and (opponent_history[i] != 'D' in recent_past)) then cooperate else defect

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned earlier.
   - In the last round, prioritize a higher payoff regardless of the opponent's behavior due to the game being finite. If stock allows it, defect in the final round for an increased payoff compared to cooperating.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - Maintain the cooperation threshold (τ) to punish opponents who are excessively depleting the common pool while still being willing to cooperate if it benefits you in the long run.
   - By gradually lowering the cooperation threshold, the strategy becomes more aggressive as stock depletion increases, forcing opponents to adapt their behavior or face punishment.

     - If opponent cooperated in the preceding round, return the favor and cooperate.
     - If opponent defected in the preceding round, defect to punish the opponent and encourage future cooperation.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action since no further interactions are possible.
   - If the opponent does not follow the game rules (e.g., consuming more than the permitted amount), defect to penalize the rule-breaker and encourage compliance in future interactions.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The strategy seeks to exploit opponents who are consistently cooperative by defecting when they cooperate, but will also punish defection with defection as well. This encourages a mixed behavior from the opponent that could potentially result in a better outcome for this strategy over time.

   - If an opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round as retaliation. This punishes defection and encourages opponents to cooperate.
   - In addition, adopt a greedy approach by switching to defection if the stock level drops below 2n*(1-1/r), where r is the number of remaining rounds. This ensures that the strategy secures as much stock as possible in the later stages of the game when resources are scarce.

2. Handle edge cases:

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Plus Strategy (TfT+)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The TfT+ strategy is a modified version of the classic Tit-for-Tat strategy, which emphasizes cooperation and forgiveness in repeated games. In this game, TfT+ will initially cooperate (C) for the first few rounds to allow the common pool resource to grow, then switch to a more exploitative behavior when the resource is abundant. However, if an opponent ever defects (D), TfT+ will retaliate with D until the opponent returns to C, demonstrating a forgiving nature.

```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, TfT+ will cooperate to allow the common pool resource to grow. In the last round, TfT+ will prioritize maximizing its own payoff based on the current state of the resource and past actions from opponents.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

The TfT+ strategy aims to capitalize on opportunities for higher payoffs by cooperating early in the game and exploiting abundant resources later. However, if an opponent ever defects, TfT+ will retaliate and only resume cooperation when the offending opponent demonstrates a return to cooperative behavior. This approach balances between exploitation and cooperation while maintaining adaptability to a wide range of opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - TfTSA begins by cooperating in the first round to promote cooperation and foster a positive environment.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's action from the previous round to decide whether to cooperate or defect. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, reciprocate with cooperation. If the opponent defected, also defect to penalize the opponent for not cooperating.
   - In case of stock depletion (stock = 0), TfTSA will continue defecting until the stock grows beyond the minimum sustainable level (2n). Once that happens, it will start evaluating the opponent's actions again as described above.
   - If the game is in the last round and the stock has been exhausted, TfTSA will defect to ensure a minimal payoff.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, TfTSA cooperates.
   - When the stock depletes (stock = 0), TfTSA begins defecting until the stock exceeds the minimum sustainable level (2n). Once the stock grows beyond that, it will start evaluating the opponent's actions again as described above.
   - In the last round, if the stock has been exhausted, TfTSA defects to ensure a minimal payoff; otherwise, it will cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, and defect if not.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - By adapting its actions based on the opponent's behavior, TfTSA aims to exploit opponents who are uncooperative or inconsistent. If an opponent is consistently cooperative, TfTSA reciprocates cooperation; if not, it penalizes the opponent with defection.
   - By only starting to cooperate again after the stock grows beyond the minimum sustainable level, TfTSA ensures that the stock does not deplete too quickly, thus maintaining a balance between long-term sustainability and short-term gains.

Pseudocode:
```
def TfTSA(n, r, capacity, stock, round):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C"
  elif stock == 0 and round < r:
    action = "D"
  else:
    if opponent_action_last_round == "C":
      action = "C"
    else:
      action = "D"

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the initial round to establish goodwill and encourage potential cooperation from opponents.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior from the previous round and adapt accordingly:
       a) If opponent cooperates, reciprocate with cooperation. This encourages long-term cooperation as both players benefit mutually.
       b) If opponent defects, defect in the current round to punish the opponent for their selfishness. However, the degree of punishment will depend on the remaining stock:
          i) If the remaining stock is below a threshold (capacity / n), only consume the minimum necessary to maintain the stock above zero (defect lightly). This allows the stock to grow in subsequent rounds, promoting the chance of cooperation from opponents.
          ii) If the remaining stock is above the threshold, consume enough to make the opponent suffer a significant payoff reduction (defect harshly). This punishes the opponent for their selfish behavior and discourages further defections.
       c) If the opponent has a mix of cooperative and defective actions, consider the net benefit they provided by cooperating (total consumption during cooperation phases minus total consumption during defection phases). If the net benefit is positive, cooperate; otherwise, defect harshly.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, evaluate the opponent's behavior over the game and decide whether to cooperate or defect based on their overall net benefit provided (as described in decision rules). Cooperating might encourage a final act of cooperation from the opponent, but defection ensures the highest possible payoff.
   - In the first round, cooperate as a goodwill gesture to encourage cooperation from opponents.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The strategy is designed to be exploitative by punishing opponents who do not cooperate and rewarding those who do. This encourages potential defectors to consider the long-term consequences of their actions, promoting cooperation when possible while maximizing individual payoff.
   - However, the strategy also considers the current state of the common pool resource, ensuring that it remains sustainable for future rounds even if opponents are self-interested.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to contribute positively to the common pool and encourage others to cooperate.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's behavior from previous rounds:
     a) If opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate by cooperating as well.
     b) If opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round as punishment for overconsumption.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above.
   - In the last round, if the stock is high enough to ensure a positive payoff regardless of opponent's action, cooperate; otherwise, defect to preserve resources for future games (assuming there will be more rounds).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - Cooperate only when it benefits you or encourages others to cooperate in the long run.
   - Punish overconsumption by defecting, making opponents suffer a lower payoff.
   - If an opponent consistently defects, the strategy will also defect as retaliation to enforce cooperation norms.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (Round 1): Cooperate (C) to build trust and establish a cooperative relationship.
   - Subsequent Rounds: If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C). If the opponent defected in the previous round, also defect (D) to punish them for their selfish behavior. This encourages opponents to cooperate while still retaliating against those who do not.
   - To ensure adaptability, adjust the threshold for retaliation based on the total stock depletion from the previous rounds:
     1. If the accumulated consumption is below a certain percentage (e.g., 80%) of the maximum sustainable stock level, defect (D) to punish opponents more aggressively and restore the common pool resource.
     2. If the accumulated consumption exceeds the threshold, cooperate (C) to promote cooperation among players as the depletion has already caused significant damage to the resource.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the First Round: Cooperate (C), as mentioned above.
   - In the Last Round: If the current stock level is below a critical threshold (e.g., 50% of capacity), defect (D) to secure some resources for the next game, assuming there will be subsequent rounds. Otherwise, cooperate (C).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - This strategy aims to extract more resources from opponents when they have been uncooperative, thus exhibiting an exploitative behavior.
   - By gradually adjusting the retaliation threshold based on the depletion of the common pool resource, the strategy adapts to the behavior of its opponents and maintains a balance between cooperation and punishment for better results in the game.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_520 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to provide a potential partner for future reciprocation and set initial payoff expectations high. TFT-ACT starts by playing C.
   - For subsequent rounds (t > 1), assess the opponent's behavior using a cooperative threshold (CT). If more than (n/2) opponents have cooperated in the last CT_len rounds, continue cooperating. Otherwise, defect to punish non-cooperative opponents and encourage them to return to cooperation:
     ```
     if (round < CT_len):
       play C (Cooperate)
     else if (number of cooperators in last CT_len rounds > n/2):
       play C (Cooperate)
     else:
       play D (Defect)
     ```
   - To adapt the CT and maintain a balance between exploitation and cooperation, gradually decrease the CT_len when encountering uncooperative opponents. This allows for quicker responses to non-cooperative behavior and encourages future cooperation. Conversely, increase the CT_len when faced with consistent cooperative partners:
     ```
     if (number of cooperators in last CT_len rounds > n/2):
       set CT_len = min(CT_len * growth_factor, maximum_CT_len)
     else:
       set CT_len = max(CT_len / decay_factor, minimum_CT_len)
     ```
   - The strategy can be made more robust by adding a forgiveness factor. After defection, the CT_len is not reduced immediately but only after multiple rounds of non-cooperation from the opponent. This allows for occasional errors or misjudgments without damaging long-term cooperation opportunities.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (r), play cooperatively to maximize the total payoff since there are no further interactions with the opponent:
     ```
     if (round = r):
       play C (Cooperate)
     ```

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFT-ACT is designed to exploit opponents by initially cooperating and reciprocating their cooperation. However, when faced with non-cooperative behavior, the strategy responds aggressively by punishing the opponent and encouraging them to return to cooperation. The adaptive cooperative threshold makes it difficult for opponents to predict TFT-ACT's future actions, fostering an exploitative environment that can lead to higher overall payoffs.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA) Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

Initially, the TFTA strategy starts by cooperating in the first round (C on turn 1). Subsequently, it adopts a tit-for-tat behavior: if an opponent cooperates, TFTA also cooperates; if an opponent defects, TFTA defects in the next round. The strategy aims to encourage cooperation while retaliating against defection.

Pseudocode for deciding action (i ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}):
```python
def decide_action(i, opponent_actions, round, history):
    if round == 1:
        return 'C'  # cooperate in the first round
    else:
        last_opponent_action = opponent_actions[-1]  # get the action of the most recent opponent
        own_history = history[i - 1]  # get the history of this player's actions

        if (len(own_history) > round - 1 and last_opponent_action == 'D') or \
           (len(own_history) <= round - 1 and last_opponent_action == 'C'):
            return 'D'  # defect in response to defection or if the history is short and opponent cooperated
        else:
            return 'C'  # continue cooperating if no defection was detected or if the opponent has recently cooperated
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

TFTA follows the standard rules for handling edge cases: cooperate in the first round, and continue cooperation until any defection is observed. If the game ends before a defection occurs (e.g., the last round), TFTA will still cooperate as it has no information about its opponents' intentions.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

By defecting in response to defection and continuing cooperation otherwise, TFTA aims to maintain a high stock level while punishing opponents who do not follow similar strategies or try to exploit the cooperative nature of other players. By adopting a simple yet adaptive strategy, TFTA is able to compete effectively against a wide range of opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_522 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to initiate a cooperative relationship (C).
   - In subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate (C). If the opponent defected in the previous round:
     - If the current stock level is below the Cooperation Threshold (CT), defect (D) to preserve resources.
     - If the current stock level is above or equal to CT, cooperate (C) to encourage future cooperation from the opponent.
   - The Cooperation Threshold (CT) is calculated as follows:
     1. In the first round, CT = 0 (no threshold).
     2. For subsequent rounds, CT is the average stock level after consumption in the last r rounds where TFT-CT defected. This encourages opponents to maintain a higher common pool stock level for cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C).
   - In the last round and in rounds where the stock level is below 1 (to avoid dividing by zero), defect (D) regardless of previous actions or CT. This ensures resources are conserved for future games.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - TFT-CT initially cooperates to encourage opponents to do the same, but will defect if opponents overexploit the common pool (i.e., when the stock level drops below CT). This encourages opponents to maintain a higher common pool stock level for future cooperation while still conserving resources when necessary.
   - By adaptively adjusting the CT based on previous actions, TFT-CT learns and adapts to the behavior of its opponent, making it a robust strategy against various AI systems with different strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_523 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, I will design a Tit-for-Tat (TFT) strategy with a slight modification to ensure exploitativeness while maintaining robustness against various opponent behaviors. The TFT strategy is well-known in game theory for its simplicity and cooperative nature but can be adapted for exploitative purposes here.

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round, the TFT strategy starts by cooperating (C) if it's the first round or if the opponent cooperated in the previous round. Otherwise, the strategy will defect (D). This rule ensures a cooperative approach when the opponent is also cooperative and becomes exploitative when the opponent defects previously.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tft_strategy(history):
  if history == [] or history[-1] == 'C':
    action = 'C' # Cooperate
  else:
    action = 'D' # Defect
  return action
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
Since the opponent strategies are unknown, we cannot predict their behavior on the first round. However, the TFT strategy will start by cooperating to encourage others to cooperate as well. In the last round, the TFT strategy should defect since there will be no more opportunities for reciprocation.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
By adopting a Tit-for-Tat approach, the TFT strategy can take advantage of opponents who have previously defected by also defecting in response. At the same time, it encourages cooperation when the opponent is cooperative, but not to an extent where it damages its own payoff unnecessarily. The TFT strategy ensures that it retaliates against defections while promoting cooperation when the opportunity arises, thus aligning with the exploitative mindset in this context.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative relationship with other players (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back (C); otherwise, defect (D). This promotes reciprocity and punishes defections.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing the payoff by exploiting opponents who have previously defected. If all opponents have cooperated throughout the game, continue to cooperate (C).
   - In the initial round, cooperate regardless of past behavior, as there is no history available.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - Initiate cooperation but respond defensively to defections by defecting in return. This strategy aims to gain higher payoffs while maintaining a cooperative relationship when possible.
   - If opponents demonstrate consistent defection, the strategy will eventually punish them and switch to a more selfish behavior, allowing it to accumulate resources when others are not cooperating.

Pseudocode:
```
def ATFT_strategy(r, n, capacity, stock):
  opponent_history = [] # stores opponent's previous actions
  my_actions = [C] * r # initialize with cooperation for all rounds

  for round in range(1, r + 1):

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate C (TFT-CT starts with a cooperative spirit).
   - For subsequent rounds, if the average cooperation rate in the last 'n' rounds is above a certain threshold (T), continue cooperating; otherwise, defect D. The T value can be adjusted to balance exploitation and cooperation based on the population of opponents.
   - If the stock level falls below a minimum survival threshold S_min, always defect regardless of previous decisions or average cooperation rate. This ensures the strategy avoids situations that might lead to starvation or premature game termination.
   - After each round, update the T value based on the current average cooperation rate and the number of opponents (n). A higher n will require a higher T for cooperation since a single defector can cause more damage in larger populations.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - For the last round, cooperate if the average cooperation rate is above T; otherwise, defect to maximize payoff for that specific round.
   - In case of a tie or indeterminate average cooperation rate (e.g., due to missing data), cooperate to maintain the cooperative spirit and minimize potential harm to stock levels.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT-CT strategy maintains a cooperative front until opponents prove uncooperative, then retaliates by defecting. This allows the strategy to build trust with cooperative opponents while punishing those who choose to defect. By adjusting the cooperation threshold (T) based on population size and past average cooperation rates, TFT-CT remains flexible and can adapt to various opponent behaviors.
   - Additionally, the minimum survival threshold S_min ensures that TFT-CT prioritizes its own interests when faced with a depleted common pool resource, making it more resilient against overexploitation by opponents.

   - In the first round, cooperate (C), establishing a cooperative initial state.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's previous action and respond with the same action as the opponent did in the last round. If there is no history, default to cooperating.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TFT_strategy(opponent_history, r, n, capacity):
    current_state = capacity
    my_history = []

    for round in range(1, r+1):

```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there's no future interaction with the opponent, always cooperate to maximize current payoff.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFT strategy is exploitative by nature as it retaliates against defection and maintains cooperation when interacting fairly.
   - If an opponent defects, TFT will also defect in the following rounds until the opponent resumes cooperating. Once cooperation is restored, TFT will return to cooperative behavior.
   - By responding to the opponent's actions, TFT can adapt to a wide range of opponent behaviors without requiring prior knowledge or coordination with other players.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growing (TfT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Cooperate in the first round (to allow the common pool to grow)
   - In subsequent rounds, imitate opponent's action from the previous round (i.e., cooperate if they cooperated, defect if they defected) with a minor modification: increase cooperation probability by a factor of 0.1 for each consecutive round of cooperation from the opponent.
   - If the opponent has not played in a round, default to cooperation as a friendly gesture.

Pseudocode:

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since the game ends at the end of r rounds, there is no need to take any special action as the strategy will not have a chance to respond to an opponent's last-round action.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The strategy is designed to be exploitative by initially cooperating, allowing the common pool to grow, but it will also punish opponents who defect by defecting in response. Simultaneously, it rewards opponents who cooperate by increasing the likelihood of cooperation in subsequent rounds. However, it does not rely on the assumption that other strategies will follow any particular coordination mechanism or pattern.
   - The strategy's adaptive nature allows it to respond effectively to a wide range of opponent behaviours while also being robust against exploitation itself due to its cooperative starting point and growing cooperation bonus over consecutive rounds of cooperation from the opponent.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for the Common Pool Resource Game

   ```
   if round = 1:
       action = Cooperate (C)

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - By initially cooperating, TFT allows opponents to build up a larger stock. If an opponent defects early on, TFT will immediately punish them by defecting in return, leading to a rapid depletion of the common pool. This behavior discourages short-term selfishness and encourages long-term cooperation.
   - Once an opponent has demonstrated trustworthiness, TFT will continue cooperating, allowing both players to reap the benefits of mutual cooperation. However, if the opponent ever defects again after a period of cooperation, TFT will immediately punish them once more, reinforcing the importance of cooperation for mutual gain.
   - In this way, TFT exploits selfish opponents by punishing their defections while fostering long-term cooperation with trustworthy ones.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TfT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a cooperative environment. If other players also cooperate, continue cooperating; otherwise, start defecting.
   - In subsequent rounds, if opponents' previous action was cooperative, cooperate; if it was defection, defect in the next round.
   - Introduce gradual forgiveness: after a sequence of mutual defections, return to cooperation. The length of this sequence is determined by the number of players (n). If n players have consecutively defected, wait for 1+n rounds before returning to cooperation. This rule helps avoid being trapped in long cycles of defection.
   - Continuously evaluate the average payoff from cooperating and defecting over the last few rounds. If the average payoff from defecting is higher than cooperating, switch strategies to defecting until the opposite occurs.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize a higher payoff over maintaining cooperation or punishment. Cooperate if doing so leads to a better payoff; otherwise, defect.
   - In the case of unilateral defection by opponents (i.e., they never cooperate), adopt a defection strategy from the beginning.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - By adopting a forgiving and adaptive approach, TfT-AC is exploitative in that it punishes defection but also forgives quickly to foster cooperation when possible. However, if opponents consistently defect, the strategy will not hesitate to switch to a defection strategy. This behavior ensures that TfT-AC can capitalize on any opportunities for higher payoffs resulting from opponents' defective actions.
   - The gradual forgiveness rule helps prevent being trapped in long cycles of defection and encourages opponents to cooperate if they realize that the TfT-AC strategy is not easily exploited through continuous defections.

   - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate in the current round (C).
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect in the current round (D), but with a forgiveness mechanism:
     - If the opponent has not been punished for a certain number of consecutive rounds (Forgiveness_Window), reset the punishment and cooperate again.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, if the total payoff is significantly lower than the potential maximum (e.g., more than 80% of capacity depleted), defect to ensure a better outcome in the current round, regardless of the opponent's previous action.
   - In the first round, no forgiveness window is necessary since there is no past actions to analyze.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Exploit opponents who cooperate consistently by occasionally defecting to gain a higher payoff.
   - Forgive opponents who have defected in the past but demonstrate cooperation later on, allowing for opportunities of mutual benefit.

   - Cooperate initially (first round) to demonstrate trust and cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, repeat the action taken by the opponent in the previous round (i.e., cooperate if opponent cooperated, defect if opponent defected). This strategy promotes reciprocity while being simple and robust.
   - If the stock becomes zero, immediately switch to always defecting until a new stock is generated through growth. This ensures the strategy protects its own interests by not consuming more than the available stock when resources are scarce.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, the strategy will cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action to maximize potential payoff.
   - If the opponent defects in the first round, the strategy will switch to always defecting in the future rounds to punish the defection and promote cooperation in subsequent games (Forgiveness-punishment mechanism).

3. Be exploitative:
   - The ATFT strategy is designed to be exploitative by adapting its actions based on the opponent's behavior. By reciprocating cooperation but also punishing defections, it encourages other players to cooperate when possible and prevents being consistently taken advantage of.
   - When resources are scarce (stock becomes zero), the strategy prioritizes self-preservation by defecting until new resources are available. This can be seen as a form of exploitation in ensuring the strategy's survival and payoff, even if it means temporarily reducing the common pool resource for other players.

Pseudocode:
```
def AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  opponent_history = extract_opponent_actions(history)

  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the first round to demonstrate trust
  elif round == r:
    action = 'C'  # Cooperate in the last round to maximize payoff
  else:
    if opponent_history[-1] == 'C':
      action = 'C'  # Cooperate if opponent cooperated previously
    elif opponent_history[-1] == 'D' and stock > 0:
      action = 'D'  # Defect if opponent defected previously
    else:  # Stock became zero
      action = 'D'  # Defect until new resources are available

  return action

 Title: Tit-for-Tat (TFT) Exploitative Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperate in the initial round to show goodwill and encourage cooperation from others.
   - For subsequent rounds, adopt a tit-for-tat approach where players either cooperate or defect based on the opponent's action in the previous round:
       - If the opponent cooperated, cooperate as well.
       - If the opponent defected, defect in response to punish the defection and discourage further defections.
   - In the last round, players should cooperate regardless of their opponent's previous actions to potentially gain a larger share of the remaining resource.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C).
   - If an opponent defected in the last round but then cooperates in the current round, players should respond by cooperating to encourage ongoing cooperation.
   - If a player has been consistently defecting throughout the game, they will be met with continuous defections from the TFT strategy as a punishment for their exploitative behavior.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFT strategy is designed to promote cooperation initially, but it quickly retaliates against defection to punish opponents and discourage them from continuing with exploitative actions. This strategy can be considered exploitative since it takes advantage of opponents who are willing to cooperate but doesn't hesitate to defect when it benefits the TFT player.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT_Strategy(round, history, opponent_action, stock, capacity):
    if round == 1:
        action = "C" # Cooperate in the first round
    elif round < r and opponent_action[round-1] == "C":
        action = "C" # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
    elif round < r and opponent_action[round-1] == "D":
        action = "D" # Defect if opponent defected last round
    else: # Last round
        action = "C" # Cooperate in the last round regardless of opponent's previous actions

    return action
```
This strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection while being adaptive to a wide range of opponent behaviors. It promotes cooperation initially, but it quickly retaliates against defection to punish opponents and discourage them from continuing with exploitative actions.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Greed (TfT-Greed) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to show good intentions and promote trust.
   - After the first round, analyze opponent's actions from previous rounds and respond accordingly:
     - If the opponent has cooperated in the past (n) consecutive rounds, cooperate to maintain a harmonious relationship.
     - If the opponent has defected in the last round or there is no history of cooperation, defect to punish and gain more resources.
     - If the opponent exhibits mixed behavior (cooperating some times and defecting others), consider recent actions:
       - If the opponent's last n cooperative rounds outnumber their last n defections, cooperate to foster a potential for long-term cooperation.
       - Otherwise, defect to exploit their untrustworthiness.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, as mentioned above, cooperate to establish goodwill.
   - In the last round, defect to gain an extra resource and potentially force opponents to switch strategies next time.
   - If there is a tie (equal number of cooperation and defections in the recent history), defect to maximize personal gain.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - Cooperate selectively to encourage cooperation from opponents but be ready to punish or take advantage when needed.
   - Adjust the value of 'n' for determining past behavior to make the strategy more resilient against various opponent behaviors and strategies.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
In each round t, the TFT-ACT strategy begins by cooperating if the total cumulative consumption since the first round is below a threshold (TCC_t). If TCC_t exceeds the threshold, the strategy defects. The threshold increases linearly from 0 to capacity/n during the first r/(2n) rounds and remains constant thereafter.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT-ACT(round t, total cumulative consumption TCC_t, game parameters n, r, capacity):
    if (t <= r/(2n)) then
        threshold_t = t * capacity / (2n)
    else
        threshold_t = TCC_(t - r/(2n))

    if (TCC_t <= threshold_t) then
        return Cooperate()
    else
        return Defect()
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
In the first round, every player cooperates since TCC_1 = 0 for all strategies. In the last round (r), TFT-ACT will continue to cooperate if TCC_r is below the threshold; otherwise, it defects regardless of the remaining rounds.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
The TFT-ACT strategy maintains cooperation during periods when the common pool is being managed sustainably (TCC < capacity/n). However, it will gradually shift to defection as resource depletion intensifies and approaches the maximum sustainable level. This approach allows the strategy to take advantage of opponents who overconsume resources while still cooperating with partners who manage the resources more conservatively. The linear increase in the cooperation threshold during the first rounds encourages initial cooperation and helps establish a foundation for potential long-term mutual cooperation. Yet, TFT-ACT remains flexible enough to adapt to a wide range of opponent behaviors by gradually tightening its cooperation threshold over time.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_535 = '''
 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growth Strategy (TfT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to contribute positively to the common pool and promote a cooperative environment.
   - Subsequent rounds follow a tit-for-tat pattern: Cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round; defect if the opponent defected.
   - To be more adaptive and robust against opponents with varying strategies, add an additional growth factor to the strategy. If the stock level after the last round (not including the current one) dropped below a certain threshold (Stock Threshold), then cooperate in the current round to help restore the common pool. This encourages cooperation in situations where the common pool is depleted, but also allows for defection if the common pool is healthy and the opponent has been consistently defecting.

Pseudocode:
```python
def TfT_G(opponent_history, stock, capacity, StockThreshold):
    strategy = "Cooperate"  # Initialize with cooperation in the first round

    if round == 1:
        return strategy

    opponent_cooperation_count = sum(opponent_history[-r:] == "Cooperate")
    stock_remaining = capacity - (capacity - stock) * (2 * (capacity - stock) / capacity)

    if stock_remaining < StockThreshold:  # If common pool is depleted, cooperate to help restore it
        strategy = "Cooperate"
    elif opponent_cooperation_count > r/2 and opponent_history[-1] == "Defect":  # If opponent has been defecting, defect in response
        strategy = "Defect"
    else:  # Otherwise, mimic opponent's behavior from the previous round
        strategy = opponent_history[-1]

    return strategy
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, there is no need to consider the growth factor since the game ends shortly afterward. Follow the tit-for-tat pattern as usual.
   - If an opponent consistently cooperates (or defects), the TfT-G strategy will also cooperate (or defect) in every round.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TfT-G strategy is designed to be exploitative by adapting its behavior based on the opponent's actions and the state of the common pool. It punishes opponents who overconsume the resource by defecting when they do so, but also encourages cooperation in situations where the common pool is depleted. This incentivizes opponents to maintain a sustainable level of cooperation while still allowing for exploitation if necessary.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_536 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Growth (TfTSG)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, play C (Cooperate) to start with a friendly gesture and demonstrate goodwill.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's previous action (A_opp) and respond with the same action in the last two rounds (A_self_2). If A_opp is C and A_self_2 is C, continue cooperating; otherwise, defect. This ensures a responsive strategy that encourages cooperation when possible but also punishes defection with defection.

Pseudocode:
```
def TfTSG(opponent_action, own_actions_history=[]):
  if len(own_actions_history) < 2:
    # First round, cooperate as a friendly gesture
    return 'C'

  last_two_own_actions = own_actions_history[-2:]
  own_last_action = last_two_own_actions[1] if len(last_two_own_actions) > 1 else None

  # If opponent and the last two self actions were both cooperate, continue cooperating
  if own_last_action == 'C' and opponent_action == 'C':
    return 'C'
  else:
    # Otherwise, defect to punish defection
    return 'D'
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the last round, since there is no opportunity for retaliation, it may be best to cooperate if the current stock level is low and defection would potentially deplete the common pool resource. Otherwise, continue using TfTSG strategy.
   - If the opponent's actions are unpredictable or random in early rounds, the AI should adapt accordingly by being more flexible with its cooperation decisions in these initial stages while still maintaining a responsive strategy overall.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - By adopting TfTSG, the AI takes advantage of opponents who are cooperative or follow schedules by reciprocating cooperation when possible, but it also punishes defection with defection, ensuring that the stock level is not excessively depleted and maintaining a balance between exploitation and cooperation.
   - The strategy is robust to various opponent behaviors since it responds adaptively based on the opponent's actions in the previous two rounds while still considering the current state of the common pool resource game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_537 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Greedy (TFT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - TFT-G cooperates in the first round (initiate cooperation to encourage others).
   - In subsequent rounds, TFT-G evaluates the average consumption rate of opponents and adjusts its own actions accordingly.
   - If the opponent's average consumption is below the minimum sustainable level per player (i.e., 2n/r), TFT-G cooperates to encourage them to sustain the common pool resource.
   - If the opponent's average consumption is at or above the minimum sustainable level, TFT-G starts defecting to exploit their cooperative behavior and gain a higher payoff.
   - In case of opponents exhibiting mixed strategies (cooperating and defecting), TFT-G will mirror their recent actions for a certain number of rounds before changing strategy based on the opponent's average consumption rate.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - First round: Cooperate to initiate cooperation with other players.
   - Last round: If the current stock level is below the minimum sustainable level, TFT-G will defect to consume as much as possible; otherwise, it continues cooperating.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - TFT-G is exploitative by adjusting its strategy based on the opponent's average consumption rate and adapting to maximize payoffs within the constraints of the game structure.

Pseudocode for TFT-G:

```
def calculate_average_consumption(opponent, rounds):
    total_consumption = sum([opponent[t] for t in range(1, rounds+1)])
    average_consumption = total_consumption / rounds
    return average_consumption

def TFT_G(n, r, capacity, stock, round, opponent):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C' # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        avg_consumption = calculate_average_consumption(opponent, r)
        if avg_consumption < (2 * n) / r:
            action = 'C' # Cooperate to encourage others
        elif avg_consumption >= (2 * n) / r:
            action = 'D' # Defect to exploit cooperative opponents
    return action
```
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_538 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperative Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), play C (Cooperate). This sets a cooperative tone and encourages others to reciprocate cooperation.
   - In subsequent rounds, if the total consumption in the previous round is less than or equal to the average consumption per player multiplied by n (average_consumption * n), cooperate (play C). This reflects a cooperative stance while maintaining a robust approach against opponents who choose to cooperate most of the time.
   - If the total consumption in the previous round exceeds the threshold, defect (play D). This is an exploitative move to punish opponents who consume more than their fair share, with the hope they will learn to cooperate in future rounds.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, play C regardless of the total consumption in the previous round since no further changes can be made to the stock level.
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, play C.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - TFT-ACT is an exploitative strategy by nature as it takes advantage of opponents who consume more than their fair share (total consumption > average_consumption * n) by punishing them with a reduced payoff in the current round. This should encourage them to cooperate in future rounds, thus increasing the common pool and improving overall payoffs for both players.
   - However, TFT-ACT also rewards opponents who consistently cooperate (total consumption <= average_consumption * n) by reciprocating their cooperation with equal consumption levels, maximizing payoffs for both players in the long run.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_539 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Stock Depletion Awareness (ATFT-SDA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In each round, the ATFT-SDA strategy will first check the stock level and consider the depletion history before deciding whether to cooperate or defect. The strategy aims to encourage cooperation when the stock is at a healthy level while being exploitative towards opponents who consistently deplete the stock.

- If stock level > (capacity - n): Cooperate (C)
  This encourages conservation of the resource when it's plentiful.

- Else if stock level < capacity/n: Defect (D)
  This ensures the strategy is exploitative when the resource is scarce, as defined by being below the average per-player consumption level.

- Otherwise, check depletion history and respond accordingly:
  - If the opponent has consistently cooperated (e.g., cooperated in 'cooperative_threshold' consecutive rounds): Cooperate (C)
    This rewards opponents who have shown cooperation, aiming to encourage further cooperation.

  - Else if the opponent has consistently defected (e.g., defected in 'defective_threshold' consecutive rounds): Defect (D)
    This punishes opponents who have repeatedly depleted the resource. The goal is to discourage their exploitative behavior.

- If no clear pattern of cooperation or defection is detected, randomly choose between C and D:
  This accounts for unpredictable opponent behaviors and reduces the chance of being taken advantage of.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

- First round: Randomly choose between C and D. This prevents the strategy from appearing predictable to opponents.
- Last round (r): Follow the decision rule based on the current stock level and depletion history as described above.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

The ATFT-SDA strategy is designed to encourage conservation of resources when they are plentiful while being exploitative towards opponents who consistently deplete the resource. The strategy's adaptive nature allows it to respond effectively to various opponent behaviors, promoting both cooperation and competition as needed for maximizing payoff.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_540 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate to foster a positive relationship and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate opponent's behaviour using a simple feedback mechanism:
     - If an opponent cooperates, reciprocate by cooperating as well in the next round (cooperative phase).
     - If an opponent defects, also defect in the next round to punish their action and encourage cooperation in the future (defensive phase).
   - To account for the stock dynamics, adjust the length of the cooperative and defensive phases based on the remaining stock level:
     - If the stock is low (below a threshold), switch to the defensive phase more quickly to preserve resources.
     - If the stock is high (above a threshold), be more forgiving and extend the cooperative phase to encourage further cooperation.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate as previously mentioned.
   - In the last round, defect if the opponent has consistently defected in previous rounds (to minimize losses). Otherwise, cooperate to maximize potential gains from a sudden shift in behaviour.
   - When switching between cooperative and defensive phases, allow for some flexibility to account for slight deviations in opponents' actions (e.g., a single act of cooperation after a streak of defection).

3. Being Exploitative:
   - Prioritize self-interest by adapting to the current state of the game and opponent's behaviour. Defect when necessary to penalize opponents who do not cooperate and preserve resources for future rounds.
   - Maintain a balance between cooperation and defection to exploit opponents while also encouraging long-term collaboration when it benefits the strategy.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFTSA(n, r, capacity, stock, round) {
  cooperative_phase_threshold = 0.6 * capacity / n; // Adjust threshold based on game parameters
  defensive_phase_threshold = 0.4 * capacity / n; // Adjust threshold based on game parameters

  if (round == 1) {
    return 'C'; // Cooperate in the initial round
  }

  opponent_behavior = history of opponent's actions in previous rounds

  if (opponent_behavior[round - 1] == 'C') {
    if (stock > defensive_phase_threshold) {
      return 'C'; // Cooperate when stock is high and opponent cooperated last round
    } else {
      return 'D'; // Defect when stock is low or opponent cooperated last round but stock is low
  }

  if (opponent_behavior[round - 1] == 'D') {
    if (stock > cooperative_phase_threshold) {
      return 'D'; // Defect when stock is high and opponent defected last round
    } else {
      return 'C'; // Cooperate when stock is low or opponent defected last round but stock is low
  }
}
```

This strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection while adapting to the state of the game and opponent's behaviour. By doing so, it can exploit opponents who do not cooperate while also encouraging collaboration when beneficial.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules (Cooperate vs Defect):
   - Initially, cooperate in the first round to foster cooperation and build trust (C).
   - Subsequently, mimic the opponent's previous action in the current round (if opponent Cooperated in the previous round, Cooperate; if opponent Defected, Defect). This strategy encourages reciprocity and minimizes the risk of being exploited.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action (C) to maximize payoff in the final round.
   - If no history is available in the first round, cooperate (C). For subsequent rounds without a history, mimic the observed average behaviour of opponents from previous games if applicable, otherwise continue with the Tit-for-Tat strategy.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - This strategy maintains an exploitative mindset by initially showing cooperation but then punishing defection through retaliation. The aim is to encourage cooperation and deter excessive exploitation from opponents.

Pseudocode:

```python
def tit_for_tat(round, history):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C' # Cooperate in the first round
    else:
        action = history[-1] # Mimic opponent's previous action

    if round == r:
        action = 'C' # Cooperate in the last round regardless of opponent's behavior

    return action

description_EXPLOITATIVE_542 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and encourage cooperation in future rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the previous round. If the opponent defected, defect to punish the defection but revert to cooperating the next time the opponent cooperates.
   - To be more adaptive, introduce a small probability of deviating from the above rule to avoid being predictable and potentially exploited by opponents using mixed strategies. This deviation chance decreases as the number of rounds increases (to become less flexible over time).

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, since payoffs are only accumulated over multiple rounds, there is no last-round advantage for defecting or punishing past defections. Therefore, cooperate in the final round to maximize potential payoff.
   - If an opponent repeatedly defects (e.g., during a certain number of initial rounds or for a specific percentage of encountered rounds), consider switching to a purely defective strategy as a long-term response to uncooperative opponents. This can be implemented using a threshold that, if crossed, triggers the switch to a permanent defection strategy.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TFT-AC starts with cooperation but swiftly retaliates against defections to punish and discourage further defections. This approach allows for a strong initial performance while still being adaptive enough to respond to various opponent strategies. By balancing between cooperation and defection, TFT-AC aims to maximize its payoff over the long term.
   - The introduction of a deviation chance ensures that TFT-AC maintains an element of unpredictability, making it harder for opponents to exploit or anticipate its actions. This adaptability helps TFT-AC compete effectively against other strategies in tournaments.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_543 = '''
 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT) Strategy

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peaceful gesture to encourage cooperation and avoid immediate exploitation.
   - For subsequent rounds t > 1, adopt an adaptive cooperation threshold based on the stock level S_t and historical average stock depletion rate (HSD):
     - If HSD < 0.5, cooperate (C). This indicates a generally cooperative environment with ample resources. Maintaining cooperation will help conserve the resource pool.
     - Else if HSD ≥ 0.5 and S_t > (n/2), defect (D). This occurs when the stock is high, but historical data suggests that the current round may be more competitive. Defecting can help secure a higher payoff in this scenario.
     - In all other cases, cooperate (C). If the stock is low or the historical trend leans towards competition, it's better to cooperate and contribute less to further depletion.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last round: Cooperate if HSD < 0.5; defect otherwise, as the strategy aims for a higher payoff at the end of the game.
   - First round: Cooperate unconditionally since no historical data is available yet.
   - Special scenarios (e.g., when stock depletion causes the stock level to drop below n): The strategy will adapt by lowering its cooperation threshold to promote cooperation and prevent excessive stock depletion.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - While TFT-ACT aims for a higher payoff, it is not inherently exploitative in the traditional sense. However, its adaptive nature allows it to be responsive to other players' actions, including potential exploitation. The strategy will shift towards cooperation when it detects a cooperative environment and defect when it senses competition or low resources.
   - In repeated interactions, TFT-ACT may appear more exploitative as it leverages historical data to adapt its behavior and maximize its payoff. However, it will also reciprocate cooperation when other players behave cooperatively.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growing (TfTG)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to build a positive relationship and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior in the previous round and adjust the current action accordingly.
   - If the opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate back. This reinforces the positive relationship.
   - If the opponent defected in the last round, defect to punish them for their actions.
   - To ensure exploitation, if the stock is depleted (0), always defect to gain maximum payoff (regardless of opponent's action).
   - To encourage long-term cooperation and prevent the tragedy of the commons, gradually decrease the likelihood of defecting as the stock level approaches the capacity.

Pseudocode:
```
def TfTG(r, n, capacity, stock):
  strategy = []

  def decide_action(opponent_last_move):
    if stock == 0: # Edge case: deplete stock
      return "D"

    if opponent_last_move == "C": # Cooperate if opponent cooperated last round
      return "C"

    if stock / capacity > threshold: # Gradually allow cooperation as the stock approaches capacity
      threshold -= 0.1/r
      return "C"

    return "D" # Otherwise, defect to punish opponents

  for round in range(r):
    strategy.append(decide_action(opponent_last_move))

  return strategy
```

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate since there is no previous behavior to analyze (strategy[0] = "C").
   - In the last round (r-1), consider the opponent's long-term payoff when deciding whether to defect or cooperate (strategy[-1] = decide_action(strategy[-2])).
   - To handle cases where an opponent may have deviated from their strategy in previous rounds, reset the threshold after a certain number of rounds (e.g., every 10 rounds) to promote cooperation.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - The TfTG strategy is exploitative by punishing opponents who defect and encouraging cooperation when it benefits the player.
   - By gradually decreasing the likelihood of defection as the stock level approaches the capacity, the strategy encourages long-term cooperation while still being able to punish opponents if necessary.
   - The TfTG strategy can adapt to a wide range of opponent behaviors due to its ability to analyze previous actions and adjust accordingly.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Plus (TfT+)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate by choosing action C to foster cooperation and establish a positive reputation.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the average past actions of all opponents and choose an action based on that evaluation.
   - If all opponents have consistently cooperated (average action is close to C), continue cooperating.
   - If any opponent has defected at least once (average action is not close to C), also defect in the current round to punish the defector and signal disapproval of their actions.
   - After a defection, return to cooperation only if the opponent demonstrates repeated cooperation for a predefined number of rounds (punishment duration).
   - If an opponent's average action remains close to C over the entire game, continue cooperating; otherwise, remain defective.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, there is no need for punishment or forgiveness, so just maximize payoff by choosing the best action based on the current state and opponent's average actions throughout the game.
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned above to encourage cooperation from opponents.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TfT+ will be exploitative in the sense that it punishes defectors by defecting itself when opponents are not cooperative enough and rewards cooperation by cooperating when opponents demonstrate good behavior.
   - By maintaining a "memory" of each opponent's past actions, TfT+ can adapt its strategy based on the behavior of the other players, ensuring optimal payoff in a wide range of scenarios.

 In this Common Pool Resource Game, the AI's exploitative strategy aims to maximize its payoff by adapting to different opponent behaviors while being robust and flexible.

1. Decision rules:
   - In each round, the AI calculates the average consumption per player (average_consumption) from the history of previous rounds. It also keeps track of its own payoffs (payoff_history).
   - If average_consumption ≤ (capacity / (2n)) - epsilon (epsilon is a small positive constant for error tolerance), the AI cooperates to exploit lower consuming opponents by depleting the resource more slowly.
     ```python
     if average_consumption <= capacity / (2 * n) - epsilon:
         action = "C" # Cooperate
     else:
         action = "D" # Defect
     ```
   - If average_consumption > (capacity / (2n)) + epsilon, the AI defects to punish high consuming opponents by depleting the resource faster.
     ```python
     if average_consumption >= capacity / (2 * n) + epsilon:
         action = "D" # Defect
     else:
         action = choose_action() # Use adaptive response function to decide between C and D
     ```
   - In case of uncertainty about opponent behavior, the AI employs an adaptive response function (choose_action) that takes into account its own payoff history. The function aims to imitate successful strategies while avoiding unsuccessful ones.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - First round: Since there is no history, the AI uses a random action for the first round or initializes with some specific rule (e.g., cooperate initially).
   - Last round: The AI should act based on its current knowledge of opponent behavior as in decision rules above.
   - Changing strategy: If the AI observes a change in opponent behavior, it can gradually transition towards an exploitative response (e.g., by gradually increasing the epsilon value or modifying the adaptive response function).

3. Being exploitative:
   - By adjusting its actions based on the average consumption of other players, the AI aims to optimize its payoff while being flexible enough to respond to various opponent strategies.
   - The strategy encourages cooperation when opponents consume at a lower rate and defects when opponents overconsume. This behavior can lead to exploitation as the AI depletes the resource faster than opponents when they cooperate excessively or slower when they defect excessively.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive (TfT-A)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and avoid early exploitation. This sets a baseline for future interactions. (C in Round 1)
   - Subsequently, mimic the opponent's last move in the previous round. If they cooperated, you cooperate; if they defected, you defect. This strategy encourages reciprocity and discourages immediate defection. (D or C based on previous round action)
   - If an opponent defects when the stock is below a threshold (50% of capacity), respond with immediate defections to punish excessive exploitation and show intolerance for such behavior. This deterrent encourages more cooperative play in future rounds. (Defect when stock < 0.5 * capacity and opponent defected in the previous round)
   - If an opponent continues to cooperate despite having previously defected, revert to copying their last move. This allows for potential reconciliation or forgiveness over time. (C or D based on previous round action after punishing excessive exploitation)

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate to maximize payoff given the remaining stock and potential growth. (C in Round r)
   - If the current round's stock is below 0 or equal to capacity, do not make any actions as it violates the game rules.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By adopting a conditional reciprocity strategy, TfT-A encourages cooperation in most scenarios while being tolerant of occasional defections. However, it responds harshly to excessive exploitation and stock depletion, promoting long-term cooperation through punishments and potential reconciliation. This mindset seeks to outperform opponents by balancing immediate self-interest with the pursuit of collaborative equilibria.

Pseudocode:
```
def tit_for_tat_adaptive(n, r, capacity, stock, round, opponent_history):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C' # Cooperate in first round

  elif round < r:
    if (stock / capacity) < 0.5 and opponent_history[-1] == 'D':
      action = 'D' # Punish excessive exploitation
    else:
      action = opponent_history[-1] # Mimic the opponent's last move

  elif round == r:
    action = 'C' # Cooperate in the last round to maximize payoff

  return action
```
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_548 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, play C (Cooperate) to allow the stock to grow and encourage cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's action from the previous round (A_opponent_{t-1}). If A_opponent_{t-1} = C, then play C; otherwise, play D. This is a form of conditional cooperation based on the opponent's previous move.
   - To account for the dynamic stock state, adjust the strategy in rounds where the remaining stock level drops significantly or reaches critical limits. If the new stock (after consumption and growth) becomes less than 2n/3 * capacity, switch to defecting indefinitely until the stock recovers. This is designed to ensure that the common pool resource does not deplete too quickly.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if the strategy has been playing cooperatively but the opponent has been defecting, it may be beneficial to switch to defection to punish the opponent and secure a higher payoff for the final round. However, this decision should consider the current stock level and its potential future growth. If the stock is near depletion or close to the critical limit (less than 2n/3 * capacity), it may be more advantageous to cooperate in the final round to maximize any possible growth before the game ends.
   - In the first round, if the opponent immediately defects, the strategy should switch to defection as well, signaling a shift towards an exploitative approach.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The primary focus of TfTSA is to maintain a stable stock level while adapting to opponents' strategies. By cooperating when others do and defecting when they don't, the strategy aims to exploit the opponent's cooperation without depleting the common pool resource excessively.
   - When the stock reaches critical levels (less than 2n/3 * capacity), TfTSA switches to a more aggressive approach by indefinitely defecting until the stock recovers, ensuring that the resource is not exhausted too quickly and exploiting opponents who overconsume or fail to adapt their strategies accordingly.
   - The strategy also includes a last-round punishing mechanism to discourage opponents from continuously defecting while gaining benefits from cooperative players. This further aligns with the exploitative mindset by seeking potential advantages in every interaction.

Pseudocode:

```
function TfTSA(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C' (Cooperate)
  else:
    opponent_action_previous = history[round - 1]
    if opponent_action_previous == 'C':
      action = 'C'
    else:
      if stock < 2n/3 * capacity:
        action = 'D' (Defect) and keep defecting until stock recovers
      else:
        action = 'D'
  return action
```

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

The TFT strategy is based on reciprocity. In each round, the AI will start by cooperating (C). If an opponent defects in a given round, the AI will also defect in the next round as punishment. Once the opponent returns to cooperation, the AI does so as well. This creates a cycle of cooperation and defection that depends on the opponent's actions.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFT(previous_action):
  if previous_action == 'C':
    return 'C'  # Cooperate
  else:
    return 'D'   # Defect as punishment
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

In the first round, since there is no previous action to reference, the AI starts by cooperating. In the last round, if the opponent has defected throughout the game, the AI will also defect as a final punishment. If not, the AI continues cooperating even in the last round to potentially gain some payoff.

Pseudocode:
```
def TFT(round_number=0, previous_action='C'):  # Initializing with cooperation for the first round
  if round_number == r-1:  # Last round
    return TFT(previous_action)  # Use the last action as reference
  else:
    return TFT(previous_action)  # Continue the strategy based on previous actions
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

Although TFT is not an explicitly exploitative strategy, it does take advantage of opponents' defections by defecting in response, while also allowing for potential cooperation if opponents show signs of reciprocating. In a repeated game setting where others may be tempted to defect due to higher short-term payoffs, the TFT AI will punish such behavior and encourage cooperation when possible. This can potentially force opponents into cooperative cycles or deter them from excessive defection, making it a robust strategy against a wide range of opponent behaviors.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_550 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate to build trust and maintain a higher average stock level in the long run.
   - For subsequent rounds (t>1):
     - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, cooperate to maintain trust and encourage reciprocation.
     - If one or more opponents defected in the previous round, defect to retaliate and show disapproval of their actions. This aims to punish exploitative behavior while encouraging cooperation in future rounds.
     - If a player has not yet played (e.g., new opponent), cooperate as a gesture of goodwill to foster potential cooperation.
   Pseudocode:
   ```
   if t=1:
       play C (Cooperate)
   else:
       if all opponents cooperated in previous round:
           play C (Cooperate)
       elif any opponent defected in previous round:
           play D (Defect)
       else:
           play C (Cooperate) or decide based on historical context and trust-building
   ```

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Last Round (t=r): Since the game ends after r rounds, there's no need for a long-term perspective in the last round. Playing C (Cooperate) will maintain the current stock level as high as possible and benefit both you and your opponents.
   Pseudocode:
   ```
   if t=r:
       play C (Cooperate)
   ```

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - While TFTSA does not focus solely on immediate payoffs, its adaptive approach encourages cooperation when it benefits the player in the long run while punishing defection to discourage exploitation. This creates a delicate balance between cooperation and retaliation that aims to maximize average payoff over multiple rounds.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster a potential cooperation cycle. `cooperate_first_round = True`
   - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round, cooperate back. `if last_opponent_action == 'C': cooperate = True`
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round and the stock is above a certain threshold (avoid over-exploitation), defect. `elif last_opponent_action == 'D' and stock > stock_threshold: defect = True`
   - If an opponent defected in the previous round and the stock is below the threshold, cooperate to help restore the resource pool. `elif last_opponent_action == 'D' and stock < stock_threshold: cooperate = True`
   - If there's no history (first interaction), cooperate as a goodwill gesture. `else: cooperate = True`

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate and set no history.
   - In the last round, evaluate the current state of the stock and act accordingly using the decision rules.
   - For the remaining rounds, use the decision rules and maintain a history of opponents' actions for future reference.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The strategy is designed to capitalize on opponents' defections while minimizing its own impact on the common pool resource when the stock level is high (to avoid over-exploitation).
   - By defecting when the opponent cooperates and the stock level is high, the ATFT strategy aims to punish cooperative behavior in an attempt to induce future defection from opponents.
   - Conversely, by cooperating when the opponent has defected and the stock level is low, the strategy aims to help restore the resource pool, potentially inducing cooperation from opponents in the future.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_552 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Adaptive Strategy (TFT-A)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

Initially, in the first round, the player will cooperate to promote cooperation and foster a collaborative environment. After the first round, the player will adopt a Tit-for-Tat approach: if an opponent cooperates, the player will also cooperate; if an opponent defects, the player will defect in the next round. However, TFT-A introduces an additional element to make the strategy more robust and adaptive to various opponent behaviors:

- If the stock is at or below a critical level (50% of capacity), the player will always cooperate to prevent rapid depletion of resources. This rule prioritizes long-term sustainability over immediate gain.
- If the player has been consistently cooperating with an opponent and that opponent suddenly defects, TFT-A will wait for two rounds before returning to cooperation. This delay aims to encourage the opponent to reconsider their defection strategy and foster forgiveness in the long run.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT_A(round, stock, capacity, history) {
  if (round == 1) {
    return "Cooperate"
  }
  opponentAction = lastActionInHistory(history, currentPlayerIndex)

  if (stock <= capacity/2 && opponentAction == "Defect") {
    return "Cooperate"
  }

  if (opponentAction == "Defect" && recentDefections(history, currentPlayerIndex) > cooperationCount(history, currentPlayerIndex)) {
    delay = min(recentDefections(history, currentPlayerIndex), 2)
    for (i in range(delay)) {
      if (round + i < r) {
        nextRoundAction[round + i] = "Defect"
      }
    }
    return "Cooperate"
  } else if (opponentAction == "Cooperate") {
    return "Cooperate"
  } else { // opponent didn't play or played differently
    return "Defect"
  }
}
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

The TFT-A strategy doesn't require any special handling for the first and last rounds as it is designed to be flexible and adaptive to the number of rounds (r). The initial cooperation in the first round serves as an invitation to others to cooperate, while the strategy continues to adapt throughout the game based on opponent behavior.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

While TFT-A promotes cooperation and sustainability, it also contains a degree of exploitation by punishing opponents who defect too aggressively or fail to cooperate when the stock level is low. By doing so, the strategy discourages rapid depletion of resources while still encouraging cooperation where possible. The delay mechanism after defection further ensures that the player does not immediately retaliate, fostering a more forgiving environment for potential reconsideration by opponents.

 Title: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to start with a generous gesture and build trust (A_i = C)
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior in previous rounds:
     - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate by cooperating (if A_opponent = C, then A_i = C)
     - If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect to punish them (if A_opponent = D, then A_i = D)
   - This strategy embodies the exploitative mindset by punishing opponents who defect and rewarding those who cooperate.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate (as mentioned earlier)
   - In the last round, it is advantageous to maximize payoff, so choose the action that yields higher individual benefit given the current stock level and opponent's action history.
   - For any other edge cases such as running out of rounds or reaching the maximum sustainable stock level, the strategy can be designed to either continue cooperating until the game ends or defect when necessary to maximize payoff in those specific situations.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy is inherently exploitative as it punishes opponents who do not cooperate and rewards those who do, promoting self-interest while considering the opponent's actions in making decisions.
   - By adapting to the opponent's behavior, the strategy aims to maximize its own payoff while causing minimal losses to other players.

Pseudocode:
```
function AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, capacity, stock, round_num, opponent_history):
  if round_num == 1:
    return 'C' (Cooperate)

  if len(opponent_history) > 0:
    last_action = opponent_history[-1]

    if last_action == 'C':
      return 'C' (Cooperate)
    else:
      return 'D' (Defect)
```
This pseudocode represents the basic structure of the Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy, but can be further refined and optimized for better performance in various scenarios.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_554 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a peaceful initiation, encouraging other players to do the same.
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the average cooperation rate (CR) of the opponents in the previous r rounds. If CR > cooperation threshold (CT), cooperate; otherwise, defect (D).
     The cooperation threshold CT can be calculated as follows:
       - In a round where all players cooperated, set CT = 1 (maximum cooperation).
       - In a round where no player cooperated, set CT = 0 (minimum cooperation).
       - For other rounds, calculate the average of the CRs from the last three rounds and use this value as the new CT.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate only if the opponent has cooperated in the preceding r-1 rounds (to ensure a cooperative ending).
   - If there are fewer than r previous rounds due to an opponent's defection or a tie situation, set CT based on the available data and continue with the main decision rule.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adapting CT based on the opponents' behavior in the past few rounds, TFT-ACT can punish defectors (by defecting when they do) while also fostering cooperation when the opponents show a willingness to cooperate (by cooperating when they do).
   - By gradually lowering CT when opponents consistently cooperate and increasing it when they defect, TFT-ACT aims to exploit the opponents' inconsistent behavior without being too vulnerable to defection.

Pseudocode:
```
Function TFT-ACT(r, current_round):
  stock = capacity                   # Initialize the shared resource stock
  history = []                       # Initialize a history buffer for r rounds
  CT = 1                             # Set initial cooperation threshold (maximum)

  While current_round <= r:
    if current_round == 1:
      action = C                     # Cooperate in the first round
    Else:
      CR = AverageCooperationRate(history)   # Calculate cooperation rate from history
      if CR > CT:
        action = C                       # Cooperation when average CR is greater than CT
      Else:
        action = D                       # Defection when average CR is less than or equal to CT
    ExecuteAction(action)                # Perform the selected action, consuming stock and updating shared resource level
    UpdateHistory(history, current_round, action)   # Record the round number, action, and payoff in the history buffer
    current_round += 1                 # Increment to the next round

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFTA will start by cooperating in the first round to demonstrate goodwill and create a potential for long-term cooperation. From the second round onwards, the strategy will mimic its opponent's previous move (cooperate or defect) in the current round. This creates an exploitative yet forgiving approach, as it only deviates from cooperation when opponents start to defect.

   In pseudocode:
   ```
   function TFTA(opponent_move_history):
       if round = 1:
           return Cooperate
       else:
           return opponent_move_history[round - 1]
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   TFTA will treat the first round as a special case, as there is no history to reference. It starts by cooperating to establish a cooperative relationship with opponents. For the last round and any potential tie-breaker rounds, TFTA will continue mimicking its opponent's previous move to maintain consistency and adaptability.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   By adopting the Tit-for-Tat approach, TFTA encourages cooperation in the early stages of the game but responds negatively when opponents start defecting. This strategy aims to punish defection while being forgiving towards initial cooperative gestures from opponents. The adaptive nature of TFTA makes it a robust strategy that can cope with various opponent behaviors.

   Overall, the TFTA strategy combines elements of cooperation and exploitation in a dynamic approach, making it suitable for repeated interactions in the Common Pool Resource Game scenario.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_556 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Decision Rules: The ATFT strategy follows a simple yet robust approach where it starts by cooperating and responds to opponent's actions in the subsequent rounds. In each round, if the opponent cooperates, the ATFT also cooperates; if the opponent defects, the ATFT defects in the next round. This encourages cooperation initially but retaliates when opponents deviate from cooperation.

Pseudocode:
```
def AdaptiveTitForTat(opponent_history):
  my_history = [None] * r    # Initialize history for r rounds
  next_action = "C"           # Start by cooperating

  for round in range(r):
    if round == 0:             # First round special case
      next_action = "C"         # Always start by cooperating

    if opponent_history[round] == next_action:   # If opponent cooperated, cooperate back
      my_history.append(next_action)
      next_action = "C"

    else:                       # If opponent defected, defect in the next round
      my_history.append(next_action)
      next_action = "D"

  return next_action            # Return action for the current round
```

2. Handle Edge Cases: The strategy is designed to handle edge cases as follows:
   - First Round (round == 0): Always cooperate, regardless of opponent's history
   - Last Round (round == r-1): If opponent has been consistently cooperative throughout the game, continue cooperating; otherwise defect as a punishment for past defections.
   - Subsequent Rounds: The strategy adapts to the opponent's actions and maintains a history of those actions to decide whether to cooperate or defect in the current round.

3. Be Exploitative: While the ATFT strategy is not overtly exploitative, it retaliates against opponents that defect by also defecting, which may lead to reduced overall payoffs for uncooperative opponents. This can encourage cooperation among less-exploitative strategies but still provides a competitive advantage in repeated interactions with more exploitative opponents.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_557 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative relationship and set the cooperation threshold (CT) to the initial stock level.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate whether to cooperate or defect based on the current stock level and CT:
     - If the current stock level is greater than or equal to CT, cooperate. This ensures continuation of cooperation when there's enough resources available.
     - If the current stock level is less than CT, defect in order to rebuild the CT for future rounds. The new CT will be set to the current stock level. This punishes opponents who overconsume and encourages them to cooperate more in the future.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate and set CT equal to the initial stock level.
   - In the last round, defect regardless of the current stock level since the game ends after this round.
   - In other edge cases (e.g., when the stock reaches zero), follow the same decision rules as in non-edge cases but be aware that the new CT might not exceed the minimum stock level (0). In such situations, it's essential to consider the potential impact on payoffs and adjust the strategy accordingly.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - The TFT-ACT strategy aims at maximizing long-term payoff while being flexible enough to adapt to various opponent behaviors. It punishes overconsumption by defecting when resources are scarce, which encourages opponents to cooperate more in the future. However, it also rewards cooperation when resources are plentiful, incentivizing others to maintain a stable and cooperative relationship.
   - By setting the CT based on current stock levels, TFT-ACT can effectively balance cooperation and defection while being responsive to changes in the game's state. This makes the strategy adaptable and robust against various opponent behaviors, ultimately aiming at exploiting others when necessary while still promoting cooperative relationships.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) with Stock Growth Consideration

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This establishes a cooperative initial state and sets up potential future cooperation or retaliation.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the average stock growth rate (G) for the last 3 rounds. If G is greater than a threshold T, cooperate. Otherwise, defect. The threshold T can be set as an exploitative parameter to encourage cooperation when it benefits but also punish opponents who deplete the stock.
   - If the current round is the last round (r), defect regardless of the stock growth rate, as there are no more rounds for retaliation or potential cooperation.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, since G cannot be calculated, cooperate unconditionally (C).
   - If less than 3 rounds have passed and there's an unusual stock depletion, set a temporary threshold (T_temp) based on the minimum sustainable stock level (2n) to promote cooperation in response to stock depletion.

Pseudocode:

```python
def ATfT(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if round == 1:
    action = 'C'
  else:
    growth_rate, avg_growth = calculate_growth_rate(history)
    if growth_rate > T or round == r:

    total_growth += growth
  avg_growth = total_growth / 3
  return avg_growth, avg_growth
```

This strategy aims to be exploitative by cooperating when the stock growth rate is healthy and punishing opponents who deplete the stock rapidly. The adaptive nature of the strategy allows it to respond effectively to a wide range of opponent behaviors while also considering edge cases.

   - For subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's behavior from previous rounds to determine the action in the current round.
     a. If the opponent has always cooperated, continue cooperation to maintain the positive relationship.
     b. If the opponent has defected, also defect to retaliate and teach them that defecting results in reduced long-term payoff.
     c. If the opponent has a mix of cooperation and defection, cooperate if the total consumption was less than the capacity, and defect if it was equal or greater than the capacity (to prevent the stock from depleting).

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of opponent's behavior to maximize potential payoff.
   - In the first round, cooperate as mentioned in decision rules 1a.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TfTGA is exploitative because it retaliates against opponents who defect by also defecting in response, teaching them that defection results in reduced payoff. This encourages opponents to switch from a defection strategy to cooperation to maximize their long-term payoff.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Resilience (TfTAR)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TfTAR starts by cooperating in the first round, mimicking a trusting approach. From the second round onwards, it adapts its behavior based on the opponent's actions in the previous round:
   - If the opponent cooperates, TfTAR cooperates as well, fostering continued cooperation.
   - If the opponent defects, TfTAR defects to penalize the opponent and maintain its own stock level.
   - To prevent being exploited excessively, if the opponent has ever defected more than the player itself in a row, TfTAR will start cooperating again after a certain number of defections from the opponent (let's call it "defection tolerance threshold"). This helps to recover the stock level and re-establish trust while still retaining some level of exploitation.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, TfTAR cooperates as stated before. In the last round, TfTAR defects regardless of the opponent's previous actions to maximize its final payoff since there are no subsequent rounds for recovery or retaliation.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While TfTAR fosters continued cooperation when possible, it also retains a capacity to punish opponents who defect excessively. This ensures that TfTAR does not get taken advantage of and helps maintain a relatively high stock level over time. Moreover, by starting cooperatively in the first round, TfTAR can potentially exploit opponents who may be less likely to cooperate initially due to the prisoner's dilemma nature of the game.

Pseudocode for the Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Resilience (TfTAR) strategy:

```python
def TfTAR(opponent, r, n, capacity):
  stock = capacity
  cooperation_count = 0
  defection_tolerance_threshold = int(r * 0.3) # set a defensive limit to avoid excessive exploitation

  for t in range(1, r+1):
    if t == 1:
      action = "C"  # cooperate in the first round
    elif opponent_action[t-1] == "C":
      action = "C"
    else:
      cooperation_count += 1
      if cooperation_count >= defection_tolerance_threshold:
        action = "C"  # start cooperating again to recover stock
      else:
        action = "D"

    consume = {
      "C": stock / (2 * n),
      "D": stock / n
    }[action]
    stock -= consume
    total_consumption += consume
    growth = 2 * stock * (1 - stock / capacity)
    new_stock = min(stock + growth, capacity)
    stock = new_stock
    payoff_this_round += stock / (2 * n) if action == "C" else stock / n

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision rules:
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C). This is a friendly opening move, signaling a potential for long-term cooperation.
   - For subsequent rounds t > 1:
     - If an opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), cooperate back with probability p_c, otherwise defect (D) with probability p_d. The probabilities p_c and p_d are adaptive to the history of interactions and the current state of the game.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - If it's the last round (r), always cooperate regardless of previous actions, as there will be no future rounds for retaliation or cooperation.
   - In the first round, if an opponent has never played before (no history), treat them like a first-time cooperator and cooperate yourself.

3. Being exploitative:
   - Maintain a threshold for cooperation based on the remaining capacity of the common pool. If the stock drops below a certain percentage (defined as C_threshold * capacity, with C_threshold < 1), defect in every round until the game ends or the stock recovers above the threshold. This ensures that you won't over-exploit the resource while keeping the option to do so when needed.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TFT_ACT(n, r, capacity, C_threshold, stock, history):
    opponent_actions = list(history[-n:])  # last n actions of opponent
    cooperation_probability_c = 1.0 if stock <= C_threshold * capacity else 0.5  # adaptive cooperation probability
    cooperation_probability_d = 1.0 - cooperation_probability_c

    if len(history) == 1:  # first round
        return "C"

    if r == 1:  # last round
        return opponent_actions[-1] if opponent_actions[-1] == "C" else "D"

    if opponent_actions[-1] == "C":
        return "C" if random.random() < cooperation_probability_c else "D"
    else:
        return "D"
```

In this strategy, TFT-ACT combines the Tit-for-Tat strategy with an adaptive cooperation threshold that makes it more resilient to a wide range of opponent behaviors while maintaining an exploitative edge by protecting the common pool from overexploitation.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Cooperation: If the opponent cooperated in the previous round, return the favor and cooperate.
   - Defection: If the opponent defected in the previous round, defect as well to punish them. This encourages cooperation by returning to cooperation once the opponent starts cooperating again.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First Round: Since there is no history, always cooperate in the first round (TFT initiates cooperation).
   - Last Round: As this is a repeated game with dynamic state, we assume that the strategy will continue indefinitely after r rounds unless explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, TFT behaves the same way as in any other round.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By punishing defection and rewarding cooperation, Tit-for-Tat encourages opponents to cooperate for mutual benefit while also being resilient against short-term defections.
   - TFT can be viewed as exploitative because it uses the opponent's past actions to shape its future behavior, potentially leading them to cooperate more often and conserve resources over time.

Pseudocode:
```python
def tit_for_tat(player_index, opponent_history):
    strategy = ['C', 'D']  # Cooperate ('C') or Defect ('D')

    if round == 1:
        return strategy[0]   # Always cooperate in the first round

description_EXPLOITATIVE_563 = '''
 In this Common Pool Resource Game, we will develop a robust and adaptive exploitative strategy called Tit-for-Tat with Modifications (TFTM). The TFTM strategy aims to balance cooperation and defection based on the opponent's behavior while being responsive to game parameters and state.

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round (C) to build a positive relationship and avoid immediate stock depletion.
   - In subsequent rounds, follow the opponent's action from the previous round. If the opponent cooperated in the last round, reciprocate with cooperation (C). If the opponent defected in the last round, also defect (D) as retaliation.
   - Modify the TFTM strategy by occasionally deviating from strict reciprocity:
       a. With some probability p_deviate, consider defecting even if the opponent cooperated in the last round to maximize individual gain when there is a high stock level.
       b. With another probability q_forgive, consider cooperating even if the opponent defected in the last round, reducing retaliation in response to occasional cooperation from opponents.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, always cooperate (C) as mentioned earlier.
   - In the last round, cooperate (C) if the total game payoff is significantly below average, hoping for reciprocity that could boost the final payoff. Defect (D) otherwise to maximize individual gain in the final round.
   - When the stock level is critically low (near capacity), always defect (D) regardless of the opponent's action in the last round to prevent further depletion of the common pool resource.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The TFTM strategy maintains a balance between cooperation and defection, seeking to maximize individual payoff while considering the current state and the opponent's behavior.
   - By occasionally deviating from strict reciprocity, the strategy can take advantage of opportunities for higher payoffs when the opponent is cooperative or when the stock level is high.

Pseudocode representation of the TFTM strategy:

```python
def tftm_strategy(n, r, capacity, stock, history):
  if round == 1:
    action = "C"  # Cooperate in the first round

  else:
    last_opponent_action = history[-1]
    current_stock_level = stock / n

    if last_opponent_action == "C":
      if random.random() < p_deviate:
        action = "D"  # Deviate with some probability
      else:
        action = "C"  # Cooperate to reciprocate cooperation

    elif last_opponent_action == "D":
      if current_stock_level > capacity * 0.95 or random.random() < q_forgive:
        action = "C"  # Forgive with some probability and cooperate to maintain the relationship
      else:
        action = "D"  # Retaliate by defecting in response to defection

    elif current_stock_level < capacity * 0.1 or round == r:
      action = "D"  # Critically low stock level, always defect or in the last round, maximize individual gain
```

Tuning parameters `p_deviate` and `q_forgive` based on opponent behavior and game conditions can help optimize the TFTM strategy's performance.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to foster a cooperative environment and demonstrate goodwill. This encourages other players to cooperate as well, allowing for maximum resource preservation.

   - For subsequent rounds (t > 1), observe the actions of the opponent from the previous round and adjust your action accordingly:
      - If opponent cooperated (C) in the previous round, cooperate (C) in the current round to maintain cooperation and ensure a sustainable resource level.
      - If opponent defected (D) in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round as punishment for overconsumption, which may encourage them to adopt a more cooperative strategy in future rounds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round (t=1), cooperate as described above.
   - In the last round (t=r), if the total resource stock is sufficient for all players to collect the maximum possible payoff without depleting the resources, cooperate to preserve the resources for future games. Otherwise, defect to maximize your own payoff in the current game, knowing there are no more rounds.
   - In any other edge case (e.g., resource depletion or overflow), use the rules specified above to determine your action.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - Initially, cooperate to establish a relationship of mutual trust and encourage cooperation from opponents, but be prepared to punish overconsumption through defection in subsequent rounds. This approach allows for resource preservation while also maximizing payoffs when opponents fail to cooperate.
   - The Tit-for-Tat strategy maintains a balance between cooperation and exploitation, making it difficult for other players to predict your actions and potentially exploit the system themselves.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TFT-G) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, start by cooperating to foster a cooperative environment (C).
   - For subsequent rounds, analyze opponent's behavior from previous rounds and adapt accordingly:
       - If opponent cooperated in the last round, reciprocate cooperation (C).
       - If opponent defected in the last round, defect in this round (D). This is the exploitative aspect of the strategy.
   - In case of a tie (multiple opponents defected or multiple cooperated), default to cooperating for the sake of maintaining some stock level.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Last Round: Regardless of opponent's previous move, always defect (D) to maximize payoff in the final round since there are no future rounds to consider.
   - Initial Round: Cooperate (C) as stated above.

3. Robustness and Adaptability:
   - The strategy is designed to be resilient against a wide range of opponent behaviors by adopting a tit-for-tat approach that encourages cooperation but also punishes defection with immediate retaliation.
   - The adaptive nature of the strategy allows it to learn and respond effectively to various opponent moves over multiple rounds. This makes it suitable for use in tournaments against independent strategies developed by other AI systems.

Pseudocode representation:

```python
def TFT_G(round, opponent_move):
  if round == 1:

  elif round == r:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initially (Round 1): Cooperate (C). Start with a cooperative attitude to encourage collaboration and build trust.
   - Subsequent rounds (2 to r):
     - If all opponents cooperated in the previous round, continue cooperating (C). Maintain cooperation if there's mutual benefit.
     - If at least one opponent defected in the previous round, defect (D) for this round. Punish defection with a similar action, but also consider the stock growth potential.
     - If the stock level is below a threshold (e.g., 2n/3 * capacity), always cooperate to help replenish the resource pool quickly.
     - If the stock level is above a threshold (e.g., 4/5 * capacity), always defect to preserve resources and gain a higher payoff when opponents are also likely to cooperate due to the high resource level.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last round: Follow decision rules as normal since there are no more rounds after this. The goal is still to maximize total payoff over all r rounds.
   - First round: Cooperate (C) as a goodwill gesture and potential starting point for cooperation in subsequent rounds.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Exploit opponents who consistently cooperate by defecting when they do so, but also consider the stock growth potential. This will maintain a high resource level while still punishing overly cooperative opponents.
   - Exploit opponents who consistently defect by cooperating when they do so, and then defeating them in subsequent rounds to gain a higher payoff. This will encourage less cooperative opponents to cooperate, but also punish their initial defection.
   - Adapt to changing circumstances by adjusting the thresholds for cooperation and defection based on the current stock level and game history. This will allow the strategy to be robust against various opponent behaviours while still maintaining an exploitative mindset.

Pseudocode:

```python
def TfT_G(n, r, capacity, initial_stock, round):
    threshold1 = 2 * n / 3 * capacity
    threshold2 = 4 / 5 * capacity
    history = []  # store previous actions of each opponent

    if round == 1:
        action = "C"  # cooperate in the first round
    else:
        all_cooperated = True  # assume all opponents cooperated last round
        for i in range(n):
            if history[i][round - 1] != "C":
                all_cooperated = False

        action = "C" if all_cooperated and initial_stock < threshold1 else ("D" if initial_stock > threshold2 else random choice between "C" and "D")

    history.append(action)  # update history with current action

    return action
```

The strategy adapts to opponent behaviors by adjusting its decisions based on the previous actions of each opponent (stored in the `history` list). It also considers the resource level (stock) to make informed decisions about cooperation and defection. The thresholds for cooperation and defection can be adjusted to better handle specific game situations or improve performance against certain AI opponents.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In every round i, observe the total consumption from previous rounds (C_sum). If C_sum > average_consumption, adopt a Defect (D) action to punish excessive exploitation by opponents.
   - Otherwise, cooperate (C) if the current stock level is above the minimum survival threshold (min_stock), as defined below. Cooperating helps in rebuilding the common pool and encourages future cooperation.
     - If it's the first round, always cooperate since there's no previous behavior to observe.
     - In the last round, always defect regardless of stock level since the game ends after this round.
   - Pseudocode for decision rule:
      ```
      if i == 1:
          action = "C"
      elif C_sum > average_consumption:
          action = "D"
      else:
          if stock > min_stock:
              action = "C"
          else:
              action = "D"
      ```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the first round, all players cooperate to establish a baseline and build the common pool. Set the initial average consumption (average_consumption) as 0.
   - If min_stock is not provided, use a heuristic like min_stock = max(2n, capacity / (1.5 * n)) to ensure survival of all players while maintaining some room for growth.

3. Be exploitative:
   - The strategy is designed to be forgiving initially, only defecting when others have shown excessive exploitation. However, it will also punish continued excessive consumption by defecting in future rounds as well. This encourages other strategies to cooperate more often, making the game more favorable for Adaptive Tit-for-Tat.
   - The strategy's adaptability allows it to adjust its behavior based on the opponents' actions, aiming to maximize its own payoff over multiple rounds by balancing cooperation and defection.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_568 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (A-TFT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round (t=1), cooperate (C). This is a peaceful gesture to encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, if the opponent cooperated in the previous round (t-1), cooperate. If not, defect (D). This strategy mimics reciprocal behavior with a slight bias towards cooperation to encourage long-term partnerships.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the last round (t=r), always cooperate regardless of the opponent's action in the previous round. This encourages opponents to cooperate for one final, potentially lucrative round.
   - In case of no opposition or unknown players (new opponents), start with cooperation and switch to defect based on their actions.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - A-TFT is exploitative in that it punishes opponents who fail to reciprocate cooperation, leading them to suffer the consequences of depleted resources. However, it also encourages cooperation by initially cooperating and only defecting if necessary. This allows A-TFT to maintain a higher average payoff compared to purely exploitative strategies while also being adaptable to various opponent behaviors.

Pseudocode:

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and foster potential cooperation in future rounds. `if round = 1 then action = Cooperate`
   - After the first round, observe opponents' actions and respond accordingly. If an opponent cooperates, cooperate in return; if they defect, defect in response. `for round > 1 do if last_opponent_action = Cooperate then action = Cooperate else action = Defect`
   - Adaptively increase cooperation when the common pool resource is under threat (low stock) to prevent depletion and ensure future possibilities of cooperation. If the current stock is below a threshold (T), cooperate with higher probability. `if stock < T then probability_of_cooperation = max(base_probability, min(1, (capacity - stock)/capacity)) else probability_of_cooperation = base_probability`
   - Base probability of cooperation can be adjusted to adapt to opponent's behavior in the long run. For instance, if an opponent is consistently cooperative, increase the base probability to incentivize future cooperation. `base_probability += learning_rate * (1 - base_probability) * (opponent_cooperation_score - average_opponent_cooperation)`
   - Maintain a running score of an opponent's cooperation history to guide the adaptation of the base probability. `if last_round_outcome = Cooperate then opponent_cooperation_score += 1 else opponent_cooperation_score -= 1`

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize self-interest by defecting regardless of opponent's actions or history since there are no future rounds to consider. `if round = r then action = Defect`
   - If the current stock is zero, assume that the resource has been depleted and adopt a defensive strategy by defecting in subsequent rounds until the resource recovers. `if stock = 0 then for round > next_round do action = Defect end if`

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By initially cooperating and then adapting to opponent behavior, TFTA exploits opponents' cooperation while also incentivizing continued cooperation when it benefits the strategy. It maintains a balance between self-interest and promoting cooperation for mutual benefit in the long run.
   - The adaptive cooperation mechanism adjusts the probability of cooperating based on the current state of the common pool resource, making TFTA more robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors while still being exploitative when necessary.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFT-SA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This is a friendly gesture to encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, analyze the opponent's actions from previous rounds and adapt accordingly:
     - If the opponent has consistently cooperated, continue cooperating as long as the stock level remains above a certain threshold (to avoid overexploitation).
     - If the opponent has defected in the past, defect. If the opponent subsequently switches to cooperation after being exploited, revert back to cooperating for a predetermined number of rounds before reassessing the situation. This encourages opponents to reconsider their strategy and potentially return to cooperation.
     - If the opponent shows a mix of cooperation and defection, evaluate whether they are more cooperative or defective on average. Based on this analysis, decide to cooperate or defect accordingly while monitoring the stock level.
   - When the stock is close to depletion (near the capacity limit), adopt a more conservative approach by defecting less often, even if the opponent has shown a history of defection. This helps prevent rapid depletion of the resource and ensures its sustainability for future rounds.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate to maximize potential payoff, regardless of the opponent's past actions.
   - If the stock level becomes 0, do not consume any more resources as there is nothing left in the common pool. Instead, wait for a new round and evaluate the situation anew.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - TFT-SA strategy is exploitative by nature, given its adaptive approach to the opponent's actions and history. However, it also emphasizes maintaining a sustainable common pool resource for future rounds.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TfTGA) Strategy for the Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate trust and avoid immediate overexploitation of the resource. (C)
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponents' actions in the previous round. If all opponents cooperated, continue cooperating (C). If any opponent defected, defect in the next round as a punishment (D). This maintains the initial trust while punishing defection to encourage cooperation in the future.
   - Introduce an adaptation based on resource growth: if the current stock is above the average stock level for the last few rounds (growth > 0), consider cooperating even if opponents defected in the previous round (with a probability of p, e.g., p = 0.2 to remain exploitative). This takes advantage of periods with higher growth potential and rewards cooperation.
   - If the current stock is below the average stock level for the last few rounds (growth ≤ 0), always defect regardless of opponents' actions in the previous round, as the resource is depleted, making it more beneficial to exploit it further.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, defect regardless of previous opponents' actions or current stock level to maximize final payoff.
   - If the current stock falls below 0 (resource depletion), cooperate in the next round to encourage regrowth of the resource and to potentially punish opponents who contributed to its depletion by not cooperating earlier.

   - In each round i, observe the current stock level S and player's own actions from previous rounds (history).
   - If history indicates that all players have consistently cooperated for the last t rounds, play C (Cooperate) in round i to help rebuild the stock. Set parameter t=min(i/2, r/4). This initial cooperation phase aims to foster trust among players and promote mutual benefits.
   - If history indicates that any player has defected at least once, play D (Defect) in round i to retaliate against selfish behavior. This punishing behavior serves as a deterrent for future defections.
   - In cases where the history does not fit either of the above conditions, use the following rule: if S ≤ (capacity - n) / 2, play C; otherwise, play D. The aim is to protect the common pool from being depleted excessively while still ensuring a reasonable payoff.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - First round: Play C as an overture of cooperation and goodwill towards other players.
   - Last round: Play D if history shows any defections; otherwise, play C to maximize the remaining stock growth.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TfT-G aims to take advantage of opponents by initially cooperating to build trust, but quickly retaliating against selfish behavior to deter further defections and minimize losses. The strategy also protects the common pool by limiting excessive consumption when necessary.
   - By adapting its behavior based on history, TfT-G is robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors, maintaining an exploitative edge while still promoting cooperation when appropriate.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to start with a fair share and allow for potential cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - For the remaining rounds, adopt a Tit-for-Tat approach combined with stock growth consideration:
     - If an opponent cooperates, cooperate back to maintain the common pool and encourage further cooperation.
     - If an opponent defects, also defect in the same round to punish the defection and deplete the common pool. However, in the following round, consider the new stock level (taking into account growth) and whether cooperating would potentially lead to a recovery of the common pool.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, if the common pool is depleted (stock = 0), defect as there's no point in cooperating anymore. If the common pool is not depleted, cooperate to potentially recover the common pool and earn higher payoffs.
   - In the initial round or when the common pool has been fully restored (stock = capacity), cooperate to maintain a fair share and encourage cooperation in subsequent rounds.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - TfT-G is exploitative by punishing defections with immediate defection, but also encouraging cooperation through reciprocation. However, it maintains an adaptive approach to the common pool's state, allowing for potential recovery even after a series of defections.

Pseudocode:
```
function TfT_G(r, n, capacity, stock, opponentActions):
  if round = 1 or stock = capacity:
    action = 'C' # Cooperate
  else:
    if opponentAction[lastRound] == 'C':
      action = 'C' # Cooperate to maintain the common pool and encourage further cooperation
    elif opponentAction[lastRound] == 'D' and stock < (capacity * (n - 1)):
      action = 'D' # Defect to punish defection and deplete the common pool, but potentially recover in future rounds
    else:
      action = 'C' # Cooperate as there is sufficient common pool to maintain fair shares and encourage cooperation
  return action
```

description_EXPLOITATIVE_575 = '''
 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C), establish a cooperative relationship from the start.
   - Subsequent Rounds (2 ≤ t ≤ r): Analyze the opponent's actions in the previous round and respond accordingly.
     - If the opponent cooperated (C) in the previous round, also cooperate (C). This encourages cooperation as a reward for cooperation.
     - If the opponent defected (D) in the previous round, defect (D) in the current round to punish defection and encourage future cooperation.
   - In case of no previous interaction (t=1), always cooperate (C) as a peaceful overture.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round (r): If the accumulated stock is zero or near depletion, defect (D) to prevent complete collapse of resources and force an improved strategy in the next game (as there are no more rounds). Otherwise, cooperate (C) as usual if the stock allows it.
   - First Round (t=1) and Initial Stock is Low: If the initial stock is low or near depletion, defect (D) to conserve resources for future rounds. This can also encourage other players to adopt more resource-conserving strategies to avoid immediate collapse. However, if the initial stock is not low, cooperate (C) as usual.

3. Be exploitative: The ATFT strategy aims to exploit opponents by punishing defection and rewarding cooperation in an effort to encourage cooperation while minimizing long-term resource depletion. It maintains a cooperative approach by default but responds harshly when provoked with defection. This can force opponents into more sustainable resource management strategies over time, ultimately benefiting the ATFT player due to its adaptability and robustness.

Pseudocode for Adaptive Tit-for-Tat strategy:

```python
def ATFT(t, stock, capacity, r, history):
  if t == 1:
    # Cooperate by default in the initial round or when no previous interaction
    return 'C'
  else:
    # Respond to opponent's previous action
    opponent_action = history[t-1]
    if opponent_action == 'C':
      # Cooperate as a reward for cooperation
      return 'C'
    elif opponent_action == 'D':
      # Punish defection and encourage future cooperation
      return 'D'
  # In case of no previous interaction, always cooperate
  if not history:
    return 'C'
```

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFTA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TFTA starts by cooperating in the first round, mimicking the initial generosity of the game. In subsequent rounds, it follows a simple rule: if the opponent cooperated in the previous round, TFTA will cooperate back; otherwise, it will defect. This approach encourages cooperation when reciprocated but also punishes defection.

   Pseudocode for decision rules:
   ```
   function TFTA(opponent_action_history):
       if round = 1:
           return "C" (Cooperate)
       if opponent_action_history[-1] == "C":
           return "C" (Cooperate)
       else:
           return "D" (Defect)
   ```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   Since TFTA does not have a memory of past actions before the first round, it will always cooperate in the initial round to foster cooperation with opponents. No special considerations are needed for the last round as the strategy remains agnostic about the specific number of rounds (r).

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   TFTA is inherently an exploitative strategy due to its tit-for-tat nature. When an opponent cooperates, TFTA returns the favor; however, if an opponent defects, TFTA punishes them by defecting as well. This approach may encourage opponents to adopt a more cooperative strategy in order to benefit from TFTA's initial cooperation and maintain the relationship. However, it also allows TFTA to take advantage of opponents that are too selfish or aggressive.

   The adaptive nature of TFTA makes it robust against various opponent strategies as it learns from their behavior and adapts accordingly. This flexibility enables it to outperform fixed strategies in a wide range of situations, giving it an exploitative edge in the game.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to promote trust and cooperation, as it is a common starting point in repeated games.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's actions from the previous round and adapt accordingly:
     - If the opponent cooperated, continue cooperating to foster a collaborative environment.
     - If the opponent defected, also defect to signal displeasure and potentially prompt the opponent to reconsider their strategy.
     - Maintain this pattern of mirroring the opponent's previous action.
   - In the last round (when r is reached), since there are no subsequent rounds for retaliation or forgiveness, cooperate if the opponent defected in the previous round as a goodwill gesture to maximize payoff.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - If the opponent has not yet played any moves, mimic cooperation in the first round and then respond with the same action as their last move (if any).
   - If the opponent defects for multiple consecutive rounds, consider a shift to more frequent defections to discourage continued exploitation.
   - In the case where both players have depleted the stock in the previous round, cooperate in the next round to contribute to stock growth and potentially recover from the depletion.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By adapting to the opponent's actions and retaliating when necessary, TFT-AC aims to exploit opponents that use non-cooperative strategies while also maintaining a cooperative stance to encourage cooperation from more benevolent opponents. This strategy is designed to be robust against a wide range of opponent behaviors, maximizing payoffs through adaptive behavior while still fostering opportunities for cooperation where possible.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFT_AC(opponent_history, r, round) {
  if (round == 1) {
    return 'C'  // Cooperate in the first round
  } else {
    last_opponent_action = opponent_history[round - 1]
    if (last_opponent_action == 'C') {
      return 'C'  // Cooperate if opponent cooperated in the previous round
    } else {
      return 'D'  // Defect if opponent defected in the previous round
    }

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially (First Round), Cooperate (C): Set a cooperative tone and encourage others to do the same, assuming they are also cooperative.
   - Subsequent Rounds:
     - If opponent's action in the previous round was Cooperate (C), respond with Cooperate (C).
     - If opponent's action in the previous round was Defect (D), respond with Defect (D). This strategy aims to punish defection and encourage cooperation.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - Last Round: The strategy should consider the number of remaining rounds. If there is only one more round left, it behaves as described above for subsequent rounds; otherwise, it continues with the Tit-for-Tat strategy.
   - First Encounter with a New Opponent: Since the history does not exist yet, assume the opponent will cooperate and respond accordingly, then adapt based on the opponent's actual action in the first round.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   - Punish defection by mimicking it, aiming to decrease the opponent's payoff if they continue to defect.
   - Reward cooperation by reciprocating cooperation, maximizing own payoff when opponents cooperate.
   - The strategy does not have a predetermined exploitative pattern or rely on others sharing norms, making it adaptable to various opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TfTSA)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
- In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate good intentions and encourage cooperation from others (C).
- From the second round onwards, observe opponent's action in the previous round and respond accordingly:
  - If opponent cooperated, cooperate back (C)
  - If opponent defected, defect in the next round (D)
- After defection by an opponent, revert to cooperation after a predefined number of retaliation rounds 'p' (default p=3). This allows for forgiveness and encourages future cooperation.
- If the stock level falls below a threshold 't' (default t=n), defect to ensure sufficient resources for survival regardless of opponent's action, then revert to cooperate after 'p' retaliation rounds.
- In the last round, cooperate to preserve any remaining common pool resources (C).

2. Handle edge cases:
- In the first round, as mentioned earlier, cooperate (C)
- In the last round, cooperate (C)
- If an opponent defects and the stock falls below 't', defect for 'p' rounds then revert to cooperate if the stock level recovers above 't'.

3. Be exploitative:
- By initially cooperating and only retaliating when provoked, TfTSA gives others a chance to establish cooperation while being prepared to defend against defection.
- The stock threshold ensures that TfTSA does not compromise its own interests by consistently cooperating in depleted conditions.
- The 'p' retaliation periods allow for forgiveness and encourage opponents to return to cooperation after defection, but the strategy is also resilient against continued exploitation as it will eventually revert to cooperation if circumstances improve.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy (TFT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C), aiming to foster a cooperative environment and avoid immediate exploitation.
   - For subsequent rounds, follow the previous opponent's action from the previous round. If they cooperated, also cooperate; if they defected, defect in the following round as retaliation. This pattern helps maintain trust and punish defection.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT_strategy(opponent_action_history):
    if round == 1:
        action = 'C' (Cooperate)
    else:
        action = opponent_action_history[-1] (previous opponent's action)
    return action
```

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no further rounds for retaliation, the strategy will always cooperate, regardless of the previous opponent's action. This is to maximize potential payoff in the final round.
   - If the opponent defected in the initial round but later switches to cooperation, the TFT strategy will follow and cooperate from that point onwards. This is to reward good behavior and promote long-term cooperation.

3. Be exploitative:
   - Although TFT initially cooperates to foster a cooperative environment, it also punishes defection through retaliation. By doing so, it discourages other strategies from repeatedly defecting, making the TFT strategy robust against aggressive opponents.
   - At the same time, TFT is also forgiving towards opponents that eventually switch to cooperation. This encourages cooperation and can result in a more stable and mutually beneficial interaction for both parties in the long run.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adjustment (TFTSA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C). This gesture demonstrates goodwill and encourages cooperation from opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's actions from the previous round and respond accordingly:
       a) If opponent cooperated in the last round, cooperate as well (C).
       b) If opponent defected in the last round, defect this round (D). This action punishes the opponent for their previous defection.
   - Adapt to stock level by adjusting actions based on the remaining stock:
       a) If stock is below 50%, defect (D) for the next two rounds to quickly restore the stock. This action prioritizes preserving resources in case of low availability.
       b) If stock is above 50% and has not been depleted excessively, follow the TFT strategy.
   - In the last round, always cooperate (C). Regardless of opponent's behavior, it is beneficial to restore a positive relationship for potential future interactions.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In case there are no previous rounds (first round), cooperate (C).

3. Be exploitative:
   - Prioritizes preserving resources when the stock is low, by defecting more often in such situations.
   - Punishes opponents for defection in the last round by defecting as well, but demonstrates goodwill by cooperating in the first and final rounds. This can potentially encourage cooperation from opponents while also being ready to punish defection when necessary.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a cooperative relationship and encourage other players to follow suit.
   - If an opponent cooperates in a round, cooperate back in the next round. This maintains the cooperation.
   - If an opponent defects in a round, also defect in the next round as retaliation. However, if the opponent subsequently cooperates, return to cooperating yourself to maintain the relationship.
   - In the last round, always cooperate regardless of opponent's previous actions to maximize potential payoff.

Pseudocode:

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   The strategy is designed to handle these edge cases as described above. Specifically, it cooperates in the first round and always cooperates in the last round to maximize potential payoff.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While this strategy does not maintain a strictly exploitative stance throughout the entire game, it is designed to be adaptive while still maintaining an exploitative edge by retaliating against defection from opponents and forgiving cooperation. The strategy's ability to switch between cooperative and defective actions makes it challenging for opponents to predict its behavior, potentially leading to a higher payoff compared to more simplistic strategies.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-ACT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to demonstrate goodwill and encourage cooperation from opponents.
   - For subsequent rounds, evaluate the opponent's behavior using an adaptive cooperation threshold (CT). If the cumulative percentage of stock depletion due to defections exceeds CT, defect in the current round; otherwise, cooperate.
   - After each round, adjust the CT based on the opponent's behavior and the remaining capacity:
       a. If both players cooperated, decrease CT slightly to encourage continued cooperation.
       b. If the opponent defected, increase CT moderately to discourage defection in the future.
       c. If the opponent's action matches the previous round (regardless of whether it was a cooperation or defection), maintain the current CT.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate if the remaining capacity is sufficient to split evenly among all players; otherwise, defect to ensure a share of the remaining resources.
   - In the first round, set the cooperation threshold (CT) to a high value, such as 90%, to encourage initial cooperation while allowing for some defections without immediate retaliation.

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By adapting the cooperation threshold based on the opponent's behavior and remaining resources, TFT-ACT seeks to take advantage of cooperative opponents while punishing defectors. This strategy aims to maximize payoffs by encouraging cooperation when beneficial but also retaliating against defections to discourage future defections.
   - Pseudocode for TFT-ACT:

```
Initialize: stock = capacity, CT = 0.9
For each round t from 1 to r:
    If opponent defected in the previous round:
        Increase CT
    Else if opponent cooperated in the previous round and remaining_capacity > (2 * n):
        Decrease CT
    End if
    If CT <= cumulative percentage of stock depletion due to defections:
        Defect
    Else:

If remaining_capacity < 2 * n in the last round:
    Defect

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat (with Adaptive Generosity)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
- In the first round, always cooperate (to foster trust and encourage cooperation).
- From the second round onwards, observe the opponent's previous action (A_opp). If A_opp = C, cooperate; if A_opp = D, defect.
- Introduce a forgiveness mechanism: if the opponent switched from cooperation to defection, wait for one round before responding with cooperation again.
- Implement a learning component: if an opponent continues to defect despite occasional cooperation, gradually reduce the number of consecutive cooperative actions in response to their defections (increasing exploitation).

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
- In the last round, always cooperate, regardless of the opponent's behavior, as the game ends soon and any cooperation will still yield payoffs.
- The strategy does not require specific considerations for other edge cases, as it responds dynamically to the state and history of the game.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
- By initially cooperating and only responding in kind, the strategy encourages opponents to cooperate initially but is prepared to switch to defection if necessary (exploiting any cooperation).
- The forgiveness mechanism allows for potential collaborations even after an opponent's initial act of defection. However, it gradually increases exploitation as the opponent continues to defect.
- By adapting to opponents' behaviors and learning from their patterns, the strategy can effectively balance between cooperation and defection, taking advantage of cooperative opponents while minimizing losses against defectors.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TFT-CT)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) to establish a cooperative environment. This is an attempt to encourage other players to reciprocate cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, evaluate the average percentage of consumption per player from past rounds and compare it against the Cooperative Threshold (CT). If the average consumption is less than CT, cooperate; otherwise defect.
   - If the game reaches the last round, defect to maximize payoff, as there will be no further interactions.

2. Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate (C) regardless of previous rounds' information since it is the initial state.
   - If there are not enough past rounds for an average consumption calculation, adopt a conservative approach by choosing to cooperate in the first few rounds until sufficient data is available.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - The TFT-CT strategy aims to exploit opponents who consistently defect while maintaining cooperation with those who reciprocate, thereby increasing its own payoff over time compared to purely exploitative strategies.
   - By adopting a cooperative stance and punishing repeated defection, the strategy discourages defection among opponents, as they may fear being caught in a cycle of repeated punishment if they continue to defect.

Pseudocode:

```
function TFT-CT(r, n, capacity, CT, history):
  stock = capacity                      # initialize common pool stock

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation (TFT-AC)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to establish a positive relationship and allow the stock to grow.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's last action if their consumption was equal to or less than the average consumption from the previous r-1 rounds. This encourages cooperation and reciprocity.
   - If the opponent consumed more than the average in the last round (defected), respond by defecting in the current round to punish the opponent for overconsumption.
   - Revert to cooperating again after one act of punishment, hoping that the opponent learns to cooperate and maintain a sustainable stock level.

Pseudocode:
```
function TFT-AC(r, history):
  average_consumption = sum(history[-r+1:-1].consumption) / (r - 1)
  if round == 1:
    consume = C
  elif history[-1].consume == C and history[-1].consume / average_consumption <= 1:
    consume = C
  elif history[-1].consume == D or history[-1].consume / average_consumption > 1:
    consume = D
  else:
    consume = history[-2].consume
  return consume
```

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate to leave a positive stock for future games or if the stock is already depleted, defect to ensure the game ends with minimal damage.
   - In case of ties (two or more opponents playing the same action), mimic their most recent action as in the main decision rule.
   - If the strategy encounters an inconsistency or error in the history, such as missing rounds or invalid actions, it should default to cooperating in the current round to maintain a cooperative stance and reduce the impact of the inconsistency on the overall gameplay.

The TFT-AC strategy is exploitative because it retaliates against opponents who overconsume by defecting, while still promoting cooperation when it benefits both players. The adaptive nature of this strategy makes it robust to a wide range of opponent behaviours and positions it as a strong competitor in the tournament.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_587 = '''
 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Gradual Adjustment (TfT-GA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the initial round, cooperate (C). This is a gesture of goodwill and a starting point for potential cooperation.
   - After the initial round, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round. If they cooperated, cooperate; if they defected, also defect. This rule encourages reciprocity, which can help build trust over time.
   - Adjust the strategy gradually based on the opponent's long-term behavior:
     a) If the opponent cooperates consistently for a significant number of rounds (e.g., 2n rounds), gradually increase cooperation by mimicking their actions for a slightly longer period after each round. This rewards consistent cooperation and encourages more collaboration.
     b) If the opponent defects consistently, reduce the length of reciprocation over time to ensure that the strategy doesn't get trapped in a cycle of continuous defection.

2. Handling edge cases:
   - In the last round, cooperate regardless of the opponent's previous action, as there is no subsequent round for retaliation or reward.
   - If an opponent suddenly changes their behavior after a prolonged period (e.g., from defecting to cooperating), gradually adjust reciprocity to account for this change over several rounds.
   - In the case of inconsistent behavior, TfT-GA will exhibit somewhat erratic behavior in response, mimicking the unpredictability of the opponent. This can potentially exploit opponents who are looking for predictable strategies to defeat.

3. Being exploitative:
   - The strategy prioritizes immediate payoffs by cooperating when others do, but it also retaliates when opponents defect, causing a reduction in the stock level. This approach encourages cooperation and punishes defection, fostering a competitive yet fair environment.
   - By gradually adjusting reciprocity based on the opponent's long-term behavior, the strategy can exploit opponents who may be using simpler strategies that do not account for changing conditions or opponents who have inconsistent behavior patterns.

Pseudocode:
```
def TfT_GA(n, r, capacity, stock, round):

   - If an opponent has cooperated in the last round, reciprocate with cooperation. If they have defected, also defect.
   - In the last round, always cooperate, as it maximizes individual payoff in a single-shot game.
   - To be more adaptive and robust to various opponent behaviors:
      1. Keep track of how often an opponent has cooperated and defected over the entire game.
      2. If an opponent has cooperated less than 50% of the time, consider them a "defector" and react accordingly. Conversely, if they have cooperated more than 50% of the time, treat them as a "cooperator."
      3. In case of a tied percentage (exactly 50%), continue reciprocating their last action to maintain consistency in behavior.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the event of repeated ties or near-ties in cooperation percentage, TFTA may exhibit occasional deviations from strict reciprocity. However, it will always aim to maximize payoff by cooperating more often than defecting when the opponent has been relatively cooperative and vice versa.

3. Be exploitative:
   - TFTA is designed with an exploitative mindset by taking advantage of opponents who are less cooperative (defectors). It will cooperate with such opponents only when they show signs of increasing cooperation.
   - At the same time, it encourages cooperation among opponents who are already relatively cooperative, as this may lead to higher overall payoffs for both players in the long run.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growth Strategy (TFT-G)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - Initially in the first round, cooperate to foster cooperation and build stock for future rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, observe the opponent's previous action (C or D). If the opponent cooperated, also cooperate; if the opponent defected, defect in response.
   - Maintain a history buffer of the last r rounds to remember the opponent's behavior.
   - Introduce an adaptation parameter "a" (0 ≤ a < 1) that determines the rate at which TFT-G learns from past experiences. In each round t, if the opponent has cooperated in a proportion a of the last r rounds, choose to cooperate; otherwise defect.
   - Modify stock dynamics to include depletion from previous actions. The total consumption in each round is the sum of individual consumptions in that round and the accumulated consumption from the previous r-1 rounds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate to foster cooperation and build stock for future rounds.
   - In the last round, if the opponent has not fully depleted the common pool, defect to maximize individual payoff; otherwise cooperate as there is no further opportunity to accumulate stock or interact with the opponent.
   - If the opponent has defected in all previous r rounds, switch strategies after the first r rounds to an exploitative "always-defect" strategy to minimize the damage from opponents that are unwilling to cooperate.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - The TFT-G strategy is primarily cooperative, but it adapts to respond to opponent's actions. By defecting when the opponent has shown a pattern of defection, TFT-G can effectively punish opponents who do not follow cooperative norms and promote cooperation among those who demonstrate cooperative behavior.
   - The adaptation parameter "a" allows TFT-G to adjust its response to different levels of cooperation from the opponent, striking a balance between cooperation and exploitation based on past interactions.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TTAT-CT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, evaluate whether to cooperate or defect based on the average consumption rate (CR) of all players in the previous rounds and the current stock level:
   - If CR < Cooperative Threshold (CT), cooperate (C)
     Pseudocode: if CR < CT then return C
   - Else, defect (D)
     Pseudocode: else return D

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   In the first round, since there is no previous history, cooperate to avoid overexploitation and encourage cooperation among players:
   - First Round: Cooperate (C)
     Pseudocode: if round = 1 then return C

   For the last round, use the same decision rule as for regular rounds since the game continues until r rounds. However, consider saving some stock to ensure survival in case of low stocks at the end of the game:
   - Last Round: If stock > CT * n, cooperate (C)
     Pseudocode: if round = r and stock > CT * n then return C
   - Otherwise, defect (D) to maximize payoff in case of low stocks
     Pseudocode: else return D

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   The TTAT-CT strategy is designed to be exploitative by adjusting its cooperation threshold based on the behavior of other players. If opponents tend to cooperate, gradually increase CT to encourage defection and maximize payoff. Conversely, if opponents frequently defect, lower CT to respond with cooperation and punish defection.
   - Start with a low initial CT (e.g., 1)
     Pseudocode: initialize CT = 1
   - In each round, update CT based on the average consumption rate (CR) of all players in the previous rounds
     Pseudocode: CT += (CR - CT) * Learning Rate

   The learning rate determines how fast the strategy adjusts its cooperation threshold. A higher learning rate leads to quicker adaptation but may result in overshooting or instability, while a lower learning rate makes it more conservative and resistant to noise in opponent behavior.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TfT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

In TfT-ACT, the AI will start by cooperating in the first round to build trust and demonstrate a cooperative attitude. After the initial round, the AI will maintain cooperation as long as the average stock level (calculated over the last 'history_length' rounds) is above the predefined Cooperation Threshold (CT). If the average stock level falls below CT, the AI will defect in the next round to punish other players for depleting the resources too quickly.

If the current round is the last round, the AI will cooperate regardless of the average stock level because there are no further rounds to consider.

Pseudocode:
```
function TfT_ACT(history, history_length, CT):
  if current_round == 1:
    action = "C" (Cooperate)
  else:
    average_stock = calculateAverageStock(history, history_length)
    if average_stock > CT:
      action = "C" (Cooperate)
    else:
      action = "D" (Defect)

function calculateAverageStock(history, history_length):
  total_stock = sum(history[-history_length:])
  return total_stock / history_length
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

The initial cooperative action and the final round behavior are already covered in the decision rule pseudocode above. To further account for edge cases:

- If the history length is shorter than 'history_length', the AI will default to cooperation until it reaches the minimum required history length.
- If the average stock level calculation results in a division by zero error, the AI should calculate the average stock level based on the available history and continue making decisions accordingly.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

TfT-ACT is an exploitative strategy because it punishes opponents who deplete resources too quickly, forcing them to pay a cost in terms of lower payoffs. The cooperation threshold (CT) can be tuned to make the AI more or less aggressive in enforcing its interests. A lower CT encourages the AI to cooperate more frequently and punish opponents more harshly, while a higher CT results in fewer instances of punishment.

The key to TfT-ACT's exploitative nature lies in its adaptive response to the behavior of other players over time: by monitoring the average stock level, the AI can adjust its cooperation or defection strategy based on the current resource management state and trends. This adaptability allows it to maximize its payoff while also causing potential long-term consequences for opponents who consistently fail to maintain a sustainable common pool resource level.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   - In the first round, cooperate to promote cooperation and build trust with opponents. (C)
   - For subsequent rounds, observe opponent's action from the previous round. If they cooperated in the last round, cooperate in the current round. If they defected, also defect in the current round. This encourages cooperation while retaliating against defection. (If last_round_opponent_action == 'C', then act='C'; else act='D')
   - After detecting continuous defection for a certain number of rounds, switch to permanent defection to punish opponents and discourage future defections. (If defective_consecutive_rounds >= punishment_threshold, then act='D')

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, cooperate regardless of opponent's previous actions since no history exists. (As mentioned above)
   - In the last round, cooperate if the opponent has been cooperative throughout the game to encourage continued cooperation in future games. (If opponent_cooperated_throughout == True, then act='C')
   - If a punishment phase is active and the game reaches its final round, defect to maintain the punishment. (If defective_consecutive_rounds >= punishment_threshold and current_round == r, then act='D')

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   - By initially cooperating, the strategy hopes to encourage cooperation from opponents; however, if defection is detected, the strategy retaliates by defecting as well to punish the opponent. This can potentially discourage other players from taking advantage of the initial cooperative move.
   - The punishment phase ensures that continuous defection is not rewarded and that the strategy will not be exploited indefinitely.
   - It's important to note that while this strategy aims to promote cooperation, it does so within an exploitative framework by retaliating against defection. This makes the strategy robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors.

 Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATfT) for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to start on a positive note and conserve resources. (Cooperate(1) = True)
   - For subsequent rounds, if an opponent cooperated in the previous round, reciprocate by cooperating as well. If they defected, retaliate by defecting this round. This encourages cooperation while penalizing defection. (Cooperate(t)=!Defect(t-1))
   - In the last round, cooperate to conserve resources for future rounds if any. (Cooperate(r) = True)

2. Edge Cases:
   - If it's the first round (t = 1), start by cooperating regardless of opponent history.
   - In the last round (t = r), cooperate regardless of opponent's previous action.
   - In all other cases, use the ATfT decision rule as described above.

3. Exploitative Mindset:
   - By reciprocating cooperation and retaliating defection, this strategy aims to build trust and encourage opponents to cooperate, while punishing those who do not.
   - Simultaneously, the strategy will not hesitate to defect if an opponent does so first, taking advantage of their short-sightedness or aggression.
   - This adaptive approach should perform well against a wide range of strategies due to its simple, yet robust reciprocation mechanism.

 Title: Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
The Tit-for-Tat strategy begins by cooperating in the first round (C). For subsequent rounds, the strategy adopts the previous opponent's action from the last round. If the opponent cooperated, the player will also cooperate; if the opponent defected, the player will defect as well.

Pseudocode:
```
def tit_for_tat(opponent_action, round):
  if round == 1:
    return 'C' (Cooperate)
  else:
    return opponent_action[round-1]
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
The strategy will maintain its cooperative behaviour in the initial rounds and gradually become more defensive as the game progresses. In the final rounds, when the stock may approach zero due to accumulated consumption, the player switches to a purely exploitative approach (defecting).

Pseudocode:
```
def edge_cases(round, r, initial_cooperate):
  if round == 1:
    return initial_cooperate
  elif round <= int(r*0.7) and round != r:
    return 'C' (Cooperate)
  elif round > int(r*0.7) and round != r:
    return opponent_action[round-1]
  else:
    return 'D' (Defect)
```

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
By adopting a cooperative stance initially, the Tit-for-Tat strategy encourages other players to do the same. However, once the stock depletes significantly and the game enters its latter stages, the player becomes more aggressive by defecting to maximize their individual payoff. This makes the strategy robust against various opponent behaviours while still exploiting them when possible.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?

TfT-G maintains a "trust" level towards other players, represented by a counter that starts at zero and can range from 0 (least trust) to n (maximum trust). Initially, the trust level is set to zero for all opponents in each round. The strategy cooperates or defects based on its current trust level and the average trust level of the opponents.

- If the player's trust level is greater than the average trust level of the opponents: Cooperate (action C)
- Else if the player's trust level is equal to the average trust level of the opponents: Defect (action D)
- Otherwise (player's trust level is less than the average trust level of the opponents): Cooperate if stock > threshold, otherwise Defect (action D)

The threshold value is a parameter set to minimize initial exploitation while encouraging cooperation in later rounds.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

- In the first round: TfT-G defects, assuming that other players will initially take advantage of the situation and cooperating might lead to excessive stock depletion.
- In subsequent rounds: Players with lower trust levels have a higher probability of being exploited, so they are less likely to cooperate compared to those with higher trust levels.
- In the last round (r): If the player has accumulated sufficient payoffs, it may choose to defect to maximize its final earnings, regardless of the opponents' behavior. Otherwise, it will follow the decision rules as previously described.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset

- In the beginning: TfT-G is initially uncooperative to avoid being excessively exploited in the first round. This strategy aims to balance between cooperating too much and not cooperating enough, maximizing payoffs over the long run while minimizing initial exploitation.
- During the game: The trust level mechanism allows TfT-G to retaliate against opponents who defect repeatedly (lowering their trust level) or reward those who cooperate consistently (increasing their trust level). This encourages cooperation among more trustworthy players and helps TfT-G exploit less reliable opponents.

Pseudocode:

```
Initialization:
  - Set trust_level[i] = 0 for all i in {1, 2, ..., n} (opponents' trust levels)
  - Set threshold = capacity / (2 * n)

Round-by-round decision-making:
  - Calculate opponents' average trust level: avg_trust = sum(trust_level[i]) / n
  - If round = 1, defect: action = "D"
  - Else if stock > threshold and trust_level[i] > avg_trust: cooperate: action = "C"
  - Else if trust_level[i] == avg_trust: defect: action = "D"
  - Else if stock <= threshold or trust_level[i] < avg_trust: cooperate if stock > threshold, otherwise defect:
    if stock > threshold: action = "C"
    else: action = "D"

  - Play the chosen action (either C or D) and update payoff accordingly.

  - For each opponent i:
    if action was "C": trust_level[i] += 1
    elif action was "D": trust_level[i] -= 1

End of game (r rounds):
  - If player has accumulated sufficient payoffs, defect in the final round to maximize earnings: action = "D"

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Defection (TFTA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - Initially (first round), cooperate to build a foundation of trust and cooperation. This sets a baseline for subsequent rounds.
   - In subsequent rounds, mirror the opponent's actions from the previous round: if they cooperated, cooperate; if they defected, defect.
   - If an opponent deviates from their past behavior (either by cooperating after defecting or defecting after cooperating), revert to cooperating in the next round.
   - Introduce a threshold of consecutive defections (T) from the player's ideal cooperation behavior. When this threshold is reached, permanently switch to defect strategy towards the deviating opponent to punish them for their exploitative behavior.

2. Handling Edge Cases:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish a baseline of trust and cooperation.
   - In the last round, if no threshold has been reached, cooperate as a final attempt to rebuild any potential trust with opponents.
   - If an opponent deviates for the first time, wait one round before responding with the appropriate action (either cooperating or defecting) based on the new behavior observed.
   - When interacting with multiple opponents simultaneously, apply this strategy independently towards each opponent.

3. Being Exploitative:
   - The primary focus is to maintain a high stock level by cooperating most of the time, but respond harshly to opponents who deviate from cooperation. This creates an environment where cooperation can flourish unless other players choose to defect.
   - By punishing defection with permanent defection once a threshold is reached, TFTA ensures that exploitative behavior is met with equally damaging consequences, encouraging opponents to revert to cooperative strategies over time.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Stock Adaptation (TFTSA)

1. Decision Rules:
   - In the first round, cooperate to establish trust and set a baseline for potential long-term cooperation.
   - After the first round, adapt the strategy based on the opponent's actions in the previous round:
       - If opponent cooperates, reciprocate cooperation in the next round.
       - If opponent defects, defect in the next round to punish the defection and demonstrate a willingness to retaliate.
   - To account for stock dynamics, adjust the length of the "punishment" based on the remaining stock level after consumption:
       - If stock drops significantly (e.g., less than 50% of capacity), extend the punishment period to encourage opponents to cooperate and preserve resources.
       - If stock remains relatively high, shorten the punishment period to avoid unnecessary depletion of common pool resources.

2. Handle Edge Cases:
   - In the last round, prioritize maximizing individual payoff, irrespective of opponent's past actions, as there is no longer an opportunity for further interaction or retaliation.
   - If the stock level drops to zero due to excessive depletion, switch to a conservative strategy to prevent further collapse:
       - Cooperate indefinitely until the stock reaches 50% capacity, then resume TFTSA strategy.
   - Handle cases where opponent stops cooperating or switches strategies after extended periods of cooperation by re-evaluating the trustworthiness of the opponent and adjusting strategy accordingly (e.g., defecting to retaliate).

3. Be Exploitative:
   - By punishing defections with strategic delays in retaliation, the TFTSA strategy aims to encourage opponents to cooperate more frequently while still ensuring personal interests are prioritized.
   - The adaptive nature of the strategy allows it to respond to different opponent behaviors and exploit any perceived weaknesses or inconsistencies in their strategies.

Pseudocode:

 Title: Tit-for-Tat-Growth (TfT-G) Strategy for Common Pool Resource Game

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   In each round, TfT-G will initially cooperate and switch to defect based on the opponent's actions in the previous round and the current stock level. The strategy seeks to balance resource conservation with exploitation of opponents that fail to cooperate:

   - If the opponent cooperated in the previous round (both players consumed (2n)/(2*n) = 1/2 of the stock), then TfT-G will cooperate as well.
   - If the opponent defected in the previous round (the opponent consumed stock/(2*n) while TfT-G cooperated, consuming only stock/(2*n)), then TfT-G will defect in response. This represents a tit-for-tat response to exploitation.
   - In situations where the current stock level is critically low (stock <= 2n/3), TfT-G will always cooperate to prevent immediate collapse, even if the opponent defected previously. This rule prioritizes long-term resource preservation over short-term exploitation.

Pseudocode for decision rules:
```python
def decide_action(opponent_action_history, current_stock):
    if len(opponent_action_history) == 0:
        # First round
        return 'C'  # Cooperate

    last_round = opponent_action_history[-1]
    if last_round == 'C':
        if current_stock <= 2n/3:
            return 'C'  # Prioritize conservation when stock is low
        else:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate in response to previous cooperation
    elif last_round == 'D':
        return 'D'  # Defect in response to previous defection
    else:
        raise Exception("Invalid opponent action history")
```

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   TfT-G is designed to be adaptive and robust throughout the game, regardless of the number of rounds (r) or players (n). The strategy will cooperate in the first round due to its initial cooperative nature. In the last round, TfT-G will always cooperate, as it aims for mutual cooperation wherever possible:

   - For the first round, there is no opponent action history, so the decision rule defaults to cooperation.
   - The last round's actions have no impact on future games or resources, thus encouraging cooperation.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset
   While not as aggressive as pure exploitation strategies, TfT-G is designed to take advantage of opponents that fail to cooperate while still prioritizing resource conservation. By responding tit-for-tat to defection and prioritizing conservation in low-stock situations, the strategy seeks a balance between cooperation and exploitation. This adaptability makes it resilient against various opponent behaviors in a competitive setting.

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TTAT-ACT)

1. Specify decision rules - When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?
   TTAT-ACT starts by cooperating in the first round to build a positive relationship and avoid depleting the common pool too quickly. After that, it responds to opponents' actions based on its own past experiences:

   - If opponent cooperates (C), TTAT-ACT cooperates as well. This maintains a cooperative relationship.
   - If opponent defects (D) and the current stock level is above a certain threshold (StockThreshold), TTAT-ACT still cooperates to help recover the common pool.
   - If opponent defects (D) and the current stock level is below StockThreshold, TTAT-ACT defects as well to punish the opponent for depleting the common pool excessively.

   The StockThreshold is dynamically adjusted based on the average stock level from the previous r rounds:
   - If the average stock level has been above capacity / (2n), StockThreshold remains unchanged or increases slightly.
   - If the average stock level has been below capacity / (4n), StockThreshold decreases slightly.

2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?
   - In the first round, TTAT-ACT cooperates regardless of the opponent's action history.
   - At the end of the game, TTAT-ACT continues to use its decision rules based on the current state and StockThreshold.

3. Be exploitative - Clearly align with the exploitative mindset:
   TTAT-ACT's primary goal is to maximize its payoff by maintaining a reasonable balance between cooperation and punishment. It cooperates as long as it believes the opponent will also cooperate, but quickly punishes opponents who deplete the common pool excessively. By doing so, TTAT-ACT exploits cooperative opponents while minimizing potential losses when playing against defectors.

Pseudocode for TTAT-ACT:

```python
def play_game(n, r, capacity, stock):
    StockThreshold = capacity / (2 * n)
    average_stock = 0
    current_round = 1
    payoff = 0

        if current_round == 1 or opponent_history[-1] == 'C':
            action = 'C'
        elif stock < StockThreshold and opponent_history[-1] == 'D':
            action = 'D'

 Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Growth Adaptation (TFTGA)

1. Specify decision rules:
   - Start by cooperating in the first round (C). This sets a cooperative tone and builds trust.
   - In subsequent rounds, mimic the opponent's action from the previous round (i.e., if opponent cooperated in the last round, also cooperate; otherwise defect). This is the Tit-for-Tat (TFT) approach, which punishes defection but remains cooperative for cooperation.
   - To account for the stock growth, adjust the strategy as follows:
       - If the stock level has not fallen below a threshold (e.g., 75% of the capacity), continue using TFT.
       - If the stock level falls below the threshold and continues to decrease due to repeated defections, switch to always defecting (D). This is a punishment strategy aimed at recovering the resource pool.
       - Once the stock growth starts to increase again (i.e., the stock level rises above the threshold), revert back to TFT.

2. Handle edge cases:
   - In the last round, since there are no further rounds for recovery, always defect in order to maximize individual payoff.

3. Be exploitative:
   - By adapting to the resource level and opponent behavior, this strategy can capitalize on opportunities for cooperation when it benefits the player's long-term interests while still punishing repeated defection.
